Yes, Michael Moore has an agenda. However, every documentary does.
Believe it or not folks, but a documentary does not just show reality,
it also interprets it. Remember the experts that Ken Burns shows in all
of his documentaries? He used them to interpret the facts of the Civil
War, Jazz, and Baseball, among others. The Ken Burn's agenda just
wasn't as controversial as Michael Moore's.The point of a documentary is for those who see it to start making
their own judgments. If you don't agree with Michael Moore's
interpretation of the why's of the Iraq war, what is the right
interpretation? Can you use the facts or find more facts to come up
with a different interpretation? I would call that highly unlikely, but
I would like to see the interpretation.This documentary set out to answer the question "Why is the US in
Iraq?" I can tell you I have asked that question a lot and I found no
good reason. Michael Moore has done the same thing, just to a larger
audience. While you might disagree with his assessment that it was
strictly for money, it is hard to support a different view after seeing
this movie. You would be hard pressed to find any evidence linking Iraq
and Al-Qaeda. Why? Because it doesn't exist. No matter how much Bush
railed for a link, even he had to admit it wasn't there. I guess I would like to see a Republican version of events. I just
can't imagine what it would use as evidence. How can you refute the 7
minutes of inactivity of Mr. Bush in the Florida classroom on 9/11? How
can you refute the fact that planes were loaded up with Bin Laden
relatives on 9/13? How can you call the "coalition of the willing" a
coalition if it includes countries that send no troops? These are the
facts folks. Michael Moore interpreted them to slam the Bush
administration. I was saying the same thing before this movie. However,
I reach a small audience since I don't make movies. Thanks to Michael
Moore for making this film. Maybe some of the clueless, like Britney
Spears, will wake up and start questioning what is going on out there.
Because, Ms. Spears, in America, we are allowed to question the
president. He isn't God, he is a human being. So, pro-Iraq war people, give me your interpretation. Why? Why are we
there? Why don't we have Osama Bin Laden? Why?

"Fahrenheit 9/11" is an important film, dealing in detail with the
great issues of current American society, with a degree of skepticism
that our newsmedia has proven entirely incapable of exhibiting in the
last decade. Lone gadfly Michael Moore cannot singlehandedly reverse
the effects of a servile corporate media, but he can -- and does --
fling it right back in their faces. Is it any wonder televised
interviews with Moore have been less-than-cordial of late? It doesn't matter. For a film like this, any publicity is beneficial,
and Michael Moore has gone out of his way to thank his conservative
detractors for their support. As a movie, it's a whirlwind tour of corruption and diplomatic deceit
at the highest levels of the industrial-political machine, mixed with
direct examination of the lives of the "ordinary" people affected by
the decisions of the aristocratic few. Much like a roller-coaster ride,
it pulls you up the first steep incline with images of the 2000
presidential election followed by the major players in the bush
administration getting ready for their performances, and then comes the
first plunge: a stomach-wrenching drop into the black screen, with only
the sounds of that awful day in September when "everything changed".
Fade back in on the people of New York, confused, hurting, seeking
their loved ones in the rubble.  From here on, there is no stopping for breath. We observe the flight
of Saudi aristocrats who, but for their political connections, might
have been held as material witnesses. Moore depicts vividly the links
between the Bush family and their Saudi friends, one of whom (Prince
Bandar) "earns" the Bush surname. On it goes, fact after fact after
irrefutable and disgusting fact. Many of us entered the theatre
thinking we knew the score, but seldom has an overview of each tree led
to such a complete vision of the forest. Along the way, we'll see behavior from members of the bush
administration that cannot be described as flattering -- but once
again, this isn't up for debate. It's the facts, it's what they
themselves said. You can argue context, but the footage speaks for
itself. And more than anything else, this is where Michael Moore proves
he's grown as a director. No longer are his films chock-full of his
narrative, he lets the evildoers hoist themselves on their own petards
without as much overdubbed commentary. His statement rests in the
overall structure of the film, rather than his usual assortment of
shame-defying pecadillos and exposes. Which is not to say that fans of his spirited antics won't have
something to watch, as he drives around the capital building in an ice
cream truck reading the Patriot act to the representatives who never
bothered to read the legislation they passed, or chases after
congressmen trying to get them interested in enlisting their children
for a tour of duty in Iraq. Aaah, Iraq. The second half of the film deals with the buildup to and
execution of our current adventure in nation building. Iraq is shown
with a brief clip from before and a whole lot of after -- with its
people confused, hurting, seeking their loved ones in the rubble. Our
soldiers are also given plenty of time on-screen, time to describe what
it's like, time to proclaim the thrills, dangers, and ennui of life as
an occupying army. Far from being unsupportive as claimed by its
detractors, this film makes every effort to give the front-liners their
say. Wounded soldiers are treated with no less compassion than the
other victims in this film. And unlike the corporate newsmedia, Moore's
cameras dare to follow the injured to the Walter Reed medical center
and into their underfunded rehabilitation. And it follows the heart of a patriotic woman from Moore's hometown of
Flint whose soldier son makes the ultimate sacrifice for Bush's folly.This is, above all, a sympathetic, patriotic and humanistic movie. Even
its main star, George W. Bush, is given a measure of understanding. We
understand that he is out of his league, unable to push for the
appropriate diplomatic solutions with Saudi Arabia, forever beholden to
the corporate interests that purchased his throne, barely capable of
coherent thought, and not at all comfortable with the responsibilities
of the presidency. He would far rather be golfing, or "lookin' for
bugs", or hanging at fundraisers with "the haves and the have-mores";
the presidency is a burden he clearly cannot bear. He almost begs to be
removed from office.This movie has a lot more to say than any reviewer's encapsulation can
convey. Ignore the naysayers who, in all likelihood, haven't even seen
the film. Understand that the facts are the facts, the presentation is
Mr. Moore's, and your opinion is your own. My opinion: 10/10 -- If there's a documentary/editorial piece that
could touch this one, I haven't seen it yet.

To be fair, I should qualify this review by saying that I'm
progressive, a political science professor, anti-war, and a Bush
opponent. So I was hardly watching this film with an objective eye.That being said (and if you can still trust my review), Michael Moore
has done American voters a big service by making this film. It's not
without it weaknesses, namely the voice-overs where Moore speculates on
Bush's thoughts during those endless blank stares. But for once, Moore
has made a film that is woven together with a chronological and
thematic logic that ultimately asks one critical question: Is it that
the Powers that Be don't understand, or that they simply don't believe
in, true democratic principles? While George W. Bush is the primary
subject of the film's critiques, the Democrats are not left unscathed.
In fact, the first 10 minutes are devoted to a skewering of the
Democratically-controlled Senate (including, ironically, former V.P.,
Senate President, and Presidential contender Al Gore.) Moore's
commentary here, as with his past films, revolves around the
relationship between money and power, and how that connection degrades
democracy and in its most insidious form, leads to the loss of innocent
lives. While he holds the Bush family and key administration officials
most directly accountable, Moore does not let anyone off the hook. This
includes not just the usual suspects (Saudi Arabia), but the Democratic
leadership, the Supreme Court, the media, and finally, the American
voters. Nothing here is new to anyone who has spent any time perusing
the alternative or progressive media in the past four years, but the
effect is substantial because Moore has finally shown himself to be a
true documentarian, and has woven together a coherent picture of the
connections between the players and the events from December 2000 to
the present. Setting aside the few moments of Moore's own commentary
and some silly interjections of old westerns, the message ultimately
relies on the presentation of documents, images, and interviews. The
facts are so tight that the worst anyone can say about the veracity of
the film is that it is biased, a critique that will carry far less
weight when compared to the snippets of Fox news propaganda spliced
into the movie.Moore will be called anti-American, unpatriotic, and probably a
fascist. This, of course, is the last resort of a regime and its
supporters who have no credible challenge to the facts of the film,
only to its message. Ultimately, all audiences, regardless of their
political proclivities, should be able to see that Moore is anything
but anti-American or anti-democratic. The single biggest piece of the
film is devoted to following around the mother of a soldier killed in
Iraq. She is a patriot and a "true American", by any definition. Her
son, and the thousands like him, are honored by Moore. They are
portrayed as heroes, but also as victims. They are protectors of
American security, but also pawns in a global struggle for power.By finally asking the right questions (4 years too late??), Moore has
shown himself to be not just a solid filmmaker, but a patriot and a
defender of the most sacred American liberty- free expression.

Moore's film strips away the pseudo patriotic facade of the Bush
administration with humor and tragedy to create a very compelling but
flawed message: Bush used false pretenses to go to war while enriching
his friends and letting the common people suffer the fallout. The film
moves between powerfully tragic scenes( like the sound of planes flying
into the Towers as the screen is blacked out to interviewing a dead
soldier's mom) to parody( Bush and Cheney dressed like cowboys in a
scene with Bonanza music in the background. Moore raises several
provocative questions such as why did Bush sit for seven minutes in an
elementary classroom without reacting? Moore suggests answers which
imply Bush didn't know what to do. Moore raises questions and suggests
answers which right wing critics find abhorrent. His film techniques of
showing a triumphant, strutting Bush proclaiming major military
operations are over and quickly cutting to a roadside bomb in Iraq
exploding, showing Bush as either ignorant, stupid, or mendacious were
very powerful. Moore's weakness was in trying to give his audience too
many messages in a single film but he comes very close to succeeding.
His success was apparent to many right wing radio hosts, who
immediately declared him both a liar and antiamerican(or America
hating).

Everyone is entitled to their opinions. The biggest help you can give
to your fellow people is to read, watch and know, that's all. can you
do that? watch and decide for yourself, you're human, you have a brain,
why let me and the opposing critics tell you what to do? You will
listen to Americans' testimonies, the soldiers, the everyday people of
US and Iraq. You will see Americans' rights destroyed. You will hear it
from their lips. The movie is not an attack on a country or its people,
only on the person who is benefiting from their loss. It just states
facts that you or me as North Americans wouldn't easily find unless we
went looking for it, which is what we should do, but most don't have
the time. I've watched countless crappy movies and I'm sure you have
too. So spending 2 hours and a few dollars to watch something that
might change the way you think of today's so called democracy, is a
must. You might not agree, but chances are...you will after watching
it. If it wasn't telling the truth it wouldn't have the bush supporters
after to destroy it. And if you notice most people either really like
it or really hate it. and those who really hate it are the ones that
don't really love their country. Because this movie is quite
sympathetic to the soldiers but not to the one who sent them there for
his reasons and not the people's.it's just 2 hours. watch it. other recommended features: The
corporation, Manufacturing consent, Bowling for columbine. all get
10/10 for truth.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very powerful and emotionally moving film. My
partner and I went with four friends on opening weekend, ages 19 to 56,
and we all had tearful moments in between the many laughs and guffaws.
One of our friends, who has never voted in the 6 years since he turned
18, has now been moved to become more involved in the political
process. This film is not just about "Bush is Bad" but really looks at
how the tendrils of big business can, and do, shape the direction our
government takes, and where the current administration has gone off
track. Be prepared for a few grisly war scenes, but remember, it's
nothing compared to what our men and women there have to deal with.
Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, you should give this film the
opportunity to move you!

'Fahrenheit 9-11' added fuel to the fire of Michael Moore's
increasingly toasty reputation as a documentarian, and it's not
difficult to see why. The film, while featuring several scenes that are
extremely moving, feels hastily put together (a problem also suffered
by 'Bowling for Columbine') and occasionally tone-deaf (e.g., the long,
long sequence where Moore traces the connections between the Bush
family and the Saudis--based in fact, but not inspiring the kind of
shocked indignation he clearly expects it to). But worst of all, it's
not interested in persuading anyone of anything--if you're not already
a card-carrying lefty (which I *am*, for the record) you might as well
not apply. Moore's defenders like to point out the fallacy of a truly
objective documentarian--any filmmaker, they say, by choosing what to
show and what not to show, is projecting his own perspective and
judgment into the mix. This is certainly true, but just as in narrative
film, there's a difference between telling the viewer what to think and
allowing him to figure it out for himself. 'Roger and Me' achieves the
latter; 'Fahrenheit 9-11,' with Moore's mocking speculations dubbed
over Bush's face, does not. It's a shame, really, because the movie's
purer moments are very effective indeed--there isn't a better way to
express the horrors of war than to look at the parents of casualties.
And yet Moore's smug partisanship, apparent from the very beginning,
prevents anyone not predisposed to agree with him from getting close
enough to his information to judge for themselves. It's a shame,
really--but then again, why should they want to? Moore gives them no
incentive to convert. 5.5 out of 10.

I went to see this film with some reservations, since although I enjoyed
Bowling for Columbine I found it far too biased to be taken seriously.
Sadly, although some valid points were made in Fahrenheit 9/11, the same
thing is true here and in spades.[I'm not sure if it's possible to write spoilers about a documentary, but
I'll mention some of the things shown in the film.]Moore begins by making a case that the Bush family has strong links with
many wealthy Arabs and as a result George W either covered up or hindered
investigations into the 9/11 attacks to protect his links with his Arab
friends. If true, it's obviously scandalous, although it wouldn't really
surprise me.My main problem with the film is that many of the topics covered are chosen
in such a way to try to sway the audience to his way of thinking although
they really aren't directly relevant to the point he is trying to make. For
example, to argue against the Iraq war, Moore begins by showing pictures of
happy children playing in Baghdad before the attacks, and then pictures of
grieving parents and dead children's bodies after the attacks. He also has
an extended sequence with a grieving American mother whose son was killed in
action in Iraq. Besides being biased (no scenes of Saddam gassing the Kurds
are shown, for example), scenes such as this are largely irrelevant to a
consideration of whether the war was justified. Any mother who loses a son
is going to grieve and feel resentment at whatever took her son's life,
whether it was a war or a car accident, but it contributes nothing to a
reasoned critique of the war in Iraq.In an attempt to show that the US had very little backing in going to war,
Moore lists a number of "silly" countries, such as Romania and Morocco, that
supported the US with the implication that it was only insignificant
countries that supported the Americans. No mention is made anywhere in the
film of Britain's involvement in the war, apart from one picture of Tony
Blair in a simulated cowboy hat.Don't get me wrong - I have no respect or love for Bush and don't believe
the war in Iraq was justified either. I just don't see how films such as
this can do much to further the cause. We need a proper documentary that
considers all sides of all the arguments and comes to a reasoned
conclusion.

It is very easy to point and criticize. It is far easier to do when there is
no-one around to counter your criticism. Fahrenheit 911 is a finger pointing
exercise that I simply did not enjoy. It is not bad  just the opposite. It
is skilfully made, funny and very well organized. I strongly encourage
everyone to see it and judge for themselves. But it is culpable and
hypocritical, and its approach to its own content so questionable, that it
must be dismissed as nothing more than entertainment.I did not hate the film. I laughed on a number of occasions. Moore's ability
to match a song with a newsreel clip to underline his point (the best being
the use of `The Greatest American Hero' theme), his sarcastic, easy to
listen to narration is excellent. It is not a quality film . It is primarily
archived newsreel footage strung together with voiceover work and vintage
Moore interviews. It is very well assembled, but as a documentary, it fails.
Mr. Moore grandstanded at the Oscars two years back that he is a film maker
that lives in the world of non-fiction. I heartily disagree.The factual content is laughable. Most notably, Moore asks someone what the
total wealth held by Saudis in the USA is. The man answers `I have heard it
is as high as $840 billion dollars'. That is hardly a statement of fact
backed up by anything. Good enough for Moore though. Next scene, he is
speaking of the `trillion dollars' held by Saudis in the US (what's
$140Billion between friends), then proceeds to say that they own 7% of the
United States. One piece of conjecture stretched to the
extreme.The movie is racist. Yes, racist. As he decries Bush's ties with the Saudis,
he flashes a seemingly endless parade of photos of American shaking hands
with Arabs, as if anyone and everyone who has ever met one is of
questionable character. And the shots he cuts to when he mentioning the
countries in the `Coalition of the Willing' are offensive, showing Vikings
when he mentions Iceland and other stereotypical photos of countries like
Cost Rico and Morocco, and someone smoking hash when he mentions the
Netherlands.The movie is manipulative beyond any measure I have seen. Two examples here.
Moore is willing to completely demonize Saudi Arabia, talking of their human
rights violations and even showing a public beheading performed by their
government. Pre-war Iraq is shown as some kind of Utopia, with people
gleefully shopping in markets, children playing and most nauseatingly, a
young boy flying a kite up the bank of a river. Even worse than that however is Lila Lipscombe. She is from Moore's hometown
of Flint Michigan and is interviewed extensively in the middle part of the
movie, telling Moore how proud she is that her children enlisted in the
army, how it is a duty and a privilege, on and on and on. Later on, we find
out her son was tragically killed in a Black Hawk accident, and Lila now
curses Bush, the government, the Whitehouse and the war. The hypocrisy and
manipulation of those scenes made me squirm out of my seat. I am a parent
and my heart breaks for this woman losing her son. But they way it is
presented, simply for effect, is offensive.  It also smacks horribly of
Moore's famous editing of the facts for effect.Many times in this film, people mention that the terror threat just does not
exist. That Saddam was not a threat. That Iraq had never killed an American
(Gulf War?). That no weapons exist in Iraq.  What world are these people
living in? Why is never mentioned that Iraq was run a brutal and murderous
regime and routinely killed its own people, that used WMDs against its own
people, that killed anyone who opposed the government, that Saddam was a
multi-billionaire in an impoverished country? Moore could have balanced his
approach like this, and still not lost it. I believe he could have
strengthened his film by showing Iraq for what it was, and not creating a
fictional account of life there.The greatest point Moore makes is in the interview with a retired FBI agent,
who questions the removal of 250 or so Arab citizens from the US post 9/11,
by air, when all air traffic in the US had been grounded. They should have
been questioned by FBI, especially those who are related to Bin Laden
directly. Also, Moore does an excellent job of outlining the Bush insiders
and their ties to the oil industry.There may be a great film to be made about the Bush administration. This is
not it.The worst thing about this movie for me, though was the pall of hypocrisy
that hung over it. As Moore decries the war profiteers, he becomes one.  As
he accuses the US government of exploiting the poor and marginalized of the
US for profit, he does the same. As Fahrenheit 911 approaches $100,000,000
in domestic receipts, I sat in the theatre thinking that Moore himself is as
big a war profiteer as any of his targets.

If BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was subjective and somewhat inaccurate there
can be no adjectives used to describe FARENHEIT 9/11 . It is polemical
documentary making of the worse sort that will change no ones mind on
anything in which case it deserves to be ignored , but since there
seems to be a cult that think Michael Moore is the greatest thing
that's happened to humanity for two thousand years a few points .Moore asks if the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis why didn't America invade
Suai Arabia instead of Afghanistan ? The same reason Britain didn't
invade the Republic of Ireland in the 1970s to defeat the IRA because
as the Irish Republic didn't train , arm , or fund the provisional IRA
neither does the government of Saudi Arabia train , arm or fund Al
Qaeda . In fact Al-Qaeda has vowed to over throw the Saudi government (
Same as during the 1970s the IRA vowed to over throw the Republic's
government ) and replace it with an Islamic theocracy . For someone
who's supposedly educated Moore should have known this and she should
also know that Taliban controlled Afghanistan was indeed being used as
a massive terrorist training camp for Islamic terrorists from all over
the world , same as he should know that the Taliban and Mujahedeen are
two different things and that the " Northern Alliance " who fought the
Taliban since 1996 were effectively the Mujahedeen . Moore doesn't
state that both the Taliban and Mujahedeen are the same entity but by
using choice words like " Afghans " and " Islamic fundamentalists
fighting the Russians " that's what he is trying to imply to his
unquestioning fan baseTalking of Afghanistan leads us to the main problem with FARENHEIT 9/11
- The internal self contradiction . In 2001 Moore publicly criticised
the invasion of Afghanistan saying there was no evidence that Bin Laden
was involved and as the documentary states earlier the hi-jackers were
Suadis not Afghans . In short Moore is against the invasion of
Afghanistan but then spends time telling his audience that because Bush
didn't into Afghanistan quick enough and without enough men this
allowed Bin Laden to escape . What is Moore trying to say ? That if he
was in charge he's had invaded Afghanistan quicker and with more men ?
What are you saying Mickey ? There's another similar point with similar
illogical points that come across as self contradictions: Moore laments
that the anti terrorist laws are repressive then points out a few
seconds later that there's not enough state funding to police the
border areas of Oregon . Moore's against the anti-terror legislation
but he wants more border security to police the anti- terror laws ? Is
that what he's saying ? He also makes it quite clear in the same
segment that Fresno peace groups don't look like terrorists . Indeed
they don't and no one has ever came up with any criteria as to what an
average terrorist looks like . Go to the Gaza strip or West Bank and
you'll see that the average terrorist looks like the average man ,
woman ( Or in some extreme cases ) child except that they're skin is a
slightly different shade from that of the average Fresno peace group
member . Is Moore being latently racist I wonder ? In keeping with the same irony/self contradiction the best worst bits
from the documentary take place in Iraq , a country we're led to
believe that was under Saddam a beautiful utopia where children played
on the streets , men and woman sat outside street corner cafes with
well prepared inexpensive lunches and everyone smiled only to have
everything ruined by a war of aggression by America . We're then shown
dead Iraqi babies and American wounded screaming in pain . Shocking
scenes but one without any context . We're not shown say , the
thousands of Kurds who were murdered by Iraqis during the 1980s , or
the Kuwaits who were murdered by Saddams forces in 1990 or the hundreds
of thousands of Iranians who were killed by Saddams forces during the
Gulf war of the 1980s . War is always a sickening business featuring
the very worst of human nature - I mean if Michael Moore had a film
camera and gone to the Serb held areas of Bosnia in 1995 after NATO
air-strikes he could have filmed similar scenes amongst civilian
casualties , same as he might have if he showed the aftermath of NATO
air-strikes against Serbia in 1999 . I wonder why he didn't ? Was it
because the Democrats were in the White House at the time ? You might
like to remember that Moore backed Wesley Clark as the Democratic
nomination in the race for the White House , the same Wesley Clark who
was in charge of the NATO air-strikes in the Balkans that killed
civilians I could say much more on this polemical piece of nonsense like Moore's
ridiculous oil pipeline theory but I won't bother since like this
fantasy drama from Moore no one will have their minds changed . I will
say one thing though , as unlikely as it may seem by reading this
review I was against the invasion of Iraq even though I could
understand the reasons behind it and Dubya would have stood or fallen
via the 2004 American presidential vote on this decision . Moore had
nothing to lose by making this documentary and because of his
unquestioning fan base everything to gain . If Dubya hadn't invaded
Iraq we wouldn't have got FARENHEIT 9/11 so enjoy the money and awards
this movie brings you Mickey because people died for it

Fahrenheit 9/11 is quite possibly the best work of Michael Moore's
career. Moore still has the talent to get people talking while even
working in a bit of comedy into the film.The plot revolves around the Bush Administration and what has gone on
from the years 2000-2004. It explores many interesting aspects of what
has gone on while George W. has been in office. The film raises
questions and controversy of course but has the facts to back up their
claims. What you see will shock and amaze you. You may also cry when
faced with the harsh realities the film reveals.Whether you love it or hate it, Fahrenheit 9/11 will undoubtedly get
people talking which was Michael Moore's aim. My personal opinion is it
was very well put together and Moore should be admired for his courage
to question the way things are being done. Form your own opinion once
you have seen it but the movie will impact you no matter your political
affiliation.

It it truly amazing that after 6 years of evidence of Bush Cheney
duplicity and shenanigans piling up - from the media, in Congress, even
in the Pentagon and the CIA - that right-wing loonies still waste their
time attacking this film, the majority of its charges proved true and
the majority of Americans now convinced that they are true. Thus
revealing their true color - yellow: they are such whining crybabies!
Like Georgie boy, all they really wanted was some excuse to kill
innocent women and children of a different skin color. SICK!
Fortunately their day is done - George Bush enters history as the most
corrupt, weakest, dumbest and most hated president in the history of
America. And his sycophants are quickly exposing themselves as
unAmerican, unpatriotic, treasonous blow-hards that care little for the
good of the nation, eagerly seeking opportunities to rob Americans of
their precious tax-dollars for their friends at Halliburton (which is
now no longer an American corporation but operates out of Dubai - just
as Cheney, after a brief visit to Wyoming, will soon be retiring to to
his vacation home in Saudi Arabia). Yes, a lovely bunch of traitors,
all! Farewell as they enter the dustbin of history! This now thoroughly validated film by Michael Moore stands as an
indictment, not only of the Bush regime's barbaric lust for colonial
conquest, but of the culpability of the mainstream media that failed to
report the truth of Bushcheney shenanigans until America was too deeply
entrenched to withdraw, and its economy bankrupted by this preposterous
war. I don't know if its a great film, but it's an absolutely necessary
historical document. Hopefully, we will soon be dragging Bush to court
for war crimes and treason - to see some of the reason why - and to
remember NEVER AGAIN to allow America to swing right for the sheer
enjoyment of bloodshed - watch this film - it's unforgettable. AND IT'S
ALL TRUE!

I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 at Phipps Mall in the affluent Buckhead neighborhood
of Atlanta, GA, and I will say for the record:1.  Fahrenheit 9/11 attracted the most racially integrated audience I've
ever seen at an Atlanta movie theater, as well as the most age-diverse
audience.2.  The audience was completely in tune with what Michael Moore was trying
to do.  When he wanted you to be mad, people were mad.  When he wanted you
to be upset, people were upset, and when he wanted you laugh, people
laughed.  And boy, did they laugh.3.  The audience cheered (loudly) upon the film's conclusion.Truly a satisfying moment, to feel part of a community of people, if only
for two hours, who recognized that the emperor indeed has no clothes. Is Michael Moore manipulative? Of course- he's an editorial documentarian. 
Does he sometimes assume too much from too little information?  Of course-
he's a human being.  That's what human beings do.  Now, you may say, yes, it
may be human nature to infer too much from too little information, but as a
responsible artist, Michael Moore should get his ducks firmly in a row
before trying to manipulate his audience.  That being said, we have libel in
slander laws in this country.  If Michael Moore is so far off base, where
are the lawsuits and defamation of character charges?  Why won't Bush or his
camp respond to any of the specific allegations of Fahrenheit 9/11?  Why is
that, in fact, they state an unwillingness even to see the film, and yet
feel qualified to have a valid opinion of it?  Now who's inferring too much
from too little?What is absolutely undeniable is that a) war is horrible, b) the United
States of America went to war with Iraq for spurious reasons, c) we have
been conspicuously unsuccessful in capturing Osama bin Laden, in part
because bin Laden has no relationship whatsoever with Iraq, d) there have
been many people who have benefited financially from the war, and those
people have a long and in many cases sordid relationship with the Bush
family, and e) Bush has used the 9/11 attacks as a way to advance an agenda
that is completely unrelated to the attacks themselves, and to infringe on
our civil rights.  Any attempt to dissect Michael Moore's arguments fall
flat when these basic facts are irrefutable.Fahrenheit 9/11 is ultimately a highly entertaining and justifiably scathing
review of the Presidency of George W. Bush, embarrassment to himself, our
great nation, and, for that matter, to the entire human race.  Please help
vote this buffoon out of office before he can discredit our country
further.

First of all, this movie is truly not for the weak of stomach. There
are some pretty graphic scenes (real video) of public beheading,
corpses, wounded soldiers/civilians, explosions, etc...Taken as a whole, this movie was very interesting and probably one of
the most unique I've seen in theaters.My one complaint is that it will really sway the ignorant or
impressionable in way that isn't entirely fair. The reason behind this
is Moore's way of presenting his arguments. He'll begin by giving some
facts that will draw the audience in (and make then believe that they
are being force fed truths), and then he'll make suggestions or
conclusions about other details based on his personal opinion. If
you're not watching carefully, it's possible to be tricked into
believing that something that is not a fact, is.This being said, it is definitely something everyone should see. I also
encourage you to watch it with an open mind, and keep in mind that it
is a very biased point of view.

When Michael Moore's controversial documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" was
released in the summer of 2004, it hit a readiness reaction with a
large segment of the American public, people who found themselves
increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the country was taking
under the Bush administration and who believed that, in this film,
someone for the first time was finally giving voice, in a mass media
outlet, to their deepest held fears and concerns. Let's face it; no
fiction writer could have concocted a more bizarre and surrealistic
series of events than what actually occurred in the United States in
the first few years of this millennium: a contested Presidential
election followed by a terrorist attack of unprecedented proportions
followed by a "retaliatory" war aimed at the wrong country and based
almost entirely on faulty intelligence. These three incidents converged
to create a near "perfect storm" for Moore's documentary. It also
didn't hurt, from a commercial point of view, that the film was
released in the heat of a bruising Presidential campaign, one in which
the stakes never seemed higher for both ends of the political spectrum
in the country. The 2004 Presidential election would be a fight to the
death, one whose motto was clearly: may the better ideology win.Well, it has been a year since Moore's film hit the streets and almost
as long a time since Bush won reelection for a second term as
president. The question to be asked now is, with the passions on both
sides cooled down to at least some extent (or are they?), how does
"Fahrenheit 9/11" play in a post-election world? The answer is pretty
damn well actually, mainly because most of the issues Moore raises are
still as valid after the election as they were before (mainly because
Bush WAS reelected).Moore is, of course, an unapologetic liberal and a self-appointed
gadfly for the powers-that-be in our society. As such, he aims his
sights directly at the Bush administration and all those who support
it. He starts off brilliantly by recalling the horrors of 9/11 in a
unique way: showing us a black screen while the sounds of the planes
crashing into the buildings are heard on the soundtrack. With memories
of that horror still lingering in our heads, Moore then proceeds to
expose the Bush family's long standing connections with the Saudi royal
family, a fact that few people seemed aware of before this film was
released. Moore then goes on to criticize the way in which the Bush
administration has exploited the "War on Terror" for maximum political
effectiveness, culminating in the Patriot Act which, he argues, has had
a draconian impact on the civil rights of ordinary American citizens.But the greatest part of Moore's wrath is saved for the second half of
the film, when he confronts what he sees as the wholly unjustifiable
war in Iraq. Moore is to be given credit for being one of the first and
only people to have shown us actual on-the-ground pictures of the death
and carnage that occurred in that country immediately after the initial
bombings. Watching these gruesome images, we are immediately struck by
just how antiseptic the media's coverage of the war has been here in
the United States - a fact that Moore blames not only on the Bush
administration but on a press that has allowed itself to become little
more than an extension of the rah-rah, war-rallying propaganda machine
set up by the government (a government, for instance, that refused to
allow any pictures to be taken of flag-draped coffins coming back from
the war zone).The section dealing with the Iraq War is the most emotionally
devastating section of the film, mainly because Moore is able to bring
it home to us personally through the ordinary individuals who have been
most directly affected by it - soldiers on the field, amputees in the
hospital and, most heartbreakingly, the mother of a boy killed in a
helicopter crash in April, 2003. Her unbearable grief, so nakedly
exposed on camera for all to see, becomes an emblem for a war that not
only need not have happened, but has, as Moore points out in various
ways, been largely bought and paid for with the blood of brave men and
women from the lower, underprivileged tier of society. He ends his film
by confronting a number of congressmen who voted for the war but who
seem reluctant to send their own children over to do the actual
fighting. Actually, there is so much going on in this film that it
becomes virtually impossible to convey even half of it in a short
review such as this one.As with his previous films, Moore once again proves himself the master
of facile irony, pointing out, in darkly humorous fashion, the absurd
inconsistencies and blatant hypocrisies that abound in the world around
us. These moments are what keep Moore's films from becoming dry-as-dust
jeremiads against what he sees as a corrupt system. He makes us laugh
even when we know we should be crying, but this is the way a polemicist
reaches his audience. And no one understands that better than Michael
Moore.Is the film "fair," "balanced," "nonpartisan" in its approach?
Absolutely not. Does it need to be? Well, I can certainly see where
people of the opposite political persuasion might find themselves
wanting to yell back at the screen or lob a few well chosen projectiles
where they feel it would do the most good. And that's fine too. After
all, it's a free country and the Bush supporters have every right to
launch their own rebuttal against this film if they so choose. I would
truly love to see it. But until that time both liberals and
conservatives will have to be content with kicking the set every time
"Fahrenheit 9/11" is appearing on the screen. The funny thing is that
they'll be doing so for entirely different reasons.

Without too much doubt, Michael Moore is the pre-eminent cinematic muckraker
of our time--from 1989's ROGER AND ME to 2002's BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, the
man from Flint, Michigan has put his money where his mouth is.  And now,
with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, he has outdone himself by leaps and bounds, provoking
a firestorm of response, both pro and con, that I have not seen in quite
some time.Done with savagely ironic narration by Moore himself, this is a chilling
expose about the administration of George W. Bush, from the Florida debacle
to the horrors of the 9/11 attacks and the rush to the war in Iraq and
beyond.  We all may have seen the mountain of footage that Moore has
assembled for this film time and time again on our TV screens the last four
years, but there's a lot more.  We see the connections between the Bush
family and Osama Bin-Laden; Dick Cheney's connections with Haliburton; the
complicity of the mainstream media to go along with Bush; the passage of the
so-called Patriot Act, which not a single member of either body of Congress
even bothered to READ, much less object to.  And even more, we see Moore and
his crew try to get people in Congress to enlist their kids to go fight in a
war that they force other kids from lower-income families to fight.  Of the
535 members of the House, both the Senate and the Congress, only one has
anyone in their immediate family serving over there in
Iraq.Undoubtedly, there are those apologists who will slam Moore and his film as
being totally unpatriotic and traitorous.  But from the first few days after
the 9/11 attacks to the release of this film, those same apologists in the
news media--Rush Limbaugh; Ann Coulter; Sean Hannity, Chuck Scarborough,
etc.--have bombarded us with their own right-wing, indeed borderline
fascist, pro-war propaganda and have reduced words like "patriotism",
"freedom", and "democracy" to punchlines.  Of course, neither of these
people has ever served in combat.  Even if he is a left-wing propagandist,
Moore and his film merely serve to balance the scales; and if it means that
the far-right's apple cart turns over, then so be it.  Moore is only doing
what is his RIGHT to do, what our soldiers are supposedly DYING for--calling
it like he sees it under the First Amendment, the same as Limbaugh and
friends.  And by asking the tough questions, probing without fear, and
willing to make us look at ourselves without shame and realize why we are
where we are now, Moore defines what it is to be an American and a
patriot--someone who is willing to fight for common people.To me, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 joins a select group of politically-oriented films
that deserve to be called masterpieces because they provoke discussion,
debate, and thought.  It was true with DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, ALL THE
PRESIDENT'S MEN, and JFK, and it is true here.  It is infuriating and
provocative, and any film that manages to be those things should be seen at
least once.

This movie is awesome. It nails Bush to the wall with his own words. I
have never seen anything like it. It is the most important movie of our
lifetimes, and I recommend you see it immediately if at all possible.
This is your chance to get involved in the political life of the
nation. Don't let the lies of the radical right keep you from seeing
this movie. The future of the U.S. and of the whole world depends on
you and your vote. If you don't believe me, look at how small the
margin was that Gore won over Bush and how easily it was turned around
by the Republican justices on the Supreme court. Don't let that happen
again. SEE THIS MOVIE IF IT'S THE ONLY MOVIE YOU SEE ALL YEAR.

...But Michael Moore wasn't using hindsight when he produced this film.
Everything he has explained in this film has come completely true.This now is a great historical piece that details one of the largest
thefts in the history of the world: the bush crony cash bonfire that is
the Iraq operation--the three trillion dollar war (if not more).If only people would have listened to his prescient words at the time.
we could have saved a fortune in lives and treasure.*spoilers*one of my favorite moments is when one of the crony contractors
gleefully explains how great this war is going to be for the
contractors. "not so good for the people, but great for the
contractors."who knows how many billionaires bush and Cheney made out of their
dangerous cronies. we will have to be dealing with their new found
power for years to come.

With every single Michael Moore film you feel you get less and less.Now I am a big fan of Roger and Me and I thought Bowling for Columbine
was flawed but brilliant.Due possibly too internet fan comments Moore is seen less than usual in
this film but it still feels like a massive ego trip. As usual Moore
uses specially selected footage to make someone look stupid. This time
its President Bush, which is not hard.About half way threw the film you begin to wonder what Moores point is
as he side tracks of subject. Okay so some of it makes sense but then
Moore will then show Iraq as a nice happy place, before America and
Britian invaded.When I saw the film in Manchester people walked out, now I have to
wonder whether this was out of disagreement or boredom.A great opening and ending and some good and funny moments along the
way, but all in all too boring and with no point what so ever.

Michael Moore is the ultimate spin-doctor but he's not a very focused
documentary filmmaker. He takes TV news segments from the past few
years and slants them in his favor via canny editing techniques. His
assessment of the George W. Bush administration, and Bush's apparent
bungling of affairs in post-9/11 America, wanders into the murkiest of
political waters, with only Moore's dryly sarcastic voice-over to punch
up what we're seeing. It isn't very entertaining, but should it be? I
felt the narrative wandering after the first hour, with too many
targets on the agenda and FAR TOO MUCH television news footage to slog
through. The political players all end up looking like irresponsible
buffoons, which would be amusing if it weren't so terrifying. Moore
wants to tread humorously through some of these passages, and his
appeals to our collective sense of humor are welcomed, however the
overall feel of "Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of pasted-together jabs: some
forceful, some sardonic, and some simply meager. ** from ****

I checked out Dave Kopel's site after watching this movie and found
that the movie is an interesting blend of half-truths, almost-truths,
and not-even-close-to-truths pieces. Using this creative technique one
can make a movie about everything from abortions between male teenagers
to Australians winning the Australian Open. All you need for that is a
camera man and no conscience.I was grown up in the Soviet Union and the movie painfully resembles
the documentary from my childhood scourging the capitalistic system.
The only difference is that Mike somehow managed to take advantage of
the system he apparently hates so much. Thus, I really do not
understand what the fuss is about in some comments and why this movie
is "a must see." If those who wrote that think that the movie is a
great piece of art, they are probably mistaken. If they think that
Moore made a good point, they are mistaken as well as nobody can make a
strong statement fabricating the facts.I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican but I feel that the party
playing all those dirty propaganda tricks deserves not to be elected.

First of all, this is my first review, and I don't speak English very
well, so...Well, I like most of what Moore has done, and I think that this is not
the better of him, and it doesn't deserve to won the Palme D'Or at all.
But I still think that this one deserves to be watched. Moore is using
here most of what he did explain (greatly) on "Bowling for Columbine".
There he explain how assimilated is violence in the nowadays
unitedstatian (I will not say American since America is a continent and
not a country) society. Fahrenheit 9/11 works a lot with this, and how
normal is for the unitedstatians to invade a country in the name of the
freedom values, democracy values, and so on, which are actually the
economic interests of a small private group that has no ethic and just
want to take profits, like it happen on Vietnam, Chile, Afghanistan,
Iraq, and many many others. I disagree with Moore in this movie, 'cause
he's attributing most of this to the ineptitude of Bush, and this is
not like that. A man as intelligent as Moore is, should have realized
that the 9/11 attacks were done deliberately, or at least allowed, by
Bush Government, in order to be able to invade countries and to steal
their resources, just like the us always have done. So, Moore is
putting first his political disagreement with Bush's party, instead of
truth. I don't like that. If Moore were had been right about this,
Obama's government would be a lot better, and it's actually worst than
Bush's administration. Despite that, i liked this documentary, and
there's a very funny scene of the movie, that pictures a retired old
man, and how he is denounced by his partners for not being agree with
the government, that, my friends, reflects how us citizens are living
in a fascist regime, not barely close to a democratic nation.

To anyone who truly understands what it means to be an American,
Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 should be seen as a triumph of
patriotic freedom. Rarely has the First Amendment been exercised with
such fervor and forthrightness of purpose: After subjecting himself to
charges of factual errors in his gun-lobby exposé Bowling for
Columbine, Moore armed himself with a platoon of reputable
fact-checkers, an abundance of indisputable film and video footage, and
his own ironically comedic sense of righteous indignation, with the
singular intention of toppling the war-ravaged administration of
President George W. Bush. It's the Bush presidency that Moore, with his
provocative array of facts and figures, blames for corporate
corruption, senseless death, unnecessary war, and political favoritism
toward Osama Bin Laden's family and Saudi oil partners following the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Moore's incendiary film earned
Palme d'Or honors at Cannes and a predictable legion of detractors, but
do yourself a favor: Ignore those who condemn the film without seeing
it, and let the facts speak for themselves. By honoring American
soldiers and the victims of 9/11 while condemning Bush's rationale for
war in Iraq, Fahrenheit 9/11 may actually succeed in turning the tides
of history.

There are only few things i can say about this documentary!When i was
gonna watch it i was wondering what can Michael use for this movie an
that we don't know it?All you need to do is to watch this documentary
and you will find it out...Its apsolutelly great.It really makes you
wonder *who is the real terrorist*!?No one cant say that everything
told in this movie is apsolutelly correct because its not,but the most
important figures in Bushes so called career as a president of the USA
is!In this movie-documentary you can actually see his incapability for
making desicions on his own.There is more then one scene in this
documentary when George W. Bush was by his self without his advisers to
tell him what to do! There are few scenes that are not conected only on
Bush but on every politician liberal or republican...like when he goes
to senators that are cheering for this war and when he asks them will
they sent their child to war and when they start running from him...
You don't have to hate Bush to watch this documentary,its interesting
anyway!

i loved the movie. it confirmed a lot of what i already suspected. it
also shocked me with some of it's graphic scenes; but a good shock.
most of the scenes never made it to American television, although if
they had, more people would be protesting the war. the interviews with
the soldiers were especially enlightening. and i loved the scenes
showing bush's absolute idiocy and clueless expressions. i agree with
michael moore's opinions in this film and think everyone, whether
you're republican or democrat, supporter or critic of the war, should
see this film!!! i was also surprised at how full the theatre was, since
this is a republican town, and not all that large, either. in fact, i'm
surprised that the movie made it to this theatre this soon at all. we
usually get them a long time after they've been released. all in all,
it's a must see movie!

Whether you agree with Michael Moore or not, he's certainly created
conversations. Everywhere I go, I hear people talking about Farenheit
9/11, and it's undeniably a good thing that people are discussing these
issues. There are elements of Moore's film that I agree with and there
are other sections that go a little overboard.At his best, Moore is a brilliant activist. The scene where he reads
the Patriot Act to members of Congress from an ice cream truck is
hilarious and raises an excellent point about the ignorance of our
elected officials. Moore has always had a knack for using humor to get
serious points across, and Farenheit is no exception. There the clip of
the Bush team as the cast of bonanza, an info-graphic about our
coalition of the willing, and those priceless Bush video clips ("I call
upon all nations...now watch me hit this drive."). In another clip,
Moore uses a single guitar riff from Eric Clapton's song Cocaine behind
a graphic of Bush's censored National Guard record. About half the
people in the theater I was in caught the reference.At his worst, Moore is a liberal equivalent to Rush Limbuagh,
egotistical and obnoxious. Many of his ideas are far-fetched and poorly
supported, like the section on the Afghani natural gas pipeline. Fuel
is certainly not the only reason that America has gone to war twice in
the last three years, though it is more of a factor than the right
would have us believe. It's hard to imagine Bush and his cronies caring
about Iraq if it wasn't situated above an ocean of black gold. However,
I would reject that the failed natural gas pipeline in Afghanistan had
anything to do with the decision to go to war. Another poorly executed
point is Moore's attempt to discredit Bush's initial reaction to the
second plane hitting the trade center. Bush can hardly be blamed for
having a blank expression on his face for 7 minutes. I was a little
confused that morning, too.Another point that Moore could've explored further is the Saudi
connection. Saudi Arabia seems to be the home to most of these Al Qaida
operatives, yet we give their government a free pass. What happened to
going after "countries that harbor terrorists?" The official US stance
on Saudi Arabia is that they are a friendly government that simply
cannot control the terrorists within their own borders. Since when is
this an excuse? We refuse to recognize Palestine for that exact reason!
I was shocked to see that the Saudi embassy is protected by Bush's
secret service.American ignorance and blind support of Israel in the Israel-Palestine
conflict is largely at the root of Muslim anger toward us, yet Bush has
NEVER mentioned this as a motive. The current Israeli government is as
frighteningly right wing and war-mongering as our own, but the American
right will blindly support Israel no matter how many innocent people
they slaughter because the religious right has a psychotic Christian
Zionist end-of-the-world fantasy. This is perhaps too complex (and too
controversial) a topic for Moore to tackle, but it is definitely an
important link that MUST be discussed. Our military bases in Saudi
Arabia were also a motive for the hijackers, but Bush has never
mentioned those either. Instead, he claims that we were attacked on
9/11 only because the terrorists "hate freedom." Think rationally for a
minute. When has any human ever killed another human for "hating
freedom?" It just doesn't make sense. Al Qaida is fighting a Jihad
against us. Nowhere in the Quran does it direct Jihadists to "attack
free people."Another point that Moore never makes is the inherent absurdity of the
phrase "War on Terror." We are about as likely to defeat terror as we
are to defeat "fear" or "jealousy." The correct move would have been to
specifically declare war against Al Qaida back in September of 2001. We
were attacked by Al Qaida. They are the enemy, and it's too bad that
BOTH presidential candidates insist on fighting a broader, unwinnable
battle against "terror." I don't believe that anyone in Washington even
knows the correct definition of "terrorist" anymore. The insurgents in
Iraq, for instance, are not terrorists; they are guerrillas. Big
difference. Unfortunately, Bush insists on painting his war with broad
strokes, because that way he can fit just about anyone under the banner
of "terrorist." They might as well just call it the "War on Bad Guys."Go see Farenheit 9/11. Laugh. Cry. Get p***ed. Argue about it
afterwords. It's healthy for Americans to be engaging in political
discussion.I give Moore a 10/10 just for having the guts to make this movie.
Despite what other viewers are writing, he definitely doesn't hate
America; his hate is reserved for the Bush administration, and
criticizing the president is quite different from hating America.
Despite what right-wingers say about Moore, he is passionate about
bringing change to his country. It is both ignorant and stupid to
suggest that anyone who dislikes the president hates his country. On
the contrary, we're showing how much we love America by exercising free
speech and trying to cure the neoconservative Mad Cowboy Disease that
has infected Washington.

I had my doubts about this film going in but coming out I was genuinely
shaken 
and moved to tears.  I learned things I had not known and it changed myperception.  The manner in which the film is constructed is
brilliant--funny, 
moving, and so unexpectedly powerful it's like getting a kidney punch from
your 
best friend.  It's success is rightly deserved.  Michael Moore is a daring,
fearless 
artist and that's what great art is all about--to challenge, conflict,

illuminate--precisely what this film accomplishes.

Whether you hate him or like him, every true American must see Michael
Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. If nothing else this film will get you
thinking about our country good or bad, loving it or hating it. Isn't
that what the arts are designed to do? The goal of every artist is to
move the viewer and listener. Greek playwrights did that first and they
did it well. See this film, discuss it, then make up your own mind,
don't listen to someone else's opinions, beliefs, or ideas. Too many
Americans today do not think for themselves instead that will follow
someone else. We have become a nation of followers. Where have all the
Independents gone? Think for yourself, if you dare.

Fahrenheit 9/11 discusses the events surrounding the worst tragedy in US
history since the Kennedy assassination.  It's main target, if you haven't
already heard, is the Bush administration.  It's scathing in it's
indictments yet they are often hilarious.  Though much is discussed, no real
conclusions are met which leaves a lot for the viewer to ponder.  I honestly
felt bombarded by the information, and it certainly will earn a spot on my
shelf when it arrives on DVD.  (Let's hope it will hit the shelves before
the critical date of November 2, 2004, right?)  This is a film that I feel
cannot be taken whole-heartedly, though there is an astute element of
believability to what it touches base on.  This is a film that must be
studied, discussed and viewed several times.  It certainly is great, and
highly recommended for anyone who doesn't take what the media says at face
value.  Certainly one of the most politically controversial films since
Oliver Stone's JFK.  10 out 10.

As one of the few that's had an opportunity to view a screening of the
film I'm amazed by the current tally of over 1,600 votes  there
haven't been that many screenings as of June 19th ! That said, I'm very
glad that I did have the chance to see this film  some of the imagery
is very strong and disturbing but it is an important film. It's
unfortunate that many of the people that have opinions relating to
topics discussed in this film will either not see Fahrenheit or will
adamantly refuse to let their opinions be swayed by the facts. I've
already had several discussions with friends extremely opposed to the
film  regardless of them not seeing it. This is a time where Michael
Moore steps back from being the centerpiece of the film and lets the
material speak for itself. Most of the material is already in the
public record however, it seems to have less impact when we hear bits
and pieces of information in the newspapers or TV over the years than
when those bits and pieces are put together to tell the story.There are a few times where Mr. Moore may have gone a bit over the top
but this is not supposed to be a school textbook - this is a
combination of documentary and some comedy. When dealing with this
subject matter you really need some comic relief to break the tension
and there is tension. I gave this film a 9 out of 10  you may not
agree with everything but it is a worthwhile way to spend two hours of
your life!

Fahrenheit 9/11 opens not unlike Moore's earlier films, but deals with
something much more macrocosmic in nature. Moore, as narrator, offers
banter and irony, and periodically emerges on screen as a purposeful
irritant, such as when he brings along a Marine who declined to rotate
again to Iraq and together, they call the bluffs of congressmen,
advising them to have their children enlist. And he makes effective use
of frank clips like Bush rehearsing looks on his face before going live
with his broadcast to the nation about 9/11. Why in a time when we have
a level-headed president with essentially logical reasons for expanding
government power do his vehement opponents forget the PATRIOT Act they
supported? Moore discovers that members of Congress don't read most
bills they vote on, including said bill which among other things
involved government infiltration of pacifist groups. And so---possibly
my favorite moment---Moore drives through Washington in an ice cream
truck using the speaker to read the bill to them.Fahrenheit 9/11 is less a revelation about Bush than a melodrama of his
futile, alarming presidency. Its indictments shouldn't be news to
anyone, but either way Moore delineates them with striking footage and
an unremitting voice-over narration that basically reasons that Bush is
(thankfully was) inept, lying, fraudulent, failing in the war on
terrorism, has poor preference of friends. While Moore's voice-over
modulates from indignation to cynicism, some incisive visual sections
speak for themselves. Moore serves a new jolt with well-acquainted
information. It's how he organizes his imagery. We're all acquainted
with the 2000 election dispute, which was "resolved" by the Supreme
Court. What I hadn't seen before was footage of Bush's election
confirmation by Congress. 10 representatives stand to object to it; not
one senator. As we watch the dissenters, we can't help observing that
they're nine black people, one Asian woman. They're all gaveled into
silence by the chairman, Vice President Al Gore. The scene's
desperation and hopelessness reignites old agitations for those who
know Bush was counterfeit.He is depicted as much indebted to friends who've bailed him out of
business risks. Moore chronicles a longstanding affiliation between the
Bush family and important Saudi Arabians. A billion-plus in Saudi money
has passed into the treasure chests of Bush family endeavors. After
9/11 the White House hand-walked flights out of the country
transporting bin Laden family members (which disavow its most widely
known member). Moore looks at military records released by Bush to
elucidate his desertion of the Texas Air National Guard, and discovers
that the name of another pilot's been censored. This pilot, we find,
was Bush's friend who became Texas money manager for the billionaire
bin Ladens. Another clue to the bond between the Bushes and the Saudis:
The law firm of Bush 41's Secretary of State was enlisted by the Saudis
to defend a suit by a group of 9/11 survivors, who charged that the
Saudis had bankrolled al-Qaeda.To Moore, this is more proof of Bush's demoralizing alliance with the
Saudis, that it may've affected his choice to go to war against Iraq to
some degree on their account. Moore finds the war groundless. No WMDs,
no Hussein-bin Laden connection. He speaks with American soldiers,
including amputees, who grieve indignantly about Bush's proposed
military cuts simultaneously as he was sending them into a groundless
war. Moore also interviews American troops who are evidently relishing
the war. He has footage of soldiers who hood an Iraqi prisoner, call
him "Ali Baba" and touch his penis.The Bush administration didn't seem to know what every newscaster
knows, that a satellite image can be live before they get the cue to
speak. That clarifies the disgusting footage of Wolfowitz wetting his
comb in his mouth before slicking back his hair. Comb doesn't do the
trick, so he spits in his hand, wipes it down. And naturally the
immortal "fool me twice" clip. Such scenes catch our targets unawares,
which is classic Moore. However his film gets gradually bleaker. He
predominantly vanishes, concentrating on people such as an enormously
patriotic wife/mother from his hometown of Flint. She reads a letter
from her son, written days before he was killed in Iraq, begging his
family to strive for Bush's impeachment.This, the highest-grossing documentary of all time, is indeed an
imperative, effective film, defiant of the White House aim, which was
to exhibit Bush as a determined commander. He's exposed as a
superficial, incoherent man, childish in speech, phony in demeanor. Not
quite as broad-scale as Bowling for Columbine, Moore moderates his
typical profusion. Tackling bigger risks, he's more gingerly here. We
get an editorial, not a shtick. The anger and bewilderment in his film
are a breathtaking reply to Bush's uninflected reverberation of the
same intractable soundbites. Which one's lost more ground over time,
and which one's gained more? Also, which made sense at the time?

No, I don't immediately believe what Moore puts forth as the truth; I
realize that he, as anyone who makes documentaries(yes, there are
degrees to it, but do you honestly think that any human being can
completely turn off their own opinion, even for enough time to assemble
a piece of journalism?) does, has an agenda. There are those that would
call his work outright propaganda, and to an extent, that's probably
true. However, rather than accept anyone's clear-cut definition of
what's right and what's wrong, let's each of us, as individuals, for
ourselves answer the question: Is that OK, given that he's attempting
to get us to take action for what he considers to be right, as opposed
to trying to justify, say, the mass murder of an entire people or
several? I have watched most of his feature-length productions(save for
Sicko as well as Roger & Me, both of which I'm on the lookout for), and
only an excerpt of Stupid White Men, and just as in that and Bowling
for Columbine, this does try to evoke more of what I imagine is called
"white guilt", and "was that what it was really about" remains his
favorite phrasing. With that said, he makes numerous compelling points,
and as always, that is what I hope people will manage to take from
this; the facts and conclusions that, regardless of how you look at
them, should not be ignored. I'd say that this is his best film yet.
The editing is spot-on, it's dramatic, it's entertaining, it's
gripping. There is a bit of disturbing, violent and unsettling footage,
as well as brief and infrequent strong language in this. The DVD
contains a trailer. I recommend this to anyone who can see themselves
being critical viewers, and not take everything at face value. 10/10

If we were to see one movie this year, or suggest that other's not miss one,
this is the film.  Without a doubt, the movie was directed, created,
envisioned, by Moore.  His influence is felt throughout the film.  But, be a
liberal, a political moderate, or an extreme conservative, Moore brings many
questionable events to light.  He also had the courage to show the misery,
the pain, the fear faced by our troops abroad.  From the scene when our
armies were rushing to Bagdad full of bravado, to the scenes where the many
terribly wounded were questioning why, to the scene of draped coffins, all
enlightening, sad, and if I may say so as a veteran, disgusting.  The young
soldier that faces prison instead of returning to the front, the discussion
with the soldier, a one-time strong Republican, on his way home (full of
morphine), to convince his neighbors to vote Democrat are worth the price of
admission alone.  The scenes of our President, his reaction when first
hearing of the disaster of 9/11 are appalling.  More than anything, this
movie made us wish that our country, our world, return to the days (Greece,
Troy, Rome) when our brave leaders led the charge.  I would truly love to
see how they match up to the poor soldiers that they've placed in harms way.
 We left in tears.

A very touching film. It reminds me of the bureaucracy I had to go through
to close my bank account. (that took two years) Michael Moore lays out
situation after situation of incredible footage, commentary, interviews
which completely paint a picture of how a poorly run situation sprouts into
more and more bad situations for the wrong reasons. The footage speaks for
itself. There isn't that much of the guerrila interviewing from his past
films. (Although he does that with members of congress for fun to ask them
to enlist their kids in the army) The footage...which we've all seen in one
form of another on TV and in the paper...is just amazing. To sit through
this in well-ordered fashion. Reminds how blatant a horror it was that this
country has suffered under incompetence.

This was OK, but I can't believe people were talking about it for best
picture. Moore's Columbine and Roger and Me were better. This film was
just made so Moore could show case his political beliefs. Namely
liberals good - republicans bad and evil. Moore spends time telling us
how the Bush family is involved with Saudis and how Saudis fund
terrorists. He comments on how it can be so hard to find Bin Ladin and
says how the Bush regime lied to start a war in Iraq in order to gain
control of oil rather than find nuclear weapons. It's fine for Moore to
vent his political beliefs, but don't expect everyone to believe them.
And please take everything shown in this with a grain of salt because
it's all biased.FINAL VERDICT: See it if you must since it got so much hype. But
Bowling for Columbine was more informative and entertaining.

Hmm, just viewed this movie, I expected something (I don't know)
more....It all seemed a little like Axe grinding to me. I was hoping
for something more thought provoking. However, There are many moving
images to this film and some excellent points are made. I was sympathetic for the grieving mother of the American Soldier, but
my heart ached for the distraught Iraqi woman who lost everything, she
reminded me of my Italian Grandmother. I learned something from
"Bowling for Columbine" and was hoping to learn more from this film,
but basically I walked away with: ** War is awful ** Terrorism is worse
** Iraq was not responsible for 9/11 ** Our Government wants us to be
fearful ** George W. is rich, (VERY RICH) ** He doesn't want you to
know it ** He got that way with help from the Saudis ** Poor Black Men
in Housing Projects are "prime candidates" for recruitment, while rich
Congressmen/women sons and daughters are notthe problem is...I KNEW ALL OF THIS BEFORE WATCHING the people that
don't know this or choose not to know this won't rent it anyway.

As an outsider, I have to say that Fahrenheit 9/11 was a big dissapointment,
maybe people in 
general don't read the papers or try to get a balanced view on world events,
but as probably 
more has been written about 9/11 than anything else, there was nothing in
this film that was 
new, or even more damning and dissapointing, that was answered.I'm afraid that like "The Passion of the Christ" this film will be reviewed,
as hard as some may 
try, based on in this case, one's political leanings, rather than any of
it's other merits.It did start off well, the titles rolling up 12 minutes into the film's
opening conspiracy 
theories were amazing, and somehow the fact that it took 4 odd minutes to
display a few 
names was irrelevant as before us the promise of seeing behind the "show"
was laid.Ultimately what was the outcome? That the war in Iraq wasn't neccessary? I
was hoping 
maybe for some insight into why THEY duped us (money?), or whether, THEYwere duped themselves, but the film hardly bothered to tell us that WMD
haven't been found 
etc, instead concentrating unfairly in my opinion on the terrible grief of
one women after the 
oh-to-recent loss of her Son in Iraq, and that (horror of horrors) the army
is mostly made up 
of people from the poorer parts of society, which I'm sure you'll find it
true of most civil 
servant jobs all over the world.Where's the controversy in that?And I found it quite ironic that when the army first came into it, they were
shown as mindless 
thugs, listening to music, as they killed innocent people etc, yet in the
end the director used 
their meaningless deaths as the main collateral (closing point) in his
argument.In the end I ended up paying to watch one person's biased political message
and I'm no 
particular fan of "Dubya" myself

Michael Moore is a self-admitted propagandist.  He's the Leni Riefenstal of
the smug liberals.  
He's got something to say and the vehicle with which to say it.  I'm not
questioning his right 
to a political opinion, I'm not doubting his sincerity in getting his
message heard.  My beef is 
with Michael Moore the filmmaker, Michael Moore the documentarian.  This
film (as a film not 
a political statement or message) is a terrible film.  It's a good half hour
too long.  It's use of 
funny little nods to the TV generations savvy (Bonanza) is insulting not
only to the people 
who are profiled in the film but also to those watching it.  But you know
something?  I could 
get over all that if he didn't consistently take the low road and mock the
very people he's 
profiling.  (I'm not talking about the Bush administration here--I'm talking
about the ordinary 
people like Lila Lipscomb and the soldiers he interviews).  He did it in
Roger and Me, I'm sure 
he did it in Bowling for Columbine (I couldn't bear to watch that one), and
he does it again 
here.  He acts like he is much smarter, cooler and "in the know" than the
people he's 
speaking to and he edits the living daylights out of his footage to make
them all look like 
idiots.  If he is trying to make the point that the poor, disenfranchised
youth of America are 
fighting the war for the big, bad politicians (and believe you me, that is
one of his points), 
then he would be much better served if he didn't make fun of them by editing
their words 
thematically.  Let me explain.  He thinks it's amusing to interview soliders
and ask them what 
music they listen to when they're "working".  He then uses these clips
strung together to 
paint a very unflattering picture of the very soldiers he asks you to feel
sorry for a half an 
hour later in the film.  The soldiers may very well be pawns in the
industrial military complex.  
Does that mean they have to be pawns in a Michael Moore film, too? It is very unfortunate that this film will line the pockets of Michael Moore
and even more 
unfortunate that people will be swayed by its themes into thinking it's a
good film.  Come 
awards season, we'll no doubt have to see Mr. Moore's large, disheveled self
pontificating 
from on high.  I'm thinking of taking a trip to Saudi Arabia around the end
of February just so 
I don't have to watch.

My opinions about this movie are very similar to my opinions about
Moore's "Bowling for Columbine." Moore strings together a lot of
interviews and images, but I don't think they come together into a
satisfying whole. We already know about most of the things he
discusses, so it's not like we are going to learn anything new. This is
basically just a documentary that says Moore is against the war--well,
so what? Documentaries should try to have some semblance of
objectivity, but there isn't much here. He basically set out to make
Bush look bad (not like Bush needs any help from anyone to make him
look bad, but still...). The documentary is too scattered for us to
really know what he is trying to say, other than that war sucks and
Bush is a moron--both obvious points (to me at least).

Okay, its been almost a year since this movie hit theaters and caused
nationwide pandemonium. People LOVED it and people HATED it. It's not
easy to think objectively about a film that interferes so much with
one's political beliefs. Sure, the film is biased and manipulative but
so are countless other documentaries. Why does'nt every other
documentary film get the same kind of scrutiny? Again, it comes down to
politics. People are very opinionated when it comes to politics and
especially now after the wake of September 11, the country is more
divided then ever. Michael Moore is not ready to persuade Bush
supporters to agree with his film. His goal was simple: to make a film,
have it released before the election and make sure that it would shock,
entertain and motivate people to vote. If Michael Moore tried to make
an objective view of the president's involvement in the September 11th
attacks, the film would have been about five hours long, it would'nt be
as entertaining, not many people would see it, and it would not have
been ready to hit theaters by last year's election. So it's obvious
that Michael Moore wanted to vote Bush out of office. according to
Moore, half of the country, particularly the youth, was still not
voting and he wanted to change that. And he did. 2004 proved to be one
of the biggest if not, THE biggest voter turn out in the history of the
USA but Moore's wish did not entirely come true because George W. Bush
won the second term as president of the USA. Did Fahrenheit 911 have
anything to do with it? Did this film do more harm to the Democrats
then good? My sorry answer is yes and no.We live in a media frenzied culture where Hollywood gets more attention
then the news. Michael Moore was asked harder questions about
Fahrenheit 9/11 then the president was ever asked about the war in
Iraq. So while a big fat left wing clown makes a harsh and ruthless
attack on the president, the media on the other hand, is quietly
following business as usual by ignoring investigations, ignoring hard
questions and feeding us war clips as seen through the eyes of the US
military: "Operation Iraqi Freedom". We need people like Michael Moore
to wake up those of us who don't look beyond the corporate media of
America for their news. The problem is, we also should'nt be lectured
about it with such emotional attacking insults and that is the
inevitable problem of this film.

I waited a long time to finally go see this movie, and found it lacking
in a number of ways. It would have been much more effecitive if Moore
had left his personal dislike of Bush, and focused on the broader
issues. Also, he needed a morefocused thesis for this movie. I felt like I was following a moving
target - I knew I was supposed to be upset about something, but what
exactly? Bush stealingthe election? The Bushes being friendly with the Saudis? Bush using theevents of 9/11 as cover for his evil agenda involving invading Iraq? It
needed some editing the sharpen the message and film clips. Some clips
were just too long, and too pointless. I felt like I should have been
outraged by the film, but I was actually a bit bored. I rate it about 3
or 4 out of 10. And no, I've never been a big Bush fan and won't be
voting for him in November.

I am giving this film a three because it has some credits when it comes
to the techniques used and the introduction of some "humouristic"
sequences... but when it comes to the real content, I believe they have
twisted the reality so much that made the argument absurd. Had it been
neutral and objective, perhaps I could have really enjoyed it. For
example, I think it is offensive to the locals the way they paint pre
war Iraq, as if it had been a paradise of harmony and peace. Actually
this film has nothing to do with reality... Another tasteless segment
deals with this very patriotic American mother who lost her son in Iraq
and out of grief starts to hate the president and to condemn the US
action. Please... nobody likes wars, but defense is something
different.

After watching Michael Moore's latest work I decided to surf the web so
as to verify the veracity of the statements and images of this film.It has always amazed me how much analysis and dissection goes into each
frase that is uttered by Michael Moore. I am a long-time fan, ever
since Roger and Me, and have always approached his works with a sense
of humour, watching them as tongue-in-cheek "mockumentaries", not as
objective, scientific fact-filled and full-researched serious
documentary work. To me it's just another form of entertainment. Above
all Michael likes to provoke, to highlight issues and people he does
not particularly sympathies with. His populist, slightly opportunistic
approach may not be to everyone's intellectual and rational liking but
underneath all this provocation he is ranting and raving on about many
serious and pertinent problems.He throws mud around in the hope that some of it will stick. It's his
favoured method of research, after all one cannot expect the full
collaboration of the subjects or the issues he is going after. We have
tabloid newspapers, tabloid TV and now tabloid documentaries- At least
Michael makes tabloid look respectable.

Having seen Michael Moore's profoundly ANTI-war documentary Fahrenheit
9/11, I was greatly surprised and disappointed to hear his comments on
talkshows recently repudiating Ralph Nader and his candidacy. This is
all the more surprising since Moore was a strong supporter of Nader's
in his past two runs for president (although, Moore now says he
supported Nader only under certain conditions, namely that he wouldn't
have a real chance of actually being elected).Moore now supports the PRO-war John Kerry. Kerry, of course, not only
voted yes on the war as a member of the senate, but he also favors the
continued occupation of Iraq by US soldiers. Perhaps, Moore is now
choosing to go the lesser-of-two-evils route. However, if his anti-war
stance was as serious as Fahrenheit 9/11 would seem to indicate, he
should be behind Ralph Nader - the only ANTI-war candidate of the three
- instead of making the lesser-of-two-evils compromise and supporting
the PRO-war John Kerry.

Michael Moore's films can be entertaining. He likes to use stock
footage and silly music to make his points, and he's a funny guy. You
can't help but laugh at what he has to say sometimes. But I wouldn't
trust any of his "fact based" films any farther than I could throw his
orca-sized frame. You can't take a word he says at face value; you have
to analyze his films, not watch them, to see where the fiction begins
(usually in the first frame) and the fact ends. It's difficult
reconciling Moore condescending tone with his claims to be the voice of
the common man. Fahrenheit 911 begins with a sardonic diatribe that
Moore makes sound as if every American is naive about his government,
and he puts in details without, well, details. For instance, a big
point in his Bush-has-ties-to-the-Bin-Laden-family rant is that "a half
brother" of Osama had some contact with a colleague of Bush's a number
of years ago. Half-brother, wow -- pretty close, huh? Well, it might
be... only Moore forgets to mention that there are FIFTY FOUR Bin Laden
brothers and sisters. (This is a SAUDI family, not the Cleavers.)
That's more siblings than the total relatives in MY family, most of
whom I barely know. I can hardly imagine that, if one of them committed
a murder, MY relationships would instantly become suspect. Most of the
connections that Moore portrays as the essence of obvious corruption
are, to a well-informed viewer like me (I didn't vote for Bush in 2000
and won't in 2004), completely unpersuasive. Moore then portrays Marine
recruiters are somehow evil in their use of (effective) recruiting
techniques. ("You wanna be am athlete? David Robinson was in the
service before the NBA... Did you know Shaggy got his start playing in
the Marine Corps band?") Are we supposed to blame the GOP for the
service trying to get people to sign up? Isn't that their job? If this
weren't wartime, would Moore have any problem with it? Moore correctly
points out that the Bush Administration did not allow flag-draped
coffins to be photographed (a horrible decision), then
self-aggrandizingly says that the media have completely ignored the
stories of the wounded and killed soldiers. (I listen to NPR every day,
and they are ALWAYS telling the human-interest profiles of fallen
soldiers.) How is it that, somehow, the White House flaks getting their
make-up applied before going on-air is portrayed as vain and shallow
(is Moore saying that none of his sympathetic interviewees primped a
little before going on camera)? I have a feeling that, if a Republican
were to use images from 9/11 in a movie which celebrated Bush's
leadership skills, Moore would be the first to call it exploitation.
How does his bald use of such things equate to "noble" propaganda? The
movie is so deeply flawed (not in its politics so much as its
structure) that any educated person with access to Google could debunk
virtually every claim made, or at least point out Moore's grave
omissions and mischaracterizations. As entertainment, maybe this is a
B; as a "documentary," probably a D.

I admit it - I walked out on this film. Not because I'm a raving Bush
supporter - I'm not! I walked out because after a very strong start, this
film just degenerated into what I guess was supposed to be meaningful
footage which I guess was to get us thinking. But it dribbled on endless and
was so poorly edited that after about an hour, I didn't know where the
documentary was going anymore, didn't know why I was watching it and how it
could possibly end. It should have ended with the Corporal saying he would
rather go to jail then go back to Iraq - and then he gave his reasons. And
the film hung there for a precious second - I thought this is it... Let it
go right here and AGH! No, Moore went on. After what felt like 15 minutes or
more, I left. This was going no where.I felt (unlike many reviews I've read) that the film was much stronger in
its portrayal of Bush and his family's connections and hopefully, opens the
eyes of Americans to what many have seen overseas. Our press didn't stay as
biased as long as it did in the US and it was soooooooo obvious what Bush
and his administration were doing (except to politicians). I'm glad a lot of
that came out (although how come the more 'powerful' countries like
Australia and the UK weren't mentioned in his list of the "coalition of the
willing???" I mean Mr Moore, we already know your film is biased, but you
don't leave out vital facts like that!). I just hope Moore's message wasn't
lost in the endlessly dribbling over Iraq. Maybe the other reviews were
trying to be tacftul and say "if the Iraq bit had been edited as well as the
first half, this one have been on scorching documentary that would have hit
a home run with voters..." But if I was an American, I don't know if it
would change my vote or not. Because I had to leave because Moore missed the
right point to end his documentary.

While Michael Moore can be very clever in his selections, editing, and
juxtapositions, what results in "Fahrenheit 9/11" is not the startling
sublimity of "Bowling for Columbine" or even the comedic pathos of
"Roger and Me." Instead, F911 is nothing more than a shrill diatribe
against the Bush administration. Leave aside the politics (which almost
none do), judge the movie not as a Republican or a Democrat, but rather
as film. Compare F911 to other such movies--"Triumph des Willens" comes
to mind--compare it even to Moore's other films, and it comes up short,
way short; so short that one is left with to think a sophomore (or
sophomoric) film student had created it. Moore should step down from
the Olympic heights his speech at the Oscars exalted him to and become,
strange though it sounds, less passionate. He has lost his touch to
make the really fine documentary; perhaps he could review a few of Leni
Riefenstahl's films for inspiration. 6/10.

The best thing about this movie is the title and the tagline. I'm a
HUGE fan of Moore's work in film and television. However, I was bored
watching this movie. Even if you are part of that « I new it! » crowd,
the fact is this movie has too much chatter about stuff you already
know about (the war was last year!). I think that might be the main
problem with this movie. I learned stuff in Roger and Me and the way
better Bowling for Columbine. But I actually feel I know more about the
subject of Fahrenheit 911 than Moore does! This might explain why there
are already so many posts to this site criticizing the film. Moore was
trying to create controversy. On purpose. If he was trying to convince
people to vote Democrat, I think he failed miserably. If you're going
to make a one sided propaganda movie, make it about something people
don't know about. Flint Michigan for example. Iraq? The Florida
recount? Come on. Most people know, for example, that the coalition of
the willing included the UK, Australia, Japan and Spain. Not just
Iceland, Romania and the like as Moore implies. The US didn't go alone
into Iraq. Granted, it wasn't « the mother of all coalitions » that the
Secretary of Defence advertised. But Moore didn't need to bend the
truth to make him look foolish. We all know painfully well what
happened in Florida. I personally didn't need the reminder. This movie
would have made a great 60 minute TV opinion piece on the Documentary
Channel. Instead, it's stretched out to two hours and will have you
looking at your watch. I recommend watching this movie when it comes
out on TV. But only if you record it first so you can fast forward the
boring parts.

The leftist political context of the movie overshadows any credibility of
facts it might have; Michael Moore is a typical narrow-minded liberal who
doesn't seem to understand that anti-American terrorists and regimes don't
distinguish between republicans or democrats, neither do they distinguish
between who is a president - that was proven on 9/11/2001 - all the
terrorists want to do is kill us all. So engaging in anti-governmental
propaganda as such in the time of today's turmoil is treason - treason of
America - and anyone who watches or endorses this movie is a traitor of USA.
Fictitious fabrications, cheesy montages, and fake interviews should make
any normal person sick and filled with anger this "documentary"0/10

I loved Bowling for Columbine. It was fascinating, entertaining, funny,
and intelligent. This is none of those, and really not even a good
film. First of all, where is Michael Moore going with this? Most
documentaries of this nature will propose a question and set out to
determine answers, that being the filmmakers' purpose. I can't tell
what direction Moore is trying to go with this, or what ground he is
trying to break. It's like, yeah Bush isn't going to go down in history
as the greatest president, everyone know's that. But here, Moore
practically begs you to hate Bush. It is such obvious propaganda. And
Moore's followers are blind to anything other than what he says. It's
like he's some God that taught them how to think or something. This
film made me lose respect for him. Like I said, I loved Bowling for
Columbine. This on the other hand was sad, bland, and surprisingly
boring. I honestly checked my watch like four times.

I know that I slammed this movie earlier without having gone to see
it..... I decided to buy a copy to see what the fuss was about.....It
amounted to be nothing other than a 2 hour media circus.... I was
basically unimpressed, I didn't say totally unimpressed.... There were
quite a few heart rendering moments in F911. There was a woman named
Viola in F911 whose son was killed in Iraq, O M G how heart broken she
was, And Believe me, My HEart goes out to anyone who loses a relative
in a war. You can take my word for that....And I know there are
thousands of Violas all across this Great and Free nation of ours.
Parents who have lost sons (and daughters) in that awful war, And
Afghanistan too.... and there have been wars before... and there will
be wars again. I believe we will win Iraq. A new Government is in place
there and has been in place for several months. The New Iraqi President
has spoken in Washington. I know there are casualties of War. And
Collateral Damage. These are facts of War. And They are terrible.
Nobody wants to lose their child in a war. I hope IMDb.com approves
this re-review of F-911. I am (politically) a Conservative Independent.
I believe we will win the war in Iraq.. Thank you..

***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "Fahrenheit 9/11", a liberal propagandist
machine masquerading as a "documentary", was beyond even my worst
expectations, as I hadn't anticipated even Michael Moore to stoop so
degradingly, intolerably low in his atrocious misrepresentation of
President Bush and the American spirit. Take it from someone who
regularly (O.K. constantly) watches the news and is perhaps the most
politically conscious youth in American today, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is
nothing more than a Bush, American, Capitalistic, and even Militaristic
hate machine, determined to undermine our commander-in-chief, who has
taken pains to serve and protect our country with dignity and strength,
our mean and women serving courageously overseas for our freedom and
security, and our very state of mind. This is a film whose single
purpose is to unseek our president through deception, ridicule, and
fallacy (just listen to The O'Reilly Factor or The Scarborough Country
for evidence of Michael Moore's lies and manipulations which some of
you believe is complete fact). Moore purports that Bush is a feeble,
culpable leader who was uncertain and unprepared during the terrible
attacks on 9/11 (Moore insists here that Bush was lethargic and void of
response in his ridiculous example of Bush simply remaining calm for a
mere seven minutes, when immediately thereafter, Bush commanded the
scene and responded to the terrorist attacks brilliantly, even
reassuring the American spirit that we will prevail and the terrorists
will be brought to justice for their perpetrations). Additionally,
Michael Moore insists that Bush has been futile, disastrous, and even
avaricious in conducting a War on Terrorism. Perhaps the most atrocious
part of the film focuses on a "futile, disastrous" Afghanistan
campaign, resulting in very little but perhaps a worsened civility
there. Absolute nonsense for anybody who has ever even bothered to
listen to the news. Then, he ventures into the Iraq campaign, implying
that "evil American imperialism" has devastated every Iraqi family and
that life was "good and jolly" under the rule of Saddam Hussein and his
brutal, murderous regime. Good one, Mike. Torture chambers, mass
graves, mobile weapons facilities, restriction of worship, abolition of
democracy.. Sounds like a happy place to live, doesn't it, folks? Now
how would you believe such a conception would resonate with the men and
women overseas who strove and succeeded in toppling the Taliban
government, Saddam Hussein's Baath government and Republican Guard, and
captured a vast majority of al Quaida operatives and its associates in
the process? Michael Moore's reasoning of the War on Terror,
transparently a war between good and evil, under absolute, unevidenced
assumption: OIL. Both Bush's had intense ties to our alleged allies the
Saudis, so proceeding 9/11, Bush's one and only objective was to
somehow profit in the Middle Eastern oil industry. Such implications
are outrageous, unevidenced, and completely detrimental to the actual
agenda in the War on Terror: to defeat terrorists and their sponsors
and avert another September 11 from ever occurring again. Furthermore,
this liberal propaganda is about as one-sided as it gets. Take Michael
Moore's interviewees: several congressmen: all Democrats (ZERO
Republicans), and distressed, grieving mothers such as Linda Lipscumb
and her upset son in the military (while neglecting to focus on proud,
confident soldiers (as there are many) who are optimistic about their
endeavors in Iraq and abroad and believe they are serving an ultimately
wonderful purpose). Unfortunately in war, of course there will be
casualties, and of course there will be opposition; this is nothing
new, and it is the assassins who are to blame, not the President of the
United States. These are the same terrorists who would stop at nothing
to see as many American lives extinguished as possible, for they
despise America. Additionally, Michael Moore only focuses on devastated
Iraqi citizens proceeding the War in Iraq, while neglecting to
concentrate on devastated, oppressed citizens during the reign of
Saddam Hussein, or citizens who are eternally grateful for his absence.
Moore neglects to even acknowledge the other side, as such would merely
compromise his thesis: President Bush is to blame for everything wrong
with this country and America is to blame for everything wrong in the
world. Moore asserts that Bush has been a failure, from the grounds of
the 2000 election to the War in Iraq, has merely tarnished the
greatness of America, and has accomplished little or nothing since
9/11. I suppose people like Michael Moore do not see the truth as
clearly as I do, and believe me, folks: "Fahrenheit 9/11" is NOT the
truth. My conclusion of "Fahrenheit 9/11": sometimes daunting (in its
own fallacy), sometimes pathetic (often resorting to ridiculing Bush
and his administration when they are mostly unaware)and always
atrocious (endeavoring to brainwash whatever ignorant or undecided
voter in America into concurring with Michael Moore on subjects which
should be examined objectively and factually. Michael Moore has
assembled a propagandist machine which distorts and extrapolates the
facts through tricky, deceiving editing, bullies Bush and his
administration through mocking their reactions when they are unaware
(as if Michael Moore would exhibit himself attractively in such a
manner), and flat out lies about very critical subjects, such as the
War on Terror, the 2000 election, and the spirit of the American
people. I can only hope and pray that people are not as ignorant as
Michael Moore would like to believes Americans are. Let me exit with
some interesting, reverent Michael Moore patriotism, in quoting the man
behind "Fahrenheit 9/11": "Americans are possibly the dumbest people on
the planet. We don't know anything that's happening outside our
country. Our stupidity is embarrassing..." Well, I certainly know
what's happening inside and outside of America, and as a first-time
voter, I'll make up my own mind this November, Michael Moore.Zero Stars out of Four

Yes this hyped up joke of a movie is the worst documentary ever. A good
documentary has 2 sides of an argument this has one and never even
comes close to delving into the other side. The movie just aims to
attack Bush, often in an unfair manor i feel, and i don't even like Bush
yet i feel he was treated unfairly. The movie is based on assumptions
and little fact, he talks about Bush's links to the Bin Laden family,
links that are very slight and has no proof that his assumptions are
correct. My main problem with this movie is that it sets out to
entertain rather than inform like a good documentary should. I pity any
American who lets this movie sway their vote in the forthcoming
elections, but any person with any sense would not vote democrat just
because of this movie. People with sense will see right through this
movie and the only ones who wont are very anti-bush so would have voted
democrat anyway, or they are just morons who should have their vote
taken away.

Michael Moore, who is sometimes referred to as, "Flint's favorite son,"
is actually quite despised in his hometown & throughout Michigan if for
nothing else, the fact he still gets extortion money from the Flint
unions from his communist newspaper days in the 70s.This "guy for the people," who rides around on the Time Warner plane on
his book tour saying he's just like us & is looking out for us, is
really nothing more than a fatter & even less attractive Barbara
Streisand elitist who to his credit, does inspire wonderful & necessary
debates between the wings. He also gets both sides together to agree
that he is a total pri*k. Now for his resume...First of all, Roger & Me was a fantastic film! Very well done & very
well deserved. Canadian Bacon, while boring for the most part, is fun &
John Candy is sorely missed. To disappoint my fellow pro-gun chums,
this film is not so much anti-gun as it is anti-media. For that part,
this film wasn't bad at all. The bank & the gun fiasco was total
nonsense. That bank does not do that for real, & if it did, you'd have
to wait a week just like everyone else. Moore made it more anti-NRA
than anti-gun, which some would say are interchangeable but you can
distinguish. This film, where do I start? First of all, this film is necessary in
that it reminds us of what we went thru that terrible day. Most
Americans love to sweep all "bad things" under the carpet & get on with
our lives. We are a nation of passive/aggressives that are mad as hell
& hungry for blood after 9/11 wanting to get all the bad guys
(including Saddam) until we talk about actually getting Saddam & then
we suddenly want peace. Another example is films that quickly deleted
the towers from appearing in them & then a brief movement to delete
them from all films so we could pretend they never existed. I applaud Moore for not showing us the towers as they burn & fall &
simply gives us a blackened screen with the sound of a plane crash.
Thank you for that. I think everyone got tired of seeing them collapse.
But the film slowly diverts & then the focus turns to Iraq & then we
get yet another anti-war, anti-Bush, anti-Bush's colleagues flick. The
big misnomer in this flick is a snippet of Bush & his dad playing golf,
supposedly right after 9/11 & Bush making a remark or two on Al Qaeda
before carrying on with his golf game. First off, that interview/golf trip was in August 2002, & second, Bush
was remarking about a recent terrorist attack on Israel by
Palestinians. There are various other pieces of media snippets & such
that are mis-dated or misleading in one way or another.The overall gist of the film however is in fact very necessary. Moore
himself states that the intent is really more to inspire debate than to
convince you that he is all knowing & right. If that IS in fact what he
intends then he is successful. However, Moore's demeanor during his
booktour says to me that he seems to believe himself to be a leftist
version of Bill O' Reilly. Both of these guys are just as
megalomaniacal as our President so they can all just kiss my a**.
Although, O'Reilly's "Those Who Trespass," is awesome so we can keep
him. Can we simply push the rest out of a plane? Can we?

That this film awakens such nasty passions among its opponents already
bespeaks its success as a piece of film-making. And what its opponents
fail to realize is that the reason for this is that, although it makes
no attempt to deny the propagandistic goal of the film, it is the
images and brief interviews that evoke these passions, not what Moore
has to say of them.Although certainly a political film, this film is not a lie, it is not
built on lies. Despite the efforts of the now solidly right-wing media
to bury it, the evidence against Bush and Cheney is there, much of it
(what has not been suppressed) is public record.No matter how you spin it, when Bush first heard of the attack on the
Twin Towers, he sat there reading a kid's book; he had no response to
make - public record.No matter how you spin it, his first response to 911 was to have the
Bin Laden family (to whom he owes several million dollars - public
record) safely removed from Florida - public record.And no matter how you spin it, the Iranian government offered to assist
the US in putting an end to Al Quaeda, and the Bush response was to
declare Iran part of some nebulous "axis of evil" - public record.And no matter how you spin it, Bush warned us of WMD in Iraq that
didn't exist (and he knew it - public record) and Iraqi involvement in
Al Quaeda which he knew to be false - public record.Do the research yourself. Moore's commentary is satiric, even,
sarcastic, but the facts are - public record.Georege Bush needs to be tried for treason and killed - legally, of
course, as all; traitors are.He is not legally the president of the US, I'm sorry; he's a criminal.
He must be impeached, arrested, tried, convicted, sentenced, and hung.In public, like Saddam Hussein.A few months ago, the Homeland Security Department (aka Gestapo) tried
having people arrested for saying that in public; well, they can kiss
my behind - I thrust my mighty American sphincter in their direction
and let loose - thus is my right as a citizen of the US - AS GUARANTEED
IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.Impeach Bush - US out of Iraq NOW! Long Live the Constitution! Long live the United States!

I thought from all the hype this movie would be more entertaining. It
was slower & duller than an insurance seminar. Beyond that, it was
nothing but leftist propaganda released by the usual Hollywood mafia. I
thought it would be much more comical, but because of the slow pace it
was more dull than anything else. Morally speaking this movie showed
many deceitful scenes which were later proved to be so. My personal
favorite was the wounded soldier who was made to be a victim but when
later interviewed he said Moore didn't show the truth, the fact that he
was extremely proud of his service and would do it all again. Thanks
Michael Moore for taking an hour & a half of my life i'll never get

Michal Moore has, once again, come out with a film that gives you many
theories of conspiracies at the highest level of government backed by
refuted facts & a whole plethora of well-masked lies. Many people,
republican & democratic alike, have spoken out against this very
distasteful film, & Michal Moore has said nothing to rebut the facts
brought out against his film. I would recommend this film only as a
drink coaster to left-wingers that think the government has made it
their life's work to lie & deceive you. Anyone who wants the truth
about this film should see Fahrenhype 911 & Celsius 41.11 0/10 [thumb:

to Canada & barged into people's homes?]

I was excited to see this movie and was curious exactly what all the
hub-bub was about. But it was very boring. I actually got up and left
the couch a number of times while watching it because there is not much
to keep you riveted unless you are filled with hate and anger. I now
realize that anything that portrays Bush in a bad light is going to get
lots of hub-bub for just that and that only. There is nothing in this
movie that makes me believe that Bush is a bad person despite the
desperate ploys of goofy Moore. If you hate Bush then this will
reinforce your feelings of hatred, but if you are indifferent to Bush
you will probably find this movie extremely boring. Bowling for
Columbine was more compelling and interesting than this cut and paste
movie that is filled with a desperate need for hatred by the have-nots.

I watched the movie and thought it to be very one sided and miss
leading. President Bush will a wonderful President and did what anyAmerican in his/her right mind would do. I support him completely and
think this is the stupidest movie I have ever wasted my money on. I
will recommend to everyone I know not to rent or buy this trash.
Micheal Moore can express his opinion so can I that is why I live in
the USA... This was a horrible waste of money and time...The film was edited and narrated by some one who doesn't like our
President and I thought we were to stand behind our leaders. Why is it
we pay Senators and Congressman more that the average family makes in a
lifetime and we are against a man who is standing up for us little
people? I firmly believe in President Bush and this movie made me a
firm believer in his ability to lead our country.A FREE American

This was a movie not a documentary. I would recommend people who are
not aware of the issues out there to see this, so that they maybe
caught up, but I would ask for whoever sees it to actually use some
intelligence while viewing it and see that it is complete propaganda.
This movie will show you exactly Michael Moore's opinion on the
political topics today with no room for interpretation, or even
statistical facts to prove them. In fact some of the "views" were being
doctored and that is why people are complaining since Moore doctored
their stuff without permission, such as newspapers. I believe that this
movie did not really establish anything new or open any eyes to
anything that is not in the news. I believe that the only purpose this
movie serves is to help fire people up more who are already fired up
about the situations they already know about.

These are not my words. But they share my feelings on this tripe of a
film:'From Here to Eternity." "Tora, Tora, Tora." "In Harm's Way." These are
three films made about Pearl Harbor. There have been more than 20 films
made about Pearl Harbor, and over 200 films made about World War II.These films inspire patriotism, courage, and nationalism. They tell us
about the honor and bravery of the soldiers and the nation that
supported them. Two and a half years after the attack on Pearl Harbor,
the world watched American forces fight on D-Day. Two and a half years
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the world is watching Michael
Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11."Moore's film is the first major motion picture about Sept. 11, 2001.
This bears repeating. When future generations look back on the Sept. 11
massacre, their first impression, through the medium of film, will be a
work in which the president and the government are blamed for the
attacks, and the soldiers who are protecting this country are defamed.Instead of a film version of Lisa Beamer's book, "Let's Roll," or
Richard Picciotto's "Last Man Down," we are presented with this
fallacy. How could this happen?It would be a colossal insult to insinuate that Franklin D. Roosevelt
or the U.S. government were in any way responsible for the attacks on
Pearl Harbor. Can you imagine the indignation of the men and women who
lived during that period? "Fahrenheit 9/11" is indicative of a nation
that has become too apathetic, ignorant or deceived to face the enemy
at the gate. America, where is your fury?On Sept. 11, 2001, I stood across the Hudson River, watching the Twin
Towers burn, knowing that if the plane had struck at 9:46 a.m. instead
of 8:46 a.m., I would be dead. As a survivor and witness to the attack
on the World Trade Center, I am more than insulted by this film. I am
outraged. This film is based on conjecture, hearsay and propaganda. At
a time when this country desperately needs to rally in support of our
brave soldiers and our strong leaders, Moore is content to spread
discord and divisiveness. The base of his argument is that the Bush
administration had strong ties with the bin Laden family. However,
sound facts are conspicuously absent from this "documentary."The 9/11 commission did not indict President Bush. According to the
report, the president's actions before, during and after the attacks
are fully justified, including the military action in Iraq. The
commission did not find a direct link between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A similar commission in the 1940s would
not have found a direct link between Hitler's Germany and the attack on
Pearl Harbor.In both instances, the threat was imminent; the president and the
military acted decisively. Could we have been more prepared for a
terrorist attack on Sept. 10, 2001? Certainly. Could we have been more
prepared for an attack on Dec. 6, 1941? Most definitely. In the weeks
and months following Pearl Harbor, there were reports and criticisms
that the government and military should have been more prepared. The
difference is that the people of the nation did not waste a lot of time
pointing fingers at each other. Rather, they unified and engaged the
enemy head-on. I guess that is why we call them "The Greatest
Generation." How will future generations refer to us? So, how do we
explain Moore's film to future generations? I wonder. More than that, I
wonder how I would explain this film to Nancy D., Jerome N. or Heather
H. I am sure you don't know their names, but their faces haunt me day
and night. How would I explain to them that a film was made accusing
the president and vilifying the soldiers, the same president and
soldiers who are attempting to avenge their murders and protect other
citizens. Moore has not only insulted the nation, he has insulted the
victims of the terrorist attacks.During his acceptance speech at the Oscars, Moore said, "Shame on you,
Mr. Bush. "Well I say, "Shame on you, Michael Moore." Shame on everyone
who supports his travesty of a film. Shame on a society that allows
this sham of a film. You have weakened the nation.

Obviously, michael Moore is a social misfit.  His serious physical problems
in his life have left him hate filled.  Obviously he aims his false ideas at
other social misfits.  Of course the communist and socialist parties consist
of social misfits and o collection of misinformed, illogical, and angry
thinking people.The once proud and great democratic party of roosevelt has been used as
stomping gound for these socialist thinking people.  They have hijacked the
party of the poor and working class for fringe elements. Now there is not
much of a choice but at least Bush is not socialist.  Nader, of course is
the real hope of the disenfranchised now that the Democrats have turned
hawkish to try and win.Moore is the freakiest of the freaky and has made a film based on every whim
and lie that has floated around.

I'll start of by stating that I am quite liberal. I am only stating
this because people are going to attack my statements by just claiming
that I am a conservative idiot. I know there are some good issues
raised in this film, but it is serious a very poorly put together film.
Michael Moore doesn't ever put out a thesis at the beginning of the
documentary by which to follow, and this is the film's downfall. It
skips around from point to point, but rarely if ever are the points he
raises in the film ever resolved. As a prime example of Moore bringing
to light another tangent that has no relevance whatsoever to terrorism,
Moore proceeds to show more damn footage about Flint Michigan. I'm
sorry but WTF, not everything has to do with Flint and how poor the
people are. I'm pretty sure Michael Moore is from Flint Michigan, and
I'm also pretty sure that Michael Moore is a fine example of how
someone from Flint Michigan can make a large amount of money.At one point Michael makes fun of American soldiers by showing them as
bloodthirsty fools, and then he tries to make you feel bad that they
are dieing. I suppose all of the Bush footage is humorous, but I've
watched the Daily Show before, and thus little of it is actually new.
Also, I know Bush is an fool, but with enough editing and being around
cameras, almost anyone is going to make themselves look incompetent. I
really do question if this film has any lasting relevance. The hardcore
liberals, who are going to the movie just because it's liberal, aren't
really going to learn anything they don't already know. The hardcore
conservatives are going to go to the movie just so they can condemn it.
The rest of the middle are either going to dislike it because they hate
Michael Moore, or not have their opinion changed because it so
extremely to the left. I don't really think that Bowling For Columbine
was that good of a movie, but it was definitely better than Fahrenheit
911. At least it stays on track most of the time, and seems to have a
conclusion (as shitty as of a conclusion as it may be). If you want to
see a good Michael Moore documentary, watch Roger & Me, otherwise you
are just wasting your money to say that you more liberal than your
friends.

Propaganda such as this should be treated as such. Very few facts were
presented unskewed. Waste of time, money, and resources in the making
and viewing of such garbage. Never in the history of our great nation
has such treason been regarded as artistic. It's a slap in the faces of
the son's and daughters of our country. Treason is treason Mr. Moore!
It's a sad day to know that you can say this is freedom of speech and
artistic liberty when it's clear the side you back doesn't believe in
such rights. Anyone who holds this movie to be truthful and factual

Watch this only if you enjoy semi-truths, ABC news, Tom Brokaw and

cartoons where they edit a speech or conversation to fit an entirely
new "script"? This is what Michael is all about. BTW, ask him about the
corporate jet and accommodations he accepts from the "bad guys" looking
to kiss his butt. The man is a slob and loves to target low hanging
fruit. Let's see him spend some of his money on the hungry, or on drug
research. Do something worthy. We already have an entire city of mud

This is the most over-rated movie ever. I think people have gotten
caught up in the politics and lost sight of how bad the narration,
editing and sound editing truly is. It seems like this was slapped
together in a rush to get it out before the election. Further, the
jokes are juvenile and (not so) subtle political points are aimed at
the lowest intelligence level. My only real shock with this movie is
that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has NOT moved up
its award presentation so as to give this junk the "Best Picture" award
BEFORE the election! It is clear that Hollywood is so wrapped up in
politics they don't even care about good cinema anymore. That is a
shame. In the end I think this will end up hurting John Kerry. Mr.
Kerry is desperately trying to get his message out, but he is
constantly getting upstaged by the Clintons, Al Gore, Hollywood, and
now Michael Moore.Is anyone listening to John Kerry? If I was Kerry I would be saying to
Hollywood "SHUT UP....let ME run for president and you make
entertainment." Good luck.....................

OK.....listen people. Michael moore has sure got his spotlight, giving
his opinion and all. One thing you must remember though is that he is
not giving the entire story, only things that sounds good to him, not
to Bush. His documentary cannot be trusted or believed. Now, there's
this kid Michael Wilson who is going to give the real truth, the whole
truth, not his own opinion. He asked to interview Michael Moore but
Moore won't do it. He says he is only in his own movies. I can name two
movies michael moore has been in. "Canadian Bacon" and "The Big One".
WOW, he lied........again. The truth is people, Moore is scared. He is
scared of Michael Wilson, Michael Savage, Bill O Reilly, etc. He makes
these documentary's because it's his own stupid opinion for two hours.
You don't hear the other side. Don't waste your money on Moore,
instead, support Wilson and hope that Moore has the balls to talk to
him, if not, Moore is just a coward.

In an era of moral equivalences, ad hominems, and relativisms, truth has
taken a back seat to name-calling, whining, and false accusations; Michael
Moore has mastered has mastered all three techniques. He has mastered them
so well, in fact, that he is accumulating a huge profit by espousing
half-truths and promoting himself in the process.Moore understands that people are stupid. Those who hate Bush already would
be amused by a movie that pokes fun at Bush in any way, regardless of
whether or not the content is fair or even true. As he proved in Bowling for
Columbine, it doesn't matter whether or not he tells the truth; people will
love what he says as long as it agrees with what they already believe. Given
the fact that there are actually a few "elements of truth" in Fahrenheit
9/11, it's no wonder that the response by liberal critics has been so
ejaculatory.And truth, really, is what it boils down to--not one-sidedness or bias, as
some critics would have you believe. One of Moore's favorite tactics: not
telling the whole story. It allows him to deceive without actually lying.
(For example, Moore says that the Taliban visited Texas to discuss a
possible Unocal pipeline deal; what he doesn't tell you is that the deal
failed in 1998 and had been supported previously by the Clinton
administration.)Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that Moore is telling us the truth
throughout the film. Even in this case, there is a huge, insurmountable
problem: Moore offers no solutions. Fahrenheit 9/11 is simply a character
assassination--nothing more, nothing less. Even when asked in a recent
interview whether or not Americans should vote for Kerry, Moore was
hesitant; he isn't happy with anybody or anything, and likely never will be.
Without solutions, persuasion is impossible.Moore's apparent thesis--that Bush and his cronies are bent on world
domination--is laughably absurd. Fahrenheit 9/11 is essentially a long
string of insane conspiracy theories babbled by a lunatic you'd normally
expect to see somewhere in a Manhattan subway clinging to a sign with a
warning about an impending apocalyptic nightmare. The only people who can
truly appreciate a movie like this are those who are most susceptible
believe lies, distortions, and inaccuracies--that is, the gullible. Don't
become one of them.

If you believe the garbage in this film, I would love to sell you some
real estate. I do not think MM would agree with any war no matter what
had happened. I would save your money and read newspapers. In addition, why do
left-wingers think that the media is biased to the right? Maybe too
much weed.To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to
promote those terms to the level of respectability. To describe this
film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that
would never again rise above the excremental. To describe it as an
exercise in facile crowd-pleasing would be too obvious. Fahrenheit 9/11
is a sinister exercise in moral frivolity, crudely disguised as an
exercise in seriousness. It is also a spectacle of abject political
cowardice masking itself as a demonstration of "dissenting" bravery.

I respect the freedom to express your opinion. That is why I'm writing
this. While that freedom is essential in America, your opinion should
be based on facts. This movie is based on one man's prejudice. The
movie follows rumors that have drifted around the country ever since
the war began. No factual evidence has been found to support the rumors
about "our horrible president" that are portrayed in this "film." The
war was necessary, whether Americans want to admit it or not. Without
it, the Saddam regime would have grown in power until the violence was
brought to our own country. Had that happened, Moore wouldn't have been
able to make his little movie expressing his biased opinions. Freedom
isn't free. You can criticize the gov't all you want, but don't you
think it should be based on something real and true instead of
Hollywood gossip? It's sad that so many will be misled by this film. If
you haven't seen it yet, I would suggest knowing your facts before you
watch it and then come to your own conclusions. Hate the president if
you want, but don't base your hate on something that isn't true.

While we all may have our opinions of President Bush and Michael Moore
and democrats and republicans etc., one thing that remains constant is
that Fahrenheit 9/11 will not change anybody's mind on any of those
topics. The movie is so aggressive that any mediocre republican will be
offended while the casual democrat will cheer Moore on and clap their
hands after a theatre showing. Thus my experience having seen the movie
with a group of friends. But what's even more important here is that
the intention of this movie is to inform Americans AND (in addition)
change the voter turn-out, maybe even launch Bush out of office. It
seems to me objectivity would have been the answer, but it is nowhere
to be found. The movie isn't about theatre goers (Americans) critically thinking
about their views it's about affirming or negating Michael Moore's view
- because of this approach, the film serves no useful purpose.
(Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't even offer a single indication of a solution.
Getting Bush out of office doesn't fix the proposed problems, does it?) It does not inspire individual reflection in most cases, especially
among the younger crowd. However, one of the main points Americans seem
to agree upon is the movie's effective portrayal of an entire
government full of corruption. While the movie fails, in it's lack of
objectivity, to point out all the little faults that are wrong with
democrats, or even one democrat, (but really picking at republicans),
viewers can still deduce that there is no hope for honest government.
We can all be assured that financial interests will be maintained at
any cost, in any place around the world. In fact Moore's film assures us of what Machiavelli's structural
functionalist views assumed 600 years ago - that men can be evil,
people are ruled through fear, and war is inevitable and often
necessary. With a corrupt government that thrives on financial interests (often
latched onto investors from around the World ... other countries
monies), hundreds of soldiers dying for a cause that is less than
satisfactory, and a desensitized, apathetic population, anarchy starts
to sound very appealing.Thank you Michael Moore for sharing pessimism, sarcasm, and
existentialism with us, we are all much happier as we look towards our
futures.

If this movie was not built on all out lies and one man's opinion, It
might be a decent film. I'm not Democrat or Republican. I'm just a TRUE
American and while I'm glad that Mr. Moore has the right to express his
thoughts freely, he should do it factually if he is going to present it
as fact. Otherwise he should have made it more opinionative, because
that is what it is. His view and his opinion are presented as if they
are 100 percent factual. "SHAME ON YOU MR. MOORE!" But, As it is, this
movie is nothing more than lies and half-truths. Do your homework
before seeing this (Like Moore should have before filming it)and you
will agree! Don't waste $7.50 on this film. Wait for it to come on HBO
or Showtime!!!

This film is so obviously propaganda; it amazes me that so many people
are taking it as gospel. How can anyone think that this trash is a
factual documentary? I suspect that the rule of unintended consequences
will take effect here and the film will actually cause some sympathy
for George Bush. It may even help swing some votes his way. Those showering the movie
with glowing praise and unmitigated support have either not seen it or
are unbelievably naïve. Along with calling Bush childish names, they
accept as facts things like Moore's contention that Bin Laden's
relatives were allowed to leave the country when no aircraft were
flying and without being checked by the FBI, both false. I guess my
biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't really contribute
anything meaningful to the discussion the country is having on Iraq,
the coming election or the war on terrorism. Mr. Moore, all you've done is waste everyone's time with your diatribe.

Since Michael Moore cares about the victims of 9/11 and our Armed
Forces, I'm sure he will donate all of his profits from this film to
the families of 9/11 and our Armed Forces.Yeah Right. It's all about the money for Michael Moore...nothing else.This anti-American tripe ought not to be shown because it's not a
documentary. A documentary is journalism. A documentary is a presentation of facts.
This is not. This is a propaganda film. It has nothing to do with
journalism. It's filled with things that are untruth. Moore has made up an interview that he had with Fred Barnes of The
Weekly Standard and the Fox News Channel. Barnes says, "I never talked
to him and in this movie he says I did. I never talked to Michael
Moore." He makes up a lot of things. In Bowling For Columbine he staged an incident, there's a bank in
Traverse City in Michigan where if you went in and make a certain size
deposit they'd give you a rifle. It never happened. And he dramatized
the scene to make it look like it was for real because Bowling for
Columbine is a pro-gun control piece of propaganda, not a documentary.

How can a biased movie like this be allowed for release?? This is democracy
at its most rediculous. Its ok to have an opinion and to express it, but to
filth millions of other people's minds with this opinion is outrageous.
Movies are supposed to be for entertainment and education, not for political
propaganda and degrading our leaders! Sensible adults are going to turn a
blind eye to this piece of rubbish, but what about the kids?? They won't
know whats right and whats wrong, they are just going to agree to these
lies!! Why don't we just start all sorts of propaganda. We might as well
promote smoking, drug usage and murder, since those are not any more extreme
than Moore's views about president Bush. There is no boundaries anymore in
film making, there is no right or wrong or a limit. People can just produce
movies according to their views and blind others with it!

I view this as a slanted, left wing vehicle intended only to bash
President Bush, and our armed forces. If you ask anyone who was there,
(and I speak to returning soldiers and sailors daily) you will find
that 90% totally disagree with Mr. Moores movie and dismiss it as left
wing propaganda. The truth is Mr. Moore so hates any conservative
thought, he edits his film to suit the left wing agenda. He is
currently being sued by several of the people that he has in the movie,
for editing their footage to suit his ideals. The sad thing is, that
the politically ignorant people, those who choose to believe the bias
of the liberal press and movies such as this one, will continue to
chant the left's catch-phrases and ideas, without any alternative ideas
as to the solutions of the problems that face us now. It's too bad that
people see this as a documentary, instead of the entertainment, fiction
that it actually is.

does in a cinema the world would be a very different place. I
appreciate that there is a need for someone to collect and present

opposite point of air vented in the same forum.

Fahrenheit 9/11....where do I start at? Probably at the need for such a
movie. Does the current situation in the government need questioning?
Of course it does. With as many fundamental changes in the past four
years (Not only 9/11 but the Department of Homeland Security and the
Patriot Act) an assessment is needed. Are we winning in the war on
terror? Is this the way our country should be going? What really is
happening beyond the nightly news? The trouble is an assessment would
be just that, and it would also require objectivity, such as seeing
President Bush as being something other than Satan, and critiquing the
intelligence and diplomatic failures of Clinton, Reagan, and further on
back. I have no doubt in fifty or a hundred years the events of this
time will be seen in a completely different light than now.And is F9/11 that needed assessment? Not in any way shape or form. An
intelligent and thoughtful movie could have been constructed around the
Patriot Act alone, which would also have been boring and required the
audience to think.F9/11 is little more than a Bush/Right Wing basher's dream movie, and
Michael Moore goes beyond trying to make any sort of documentary into
the realm of bringing every conspiracy theory of the past thirty years
to life. In the world he presents, there is NO terrorist threat,
everything is an Orwellian conspiracy to make phony wars for money, and
Bush/Halliburton/Cheney are somehow behind it all.Much of the movie has been debunked on web sites and talk shows, yet
what really bothered me is many fans of this movie realized it was full
of distortions and falsehoods, yet accepted it anyways. Like the
debacle with CBS and the National Guard memos, the evidence may be
false but the message is true.Three things really stood out in my mind and bothered me about this
movie. The first was arguably is the movie's main talking point, about
how the Bin Laden family was allegedly moved out of the US before the
airspace had opened after 9/11. (Again debunked, but play along.) With
his usual snideness Moore says that one of the first people to talk to
after someone commits a crime is the family. But he ignores two key
points: 1. The Bin Laden family is huge, Mohammed Bin Laden had over twenty
children, and many of them have not seen Osama Bin Laden since 1981.2. Nowhere has Michael Moore or any left wing conspiracy theorist come
up with proof or evidence that any of the people on those planes did
know something, or could provide any sort of intelligence.Indeed, the better people to talk to would have been Osama's associates
since he's been playing revolutionary for two decades in places like
Afghanistan and Sudan, not hobnobbing with his family. However, for
Moore and his audience, simply raising the allegation is good enough.The second thing that bothered me is when Moore goes traipsing around
to several congressman trying to get them to sign up their children to
join the military. Completely forgotten is that to join the military a
person must be 18 and therefore an adult, the parents legally CAN'T
sign their own children up. Did this somehow escape Moore's vaunted
three-tier fact-checking system? The last thing is the now infamous
scenes of a Iraq before the war started. Moore can say whatever he
wants, but the impression put on people in the theater, and on me, was
that he was saying Iraq was a peaceful and happy place we just started
bombing. We get a vague showing of Rumsfeld next to Saddam and the
implication of more military industrial conspiracies as we supported
Saddam in the eighties, but that's about it. Not mentioned is our
relation to Iran at that time and the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988. Or
the First Gulf War. Or the Kurdish rebellion. Or of Saddam's role as a
torturer at the Palace of the End. There was plenty of blame to go
around for everyone.I fully believe Moore knew much of his movie was bogus, and instead
intended it to play into what the audience wanted to hear. Certainly a
lot of gullible people were buying it up when it came out. The
Democrats and the thinking Left didn't outrightly endorse the movie,
but instead were more than glad to let it ride as long as it was
helping them out.And therein lies the ultimate failure of Moore's "opinion piece"
documentary. Judging from some of the remarks he was posting on his
website last summer, he seemed surprised that the movie ran it's course
and left the theaters. I really think he was expecting F9/11 to spark a
revolution. But the only people who bought the message were already
converted. A movie such as this, so blatantly out to destroy Bush, if
anything had a backlash. Many people, including me, were motivated to
go out and vote against Kerry. This cost the Democrats a lot of power,
and I think Moore lost a good portion of his clout.Indeed, I believe this movie will be the high water mark of his career.
Too many people now know his style and approach, and aren't willing to
be featured in his movies. And I don't think anybody at this point is
still believing his "common man with a camera" image. In ten years, I
really think nobody will even know who Michael Moore is. Or was.

I am 23 years old, saw Fahrenheit 9/11, have friends in the military,
and I voted for Bush. This film wasn't just bad, I can deal with bad
films if they make a point, it was downright insulting to my
intelligence. The connection that Moore tried to make with Bush and the
Bin Ladens is where I stopped believing this movie could present
evidence. So a guy who didn't take a medical exam in the 70's with
Bush, invests money into Bush's business, but, heres the kicker, that
man received money from the Bin Laden family, one of the wealthiest
families in the world to invest. That is reaching for something that
isn't there. I guess if you hate a leader enough you are willing to
overlook the lengths Moore went to make a connection. Anyway, even
disregarding the political stuff and looking at this film
objectively(which I tried to so, probably not with much success), it is
boring to the informed, disjointed, and sad really that someone would
devote an entire film to hatred of another. I liked Bowling for
Columbine even though I disagreed with its message, it was a cool way
of looking at the events. Fahrenheit wasn't entertaining and was
another example of just who much out of touch some people are with
society that anyone would believe the BS in this "film".

I have seen this movie twice now and both times I found this movie
appalling. This move is not a documentary, it is not a truthful display
of what's going on in our country, and it not a truthful display of our
President. Michael Moore strikes again with his socialistic approach
and ideas. I do not see how anyone can find this movie entertaining or
insightful. I do not like Michael Moore and I do not like his views.
This movie is not a must see, it is not the years best film, and it is
not a documentary (because it does not show both size, it is a one
sided malicious insult directed toward our country's fighting men and
women and our country's Commander and Chief). I rate this movie

Hi guys. I'm a fan of Michael Moore's work. I enjoyed Roger & Me and
Bowling for Columbine, but did have to admit even in those films that
some of his points were a bit unbalanced. I just saw Fahrenheit 9/11
for the first time last night. I do have to admit some bias, as I am a
supporter of the president. Apart from lacking some of the zing and
excitement of his past films, this film was, by far, the most one sided
film of his that I have seen. Seriously! There are equally effective
arguments to many of the points he brought up. Some of his claims were
so absurd and lacking in logic. I appreciate his perspective, and am
glad he made the film - he is free to present his opinions, and does it
effectively. I just can't believe that people blindly agree with all of
his points and use them as arguments against the re-election of George
Bush. I wouldn't expect any congressmen or women to enlist their children in
the the armed forces when prompted by Michael Moore. That is the
individual's decision - not their parents!So what if the Bushes invest in a company that Saudis also invest in. I
don't get the big deal. So what if the Saudi ambassador had dinner with
George Bush days after 9/11. Wouldn't you expect them to meet to
discuss what had just happen?Do you know how many warnings of terrorism this administration and the
Clinton administration get/got on a daily basis? There is no way you
can convince me that Sept. 11 was preventable. Who in this country
understood that those terrorists were so willing to sacrifice
themselves and pull off such a drastic attack?It is outrageous to suggest that George Bush was "in on" 9/11.What is Michael Moore's suggestion for Iraq? Just pull out all forces
immediately?

There are many times in my day when this movie crosses my mind. The
ridiculous allegations and accusations toward President Bush are simply
put ignorant. Those of you who think you know everything about the war
or who think that the media and Michael Moore have portrayed the war
accurately are ignorant. Those of you who do not have family in the war
do not know what is really happening. Those of you who have family in
the war I would like to thank you and thank your family members for
their courage and patriotism that many of our fellow Americans have
lost. If someone wanted to and had the money they could make a movie
about how bad charity was a terrible thing and direct it at whomever
they wanted. You might say this is way different than that and I agree
with you but only a coward would not fight for his country. Michael
Moore is only using his money, his greed, his stupid opinion and your
ignorance to exploit everything the way he wants. Anyone who travels to
other countries and calls Americans stupid is not an American to me.
Thank you to all the Christians, Patriots, Soldiers, President George
W. Bush, and definitely not to the coward, ignorant people that agree
with the UN-American Michael Moore.Ckey

The movie was based on things that were out of context. In some of the
interviews, the people didn't know they were being interviewed. He
basically used a hidden camera. He attacked people and as evidence he
used quotes that were out of context. They had nothing to do with the
point he was trying to prove. I hated that movie. He said that
President Bush knew about 9/11. He had no idea that terriorists were
going to hijack commercial airline planes and fly them into the World
Trade Centers, attempt to fly a plane into the White House, or the
Pentegon. If he would have known the who, what, when's...he would not
have let it happen. And President Clinton knew just as much about it as
Bush but he never mentioned it because Moore is a Democrat who is just
trying to blame a republican.

Moore is probably the dumbest person ever to walk the face of the earth.  He
thinks he can fool anyone with old communist tricks , trying to warp
reality.  This movie is pure leftist political violent
propaganda.
 As one other reviewer said there are no facts to back-up anything he
presents, and besides America was a much better place before people like
Michael Moore existed.
Whatever your political views are if you have a little bit of common sense
you will understand that Moore is an ideologist with extreme views that can
only raise hatred among people who watch his movies.
Please don't be fooled by this lying pig.

I just saw this documentary yesterday and while it is interesting,
however, it is so unabashedly anti-Bush that this documentary is
nothing more than one-sided view of things rather than trying to be a
balanced view of Bush, terrorism, and the war in Iraq. One of the first
tenets of journalism is being balanced in your report, regardless of
your personal views but this documentary failed to do this. It is so
skewed that Michael Moore does a great disservice to the viewing public
by releasing such unbalanced documentary. One of the things I found
disturbing is his editing of interviews to make it seem his
interviewee's are saying one thing when in fact they are not, but you
would not know this since Moore does not want to show this.While I am no fan of President Bush nor the war in Iraq, however, I
believe all views on the topics should have been represented rather
than Michael Moore's sole view on the matter. If this was to be Moore's
interpretation on these events, then he should state it as such rather
than try to pass this as a true documentary.I encourage all of you to read your local or national newspapers and
magazines, regardless of your opinion, in order to get a balanced view
on this topic.

This is not a documentary. To call it so is a disgrace to the many true
and brilliant documentaries that have been filmed.Rather, F 9/11 is pure leftist propaganda, full of lies, half-truths,
and misleading facts. See the upcoming film, "MICHAEL MOORE HATES America." This is a true
documentary.Moore is a disgrace when he infiltrates the privacy of the sobbing
mother of a soldier who died in Iraq, shoving the camera in her face
even as she weeps. He exploits her emotions for political gain. Bush
haters love this movie, sure, but anyone can be painted into a monster
when you show half the story.Not a brilliant movie.To call it such is to expose that the reviewer is merely a leftist
Bush-hater.Cheap shots such as showing Wolfowitz spitting on his comb are nothing
but third grade cheap shots. This is not film-making at its finest.
Hatred leads to one's downfall. Moore's hatred will hurt himself in the
long run.By the way, the supposed champion of the lower and middle class, Moore,
lives in a multi-million dollar apartment on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan and sends his kids to one of the most expensive and exclusive
private schools. Can you say contradiction? -A Proud New Yorker

This movie lacks credibility because the director lacks credibility. 
Previous works by Michael Moore has been full of deliberate distortions and
inaccuracies.  Documentation of errors and misrepresentations in his
previous films is well documented on the internet.The film was OK and interesting. However I would probably like the film
better if it were produced by someone who is more honest and fair than
Michael Moore.   It's easier to make an interesting or entertaining
"documentary" when you discard truths, distort facts, use fake setups, and
manipulate editing. Moore has a history of doing unethical things to create
his films. Because it's difficult to know what is fact, fantasy, and false setups you
need to be careful when viewing films by Michael Moore.  You cannot accept
his films as being accurate because he has an agenda and makes his
documentaries to conform to his agenda even if some manipulation or false
misrepresentations are needed to accomplish this.I agree with much of what his views are in the film. However, I do not
respect the messenger or the tactics he uses to convey his message.  If this
film where made by a director who had more integrity and honesty then I
would have more respect this film. Because this is a film by Michael Moore I
am left wondering what is accurate and what are intential misrepresentations
that Moore has put into a film.  I find it difficult to put much faith or credence in a film by a director
who himself manipulates the facts and uses editing tricks, false statement,
and ambushed interviews as part of documentary technques.  I would like to
see a documentary made about Michael Moore and see how well he would hold up
under scrutiny if someone were to take a close look at him.If someone wanted to, they could probably easily create a documentary about
Moore that would make him look worse then how he makes other people look in
his films. Moore contradicts himself.  He criticizes the integrity of others, but he
himself uses dishonest tactics and false allegations to create his films. 
By doing so he discredits himself, his views, and his work.

Normally, regardless of whether I agree with Michael Moore's views or
not, Ialways am interested listening to what he has to say, and like his
style.This movie has none of that style, it is just a flat-out heavy-handed
vitreous attack. I have no problem at all with the topic, I'm not
Pro-Bush by any means, but I know what Moore is capable of, and I know
he could have made aninsightful, informative film on the same topic. Instead he chose to
just make this exploitative, vicious, venomous,
so-slanted-it's-near-horizontal piece ofpropaganda. It has its moments, and certainly there was some interesting
information. But the overall message is ruined by the relentless
hammering it home with a bluntheavy object to the viewer's skull.

The movie is complete propaganda and fantasy created solely to mislead
the stupid masses. Case in point. The movie provides that, in December
1997, a delegation of top Taliban officials visited the United States
at the invitation of officials from Unocal, a California-based oil and
gas company with extensive business dealings in Texas. At the time,
Unocal was pursuing a deal to construct a gas pipeline through
Afghanistan. Moore notes that the delegation visited Texas while Bush
was governor. He doesn't say the delegation met with Bush, but that is
implied. In fact, Bush did not meet with the Taliban representatives.
What Moore also doesn't say is that Clinton administration officials at
the State Department did sit down with the Taliban officials and that
their visit was made with the Clinton administration's permission. Go
ahead, morons, "believe."

Michael Moore is a talented filmaker, with a talent for using humor as a way
of making the bluntness of his points plainly apparent. His films I often
find disagreeable, sometimes highly so, but I often find myself laughing
during them anyways. He is also someone i would call an ambulance chaser,
taking issues out of the spotlight and using them to push his radical
political agenda. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a film which does this to an eggregious, shameless
extent, to the point where he goes against his own credo as a documentarian.
Though his films often leave out much of the other side of the argument,
they generally do a good job at educating the public on issues they are not
well aware of. His latest film takes advantage of the fact that most of us
are not well-educated on certain events in order to be able to make the
ridiculous points of the film sound well-founded. Working on the assumption that most of his audience is A: liberal and B:
ill-informed, Moore takes what is actually not the most confidential
information and puts a radical spin on it, making the Bush administration
look like it much more control over the events of 9/11 and beyond than it,
or any administration, could possibly have had. It demonizes the president
way beyond the point to which he is able to be legitimately criticized for
his mistakes, which are legion. What he doesn't want you to remember is that
our government is every bit as responsible for deciding on the actions taken
since 9/11 as our president and that John Kerry, his party's chosen one, was
behind the agenda every bit of the way until it went wrong.Michael Moore is a person that people look to when they are disillusioned at
the current state of things, whether the rest of us like it or not. However,
in the case of Fahrenheit 9/11, he uses the growing resentment of the bad
state of things to hoodwink the public, and the resulting film has way more
holes in it than in other Moore works. The film is ultimately a cheap shot
at the right, which Moore made because he knew he could get away with it. It
is not really documentary, and something worse than yellow journalism. It's
sensationalism, and it's success has cheapened the value of the Palme
D'or.

This is a bad film. Period! I don't know where to begin.Both Michael Moore's hatred for the Bush family and his disdain for
traditional American values, are well documented in this piece of
trash. Moore's a malcontent with a warped sense of reality. At least
his early documentary, "Roger and Me", had some redeeming social value.
"Fahrenheit 911" is pure left-wing hate propaganda. It's filled with
lies, distortions and fabrications. I have no doubt, Moore's fellow
malcontents in Hollywood will vote him an Academy Award for his
efforts. I suggest Michael Moore move to France. Over there, Moore's overall
film work would be better appreciated by all the anti-American
Euro-socialists that populate the old world.

Once again, by using very one-sided images and quotes taken out of
context, Moore makes his anti-US anti-Bush case. Not real surprising
that he got a top prize, voted for by the liberal Hollywood elite, in
France no less. Luckily I didn't have to pay to see it... just wasted a
couple of hours of my life. Its also interesting to see how people have
voted for this... two thirds give it a 10, and one third give it a 1...
with very few in between. I would be very interested in finding out how
many of the folks that gave this piece of crap a 10 actually saw it.
How many of you gave it a 10 just because you agree with Moore's
twisted politics and, like him, have a unreasoning hatred of President
Bush?

Michael Moore and this movie make me sick and disgusted. This movie is
nothing more that liberal minds at work trying to spread evil and chaos
like cancer. Unfortunately many innocent people die during a war and
many bad things happen. Thankfully it is easier for us to sit here in
America and bad mouth all that's being done while the soldiers suffer
where ever they are. I personally think that all of liberal Hollywood
should mind there own businesses and remember that they have not made
any great accomplishments or changed any ones lives yet. They sit in
there wonderful homes and voice there opinions like they know
something. I say this, Michael Moore and his mother, wife and daughters
should go live in the middle east and see what life is like there. I
would like to see his movie then. We are all lucky to live in this
country and should show appreciation to it. Did I agree with x
President Clinton, no I did not but I would not bad mouth him or go
against my country in a time of need. Remember all you liberals who
voted for that man. He just so happened to be a draft dodger who
protested against his country in another country. Why isn't there a
movie about that. If you don't like this country you don't have to live
here and more important you don't have to work here. If Michael Moore
thinks he can do better some where else he should try. Shame on him and
this trash movie.

I am all about freedom of speech and their god given rights accorded to
the U.S. citizens from the Constitution. This movie will either make
you hate President Bush for Michael Moore's adaptation of what he
considers the truth. He fails, however, to mention that the events Sept
11, 2001 could possibly have been prevented if the previous President,
as proved by the 9-11 Commission Report. There were many failures that
led to the events; however, to blame one President (Republican) for all
actions, is being a poor sport. As a person who supports left wing
issues you can only expect it. The movie was a wonderful example of how
America is so great. Had this movie come out in the former Soviet
Union, Mr. Moore would have been dealt with quickly. For that reason
only I gave it a "3". I would have given it a higher rating "7-8" if he
would have shown more than a one-sided opinion. God Bless America!Watch and make your own determination.

8 out of 10? Are you daft? Name one truth from this film, can you
actually support any of the accusations with *gasp* FACTS? This film is
not only a group of poorly edited lies, but it is TREASON. If you
support Moore, you are mine and Americas enemy.Time to show your true colors, support your local jihad, support your
'freedom fighters'.How do you support the positions taken during Clintons Presidency, but
vilify President Bush? Too busy supporting the party and not the policy
I presume...Any student of history that spends one iota of time researching the
content of this piece of garbage will soon realize that point of this
film is to derail any response to the Islamofacist attacks on my
beautiful country. All seemingly because Moore has the guilt of
supporting the Naders Green party, which may have cost Gore the 2000
election, this be the root cause of the making of this film. (Thank GOD
Gore wasn't President during the attacks of 9/11/2001!)Are you prepared to defend your liberal revisionist, apologist position
the next time America is attacked, God forbid? Will you stand against
the terrorist when your time to defend you country upon the next
threat? I doubt you have the spine.Name one civilization other than the USA that freed 25 million at the

I believe Michael Moore is only but an opportunist. What I mean is that
it has become popular to hate the U.S. and this 'director' has,
ingeniously, spotted this and made a hit. But it is not only Mr. Moore,
also BBC and CNN. No one sees these networks having their reporters
saying ANYTHING good about Bush. The moment they do people will stop
watching, which is obvious because the public sees and hears what they
like. In some way its wrong because it's not the way news should be
told, I always knew that reporting had to be non-partial and neutral
(how can it when news centers are more left-sided). I believe people
should see and think outside the box with such fragile things as the
war on Irag and silly things as even thinking that Mr. Bush would
missile the pentagon, I mean come on! But I guess that this subject and
others alike make Mr. Moore's so called "documentary" look good, or
alike, or even satisfy what most people want to see. I can't blame the
people for hating Bush, all they see is a man making a war with no
sense on the poor Iraqi people. But what I do blame the people is for
not wondering why this man would do such a thing and even ask
themselves "are the Iraqi people so innocent?" Of course, their not all
terrorists, practically a very very small percent but that;s not the
case. What I think is that people see short-term about this and not
long-term. If one sees Iraq, one only sees no opportunity for progress
in health, security and many other grounds. Though think for a moment
now and wonder how Iraq will be in say 20 to 50 years from now,
possibly nothing but at least now they have a better chance. No one
sees this, nor the fact that not as many people would be dead if there
wouldn't have been any resistance from Iraq. Who would think that the
U.S. would go there to kill? Any ignorant, but I don't want to insult.
It is very possible that Mr. Bush went there to get some oil but at
least now terrorism can be abolished better. So anyways, I can go on
and on with such cases but I'm afraid I haven't the time, all I want is
for people to think by themselves, think that maybe Mr. Bush isn't that
bad, that maybe others are making bad as well.

It's very easy to put together film clips from people and events in
such a way to make anyone look bad. Moore had a clear agenda; he admits
to hating Bush, and he did his best to make Bush, America, and our
military look bad. Too bad so many Bush-haters can't see through that.Moore profited more from the American tragedy of 9-11 and the Iraqi war
more than anyone else on Earth. Those who care about the truth have
read about the lies and distortions in this movie; they are too many to
name. His attack on Cheney/Halliburton is typical socialist spin; many of his
friends on the left parrot the same junk. As of the end of 2004, 62
Halliburton employees have been killed in Iraq, while trying to do
their job. Maybe someone on the left could explain how Halliburton
could do things differently. Don't like a no bid contract like the one
given to Halliburton? Great. Let's bid on a several billion dollar job.
The problem with that proposal is that it would take 15 months for the
bid, and conditions would change so much that the bid would be
worthless. What other company in the world does what Halliburton does
in these conditions? None. That's why they got the job. This is just
one example to show how Moore's 911 is a cheap shot patchwork.

This movie was full of contradictions, high-handedness, and frankly,
s***. There was no central theme, no real point made, just as in
"Bowling For Columbine." But its not a term paper, so I guess it could
get a 5 out of 10. I will always side with those who defend the
defenseless, and Michael Moore seems to do that very well. But just as
the poor are exploited to fight wars, work meaningless jobs, and
instill fear into the hearts of good old white Americans, are they not
also being exploited here by Moore to further his own agenda? Remember,
Michael Moore is a millionaire too. I can't help but think that Moore
was the unpopular kid in high school who thinks he is smarter than
everyone else and that includes those who he is "defending" here. Though Moore did call out the Democrats on a couple of occasions, I
think that a better film would have focused on their failures rather
than spend half the time playing connect the dots with Bush and Bin
Laden. Moore's anger seemed just as misguided here as it did in Bowling
For Columbine. Maybe Moore has a hard time calling out the Democrats
because his job involves just as much hypocrisy and manipulation as
theirs. But I might be wrong, Moore might be genuine and heartfelt, and I
believe that Bush has lied to further the agenda for his
administration. But in a fight between Foxnews and Michael Moore, I
choose Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

I'm an Independent. So I gave the film a fair shake. After I saw it, I
decided to see if Michael Moore's claims were true. So I started
researching them on the Internet. Guess what I found out? They were
pretty much false and mis construed! I didn't find anything true!For instance, the claim most of the soldiers killed were minorities.
FALSE. I checked the mortality report. Over 70% were white, and most
were Iowans, born in my home state. Why? Because most of the troops are
from Iowa.Second, the claim the Saudis flew out of the United States before any
Americans could start flying again right after 9/11. FALSE. The Saudis
only flew out AFTER the ban was lifted and AFTER they have a VERY deep
background check by the FBI. Just like we Americans. Where'd I find
this? The AP.Third. The Carlisle thing. Bush was not involved with the Carlisle
group at ALL when he became President. The Bush's broke off all ties
with the group two years before the candidacy began. Where'd I find
this? The Wall Street Journal.Michael Moore even bragged that he's never been sued because "What I
say is the truth." Well, get this, Michael Moore is currently being
sued by an Illinois newspaper for changing one of their headlines and
plastering it for all to see in his little film. I hope they win.These are just a few of the things of what I found out. If you just
want to be fed a bunch of blowhard storyline by a pretentious director,
that's fine by me, but I prefer to think for myself. The entire film is
just propaganda by a mean-spirited individual who wants to make a bunch
of money on the side. I have no respect for Michael Moore as a
filmmaker, and even less as a person. My rating for this film? NO
STARS.

Very cheap shot at the American foreign policy. The author does not
understand what kind of dangerous world we live in. This sense of
domestic safety and prosperity is misleading. The film did not say
anything new and has not shown any revelations. However, I am not so
disappointed in Mr. Moore's work as I am disappointed in decision of
the Cannes Festival to award it with the highest prize. Shame, shame on
the festival that has been once an example for real cinematographic
art!I am a refugee from the former Soviet Union and issues reflected by the
film are very close to me and my family. It is just a shame that some
people do not understand the global danger of totalitarian regimes. And
the one we face these days is the worst - it does not even recognize
state borders. For them there are only two countries - their own and
the enemy's. And Mr. Moore is trying to talk about legitimacy of
invading Iraq! For terrorists themselves Iraq's borders and its
sovereignty are irrelevant. See how do they operate in Iraq trying to
affect lives in France? Wake up, people and face reality!

This film is incontrovertible evidence that Michael Moore is a
propagandist, not a documentary filmmaker. As a propagandist, he is a
competent spinmaster. In another time and place, masters such as the
Nazis and Russian Communists would have been happy to have him serve
them.See this film if you must, but be a true free-thinking person if you do
so. Whatever questions Moore may ask, be sure to ask your own. Whatever
"substance" one may see here, be sure to combine it with the much
larger body of other, objective evidence that Moore does not see fit to
present on screen. Do not mistake his presentation of half-truths and
outright deceptions as hard, lucid analysis of the film's subject
matter.Some may see this movie as a bold example of free speech, one that
should be lauded for challenging America's political leaders. Free
speech is indeed laudable, but so is objective truth. Ideals are
virtues so long as they are fully and completely grounded in life's
realities. When not so grounded, they are dangerous and ultimately
self-defeating.At its core, this film is nothing other than political profiteering. It
is one man's self-aggrandizing attempt to milk the prejudices of one
political faction against another. Is this what you really want either
America or the world to be about?

What a waste of film. I can't believe anyone would believe this
one-sided bastardization of recent history. We can check the facts on
this - too bad Mr. Moore didn't. He ignored or left out any point of
view or facts that opposed him which makes a very poor documentary
indeed. Maybe he really believe the American people are stupid, but we
should give ourselves more credit than that and just pass this movie
off as a fantasy flick. Celebrities flock to this because it takes the
blame off of their morally corrupt lifestyles which is a huge reason
why the religious zealots hate the United States. Save your money, save
your time - read the facts from the news sources.

First off, I am a big fan of Michael Moore's film making.  At his worst was
his A&E TV series, 'The Awful Truth', which was still good but not great. 
At his best, was 'Roger and Me' and 'Bowling for Columbine'.  Particularly,
the latter.Farenheit 9/11 is more in the flavor of the TV series.  It doesn't come
close to matching the greatness of his two prior movies.  Basically,
Farenheit 9/11 is a collection of TV news clips, most of them out of
context, put together in such a way to suggest his point of view.  Despite
his attempts, I just found the connections he was trying to make via film
far-fetched in some cases.  Frankly, I found it boring and I kept looking at
my watch all the way through.However, none of this is saying that I disagree with the essence of what he
is trying to say, I just disagree with the way he's saying it.  Everybody
I've talked to has told me that they thought it was amazing and an important
film to see.  Of course, this always seems to happen to me.  A movie gets
high reviews and I go in to the theater with too high of expectations.  I
was just let down a lot.The worst part of the film was the TV clips, which were a good part of the
movie.  They weren't cleaned up a bit, they were blurry, and should have
been "re-mastered" for the wide theater screen.  It was as if my next door
neighbor went out with his hand-held video camera and shot it.  A very
amatuer type look all the way through, which yes, Michael's films have been
known for, but this was just too visually poor for the most
part.Supporting most, if not all of what Michael is trying to say here
politically, I feel he didn't do the cause any justice.  I believe I heard
on the radio that George Bush's re-election campaign was asked if they were
concnerned about this movie being released so close to the election, and
their reply was something to the effect that the movie was so far-fetched
that most people would dismiss it.  And despite it's poor quality as a film,
there's enough subject matter there to get people thinking and to sway some
votes against Bush when it's all said and done.  For that and that alone, I
applaud Michael.  It's a shame I can't applaud him for the reasons that
matter, such as filmaking quality.

People without a moral compass always find it easy to be cynical and
mistrust those who really do have one. Michael Moore is one of these
people.The true Michael Moore is well described in the book "Michael Moore is
a Big Fat Stupid White Man." It is very sad that he poisons the minds
of young people and fills them with distrust. Bitterness, cynicism, and
lying because it's the 'right thing' are all habits to be avoided. It
is so sad that he spreads his sickness.Sitting on the side and attacking is easy. Being a victim is easy.
Trying to do something is hard. Eventually Americans will see through
his lies, because it is in our nature to figure these things out. As
Reagan (someone who Michael Moore would undoubtedly hate) reminded us,
"America is the Shining City on the Hill." Part of the price of a free
society is that we have to put up with idiots like Michael Moore, but
it is a small price to pay. I would like to invite him to go to Cuba or
China and create a movie that attacks the government. He would see how
a true totalitarian government would deal with someone like him.Skip

This movie not only tries to change history it does it badly. So many
facts are either left out or changed it is like watching a parallel
world on Star Trek except Star Trek had far greater production value.
This is nothing more than a really long political commercial. It
violates several election laws and if they wanted to take the time a
lot of people could get rich from lawsuits for slander. Just another
attempt by someone to make some money off of garbage. This film is
poorly produced and many scenes are just unwatchable. Even if the
quality were better it just drones on and on using stock footage for
many scenes. That may be the one redeeming point. If for some reason
you are forced to watch this drivel you can try finding the pre-1980
footage in a movie that supposedly was made in the past few years.
Bottom line. Don't waste your time on this one.

small-minded spin-o-rama and believe a single word of it.Nah... it's not even worth more than a "YUCK". If this is where your world
is, you deserve the misery that is your life.Moore's honesty is called into question from the moment he claims the
distributor backed out (even though the original production agreement
specifically stated it was not a distribution agreement), and goes downhill
from there.Sorry to those who enjoyed this campaign-season fluff, you're buying into a

If you expect anything short of a biased opinion from this film then
you are in for a rude awakening. This film was written by the left for
the left and that is all there is to it. There is not even a shred of
objectivity in the way this trash was made, and despite agreeing with
the overall message of the film, I did not agree with the miscellaneous
tidbits of liberal propaganda that were so neatly injected.Everything Michael Moore has ever put on celluloid lacks coherence. For
those of you who might not know what that means, it means that Moore's
films are like a piece of newspaper that has been torn to 1 cm shreds
and mixed up in a big pile - and Moore "interprets" what is in the pile
for you. For example, several of Bushes speeches and sayings were
deliberately taken out of context and interspersed with what Moore was
trying to say, using them as "evidence" for his arguments. There are portions of the film that do not fit with the central
arguments being made. The section about the patrolman from Oregon and
the Homeland Security department really have no place in this movie. It
really proves nothing concerning what Moore is actually trying to say.There are portions of the film that are absolutely incorrect. The
portion about "paradise Baghdad" - where see children happily laughing
and playing under the rule of Saddam Huissein is pure <expletive
deleted> and we know it. Moore should have been objective enough to at
least portray pre-war Baghdad as the hard-life place we knew it was. Moore makes very convincing emotional arguments. The Lila Lipscombe
section will bring the audience to fits and tears. These types of
arguments do not belong in a documentary. It would be fine in any other
Hollywood movie, but NOT a documentary. The film would have been much
more effective if it had left the emotional argumentation and
unnecessary portions out and had gone into greater detail about why the
war had no purpose to begin with.In the end, one walks out of Fahrenheit 9/11 with the notion that it
was a bad documentary and that Moore should not be making
documentaries. He is a good filmmaker but his talents would be better
suited making fictional films. One of the few pluses of the film-making is that it is likely to draw
in many ignorant Americans who have no idea what their country is
currently doing. Because it is emotionally-oriented it will likely keep
the attention of the young people who have the biggest share in the
upcoming election. In the course of doing this it will plunge in the
lethal needle hanging over the Bush presidency. And for that redeeming
quality it isn't such a bad movie after all. 5/10

What happened to the guy who so brilliantly directed Roger and Me?
Keeping in line with Bowling for Columbine, Moore shimmies and shakes
around the truth and comes up with, well, another boring documentary.
Look, everyone knows Moore is just left of Castro, so if you go see
this movie, that's what you are going to get. I can deal with that. The
thing is, just like in Bowling, Moore forgot the truth. There are some
very powerful moments in this film, and if Moore really was doing an
expose of our current times as he says, this movie might be relevant.
Sadly, Moore lets his personal hatred of President Bush color any
objectiveness that he might have had and comes up with a movie that is
generally untruthful, boring and pretentious. Could have been so much
more, but as it is, it's not worth going to see. Save your money and
catch it at the video store.

Documentary - Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or
inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. * Propaganda
-Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or
cause i.e. wartime propaganda.** Definitions found at Dictionary.com.It is unusual to start a movie review with definitions of two words,
but this is the essence of my complete and total dislike of the film
"Fahrenheit 9/11" written and directed by Michael Moore. If Mr. Moore
promoted this film as a propaganda film, then I would probably give
this my highest rating possible. But he falsely promotes and maybe even
believes that this is a documentary film about President Bush and the
events leading up to and after the terrorist attacks on September 11,
2001. Since he essentially lied to the American public to try and
convince voters to vote for his candidate by the use of this
"documentary," I feel his actions are inexcusable and are of the lowest
of the low. I feel his comments in producing and promoting this movie
are on the same level as the lies committed by President Nixon during
Watergate, and President Clinton during the Monica Lewinski scandal.
All three of these instances showcase lies to the American public with
the appearance of honesty, and that is not what why founding fathers
created this country. I have two main points that show why I feel that
this is not a documentary but a propaganda film.1.) In the first 30 minutes of the film Moore explains how George W.
Bush was able to steal the election from Vice President Al Gore. He
states that his father, President George H.W. Bush was able to get
elected, nominate and confirm some Supreme Court justices that would
eventually hear the Supreme Court case Bush vs. Gore. Moore also states
that Bush, the younger, new to have his campaign manager be the
attorney general of Florida, who overseas the election results. Moore
also says the Bush was helped by his brother, who is the governor of
Florida. Moore states that Bush did all of these things to help steal
the election from Gore. Well, according the Michael Moore, Bush is not only a genius, but a
person who can tell the future. You see, for all of this to be true,
Bush had to have known in 1987, that his father would win the
presidential election in 1988, have two Supreme Court justices retire
during his father's term. Know that his father would be able to
nominate and get confirmed who he wanted on the Court. To know that his
father would lose the election in 1992 AND that President Clinton would
win in 1996, meaning he would be a two term president. Moore also must
think that Bush new he would win the election to become Governor of
Texas in 1994, and again in 1998, and to know that his brother Jeb Bush
would become Governor of Florida, and ask the Attorney General of
Florida, a close family friend, to be his campaign manager, AND LASTLY,
to know that Florida would be the deciding state in the 2000
Presidential election. Wow, maybe I have Michael Moore pegged wrong,
maybe he is a big supporter of Bush.Too me, this is pure propaganda, but we can't use that word because
most people of history will be reminded of one of the greatest
propagandist of all time, Leni Reifenstahl. She was the German
filmmaker, who in 1935 made a movie called "Triumph of the Will." This
too was a documentary on the great way of life the NAZI party and its
leader, Adolph Hitler, offered to the people of Germany as well as the
world. Now I am not comparing the two directors, I am just showing what
some people will think of when you say propaganda film.2.) The other example of why I think this is a propaganda film is that
on the night before the election, Michael Moore distributed his movie
as a pay per view event on TV. He wanted to try and convince some last
minute voters to change their mind. I have already commented on my
problem with this, being promoted as a documentary. As a documentary, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of the worst movies every
made. If documentaries are to show, "objectivity without
editorializing," then this movie is not even close. When this movie is
promoted as a propaganda film, I will offer a different opinion, until
then, this movie and its director, deserve no praise, only ridicule.This review and others can be seen at Brian and Benn's Movie Corner at

I had the chance to rent this on DVD just awhile ago. All I can say
is... I wish I could get my money back. I enjoy an far left/right
leaning movie every now and again, but this was too much. It lacked
taste and the entire movie felt preachy and to an extent smarmy. It was
also totally one sided; this was not a "documentary" more or less a
"mockumentry" that tried to use facts without any say from the
opposition. The facts are facts, I agree, but this didn't show both
sides of the issue like how a real documentary is supposed to. As a
piece of entertainment I'll give this a 4/10 but as a movie in it's
supposed genre I'm giving it -3/10.If you like something that is thought provoking (in either the positive
or negative sense)then I'd suggest you'd see this. But if you want a
neutral "say as it is" documentry, steer-clear from this and don't look
back.

critical thinking is about looking at both side of the arguments, do
your own research, then judge the claim by only proven facts. Anyone
who believe stuff said in this film either really hate bush or is just
plain naive. Moore is popular for the same reason why Salvia Brown has
millions of followers, why religion dominates modern society.until people can start thinking for themselves, USA will never advance.
As someone said, people who do nothing is as guilty as those who commit
crimes.Saddam is a ticking time bomb, anyone who think it's perfectly safe to
leave him to torture people is OK is a fool. As for war, it may be
bad, but it's also the most effective way to end saddam's regime.
Imagine if USA did not drop 2 nuclear bomb in Japan to end the world
war 2, how many more people would have died if Japan decide to assault
US cities.

Michael Moore is the greatest left wing propagandist since Josef
Goebbels. Like him, Mr Moore has no problems twisting facts and
portraying outright lies just to promote his cause.In this movie there are glaring contradictions and several unsupported
"facts" which come at the audience so fast and furious that he does not
even give you the opportunity to think. Of course that is his goal as
it was the goal of his historical forefathers. All he wants is for a
thick cloud of negativity to hang over George W Bush so that you feel -
I just can' trust that guy. Mission accomplished Mr Moore. Keep the
sheep listening.Heil Moore.

This film is the result of a biased mind: this is the reason we'll
always disagree whenever politics is involved.Did Michael Moore lie to the people? Yes. Was he truthful to the people
and to the interviewees? No. We all know how to edit an article to say
what we want it to say. In Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore presented the
materials, interviews in edited forms, according to people who were
interviewed; therefore, Michael's presentation cannot be trusted. If he
seeks to impress people, publish a tabloid. Else, tell the facts in
their complete form, without editing, and let the people make their own
judgment. Don't cheat people out of $10 to watch propaganda, and
exploit their 9/11 emotions.He owes an apology to the victims of 9/11 in the U.S. and to the
families who have sons and daughters serving in the military. He does
not deserve to live in our country if he does not pledge allegiance to
the causes to defend it. His passion, judging from this movie, is with
and for the radical Muslims. I don't trust him.

There used to be something called a "Roast" when people would mock in a
light hearted way the roastee. However, when the goal is the
destruction of the individual, we now call it a documentary. It is
incomplete, well-edited, as biased as possible. It teases with many
interesting connections yet brings none of them to a meaningful point.
It is a collage intended to elect John Kerry (who is any one other than
Bush). While it is easy to find and make fun of Bush et al foibles, it
never even suggests what should have been done. Was Iraq prior to
invasion a human rights nirvana? Does the Supreme Court hold no value
when it goes against Gore et al wants? Most telling would be what was
Michael Moore going when informed of 9/11. Should Moore trump
Bradbury?Can anyone be respected, except for those outraged at
everything since Dec 2000?

This arrogant unkempt slob embodies the caricature of Americans that
the French and other haters of the USA enjoy so much. This is why they
awarded this croc-u-mentary at the Cannes film festival. Hollywood has

Some of the most artful yet shameless propaganda since Baghdad Bob
claimed that the US tanks were not about to roll into Baghdad. The
exploitation of a mother who lost a son is inexcusable. Running audio
only to depict the 9/11 attacks and hearing people ask "what's going
on" was geared to imply that something was being "hidden". Showing
Iraqui kids at play and then showing them in hospitals burned and
maimed looked as if it came right off of Al Jesera. Showing a public
execution in Saudi Arabia (beheading by sword) was uncalled for without
first including WHY this man was being executed. At no time does Moore
show Saddam Hussein harming ANYONE which is patently untrue. Moore
dwells on how Bush "stole the election" and that this was somehow a
racial issue ... including showing in a joint session of Congress how
not one US Senator ... not John Kerry, not Bob Kerry, not even Ted
Kennedy would "come to the defense" of black congressmen. This is
shameful propaganda of the worst sort.

Propaganda film producer Michael Moore has the first amendment right of
freedom of expression. That's the most I can say. Beyond this, he uses
everything from trickery, selective editing, and outright lies to push
forward his political agenda. Mr Moore would not know a true "fact"
when presented with one. He should label his films as what they are -
fiction - rather than as documentaries. In this particular film, Mr Moore uses the tragedy of September 11,
2001 - along with his opinions of the events to push his election-year
agenda. It has been made clear from the past, that he hates President
Bush, and his policies.Anyone with an IQ of 70 or greater is capable of picking through Mr
Moore's film and finding that what he considers "facts" are either
outright lies or manipulated conversations through creative editing. My first suggestion to people considering viewing this would be -
Don't! Don't waste your time on seeing this anti-American propaganda
film, Don't give Mr Moore any more money in his pockets for using the
tragedy of those events to further his agenda. Barring this, however, if you decide you must go, keep in mind that
just because he is a Hollywood millionaire, does NOT mean that he is a
political expert. He does not have the same information that our
elected officials have. Not that he needs it, because he makes up
whatever he is lacking. Keep this in mind. Remember that you have the
power to learn the truth, and just because someone put it on a screen,
does not make it true.This film got big recognition in France, a country that is known for
being against us to begin with 9except when they need us to bail them
out of something). Hopefully, enough people see through Mr Moore's
agenda, and he is financially and professionally "encouraged" to move
to a socialist country like France, in which his political agendas
would be more suited.

Perhaps the most brazenly manipulative cake of lies with a thin coating
of truth I have ever seen. Mr. Moore appears to have lost his way and
taken the pay-off, shamelessly trying to shift blame away from those
ultimately responsible. In time I suspect that his betrayal will be
revealed to all, but not before the hoards of misinformed are scarred
for life. This film is basically a non-linear tossed salad of truth and
lies, an incomprehensible roller-coaster of grotesqueness. For those
that have at least a basic understanding of what really happened on
that fateful day, imagine standing in front of a firing squad with your
eyes taped wide open while your body is fired at with poisonous darts,
for two hours, and you will have a rough sense of what it is like to
watch this film. Conversly, for those that accept the mainstream
media's revisionist version of the truth of 911, prepare to be deeply
insulted and patronized. Now, maybe I have no right to make any of the
above statements, since I walked out about half way through (something
I have never done, I even can sit through Bruckheimer films!), but
judging by the looks on the faces of the crowd as I watched them leave
the theater, walking away from this steaming heap of evil may be the
surest sign of wisdom. My scars are beginning to heal after much time
and several viewings of Alex Jones' "Martial Law 9/11: Rise of the
Police State"...

I find it difficult and futile to do so with such a horrid example of
something that is neither insightful nor objective.Okay, okay, knowing well in advance that objectivity is not part of
Moore's vocabulary, I should not have been surprised by Moore's latest

really believe Moore. Oh Please! For the benefit of my sanity, I must force myself to stop here before

A number of my friends had told me to see F911 for months. One said it
was incredible, and he had a totally different picture of the man he
voted for. He went on to say the movie completely changed his opinion,
and now he was voting for the other guy this Nov. After a sobering conversation with another friend in particular, who
happened to hold a masters' degree in business, I finally saw the
movie.My opinion: Well said, 007-what a crock.One thing I find funny is the hard-line opinion of right-wingers, who
say it's crap without having seen the film. But what absolutely
disgusts me is the stupidity of this new band of Michael
Moore-followers that have seen the movie and have completely swallowed
it without having checked a single fact for themselves.'But what about Rush Limbaugh, etc?' The right may have Rush Limbaugh,
but neither Limbaugh, Hannity, nor O'Reilly ever made a mass-consumable
movie about pres. Clinton, re: White Water, China, or Lewinski. If this
movie holds a single shred of truth, where is the cry for impeachment?
Not even Michael Moore has been able to get a petition for impeachment
to be taken seriously. I never saw Bowling for Columbine, but now Moore's credibility is
absolutely ruined with me. This 'facts' of this 'documentary' are so
over-the-top they would almost read like a comedy, if it weren't for
the shock scenes and crying mothers, I'd almost think the Spinal Tap
guys were behind it. I am absolutely disgusted with this obvious
distortion of facts, and I will never watch another Moore movie.
Hollywood has absolutely disappointed me by continuing to distribute
this film. Just avoid it and do yourself a favor. I feel dumber for
having ever watched it, myself.

This THING (I won't even give it the respect of calling it a film) is
even worse than a Nazi propaganda film. I would rather watch a Nazi
propaganda film than this. The person I went with actually fell asleep
for an hour and when she woke up and asked what she missed I Truthfully
answered "nothing". Moore made a decent film with Bowling For
Columbine; even though I didn't agree with all of it I still felt it
was a powerful film. But this is THE WORST ATTEMPT AT A FILM ever. He
does not schedule meetings with people, he just blindsides them with
stupid comments, and tries to get a reaction, and when they react like
any normal human being does, he acts like it is a disgrace against god.
Moore tries to have the same impact that Bowling did, But it is way
off. It goes randomly from topic to topic, and has Moore's voice
telling us what we should think, rather than showing us with FACTS. I
wish I could give it a Zero rating here but since I can't I will just
give it below. MY RATING: ZERO/10

Sorry to all you Michael Moore fans, among whom I once used to find myself
too. But I have to give up this time: this movie is NOT a masterpiece, and
unlike some of Moores previous films, this one in particular becomes an
embarrassing victim of its own arguments. It presents a lot of peculiar
facts. Of course all those small pieces of reality should make one wonder
what kind of guy the US president actually is. But instead of just showing
the facts, Moore cannot refrain from jumping to conclusions - moreover, he
becomes a simple manipulator just as the man he's chasing. Moore is not a
bad film maker, not at all, this piece is technically candidating for an A+.
But to let the very plot make an over-stating fool of itself, which ALMOST
happens towards the ending of Bowling for Colombine, is a mistake, which
Morre this time he carries out to the bitter end. What a
shame.

It is pure treason to hate and do every thing you can to make others

I'm not sure if any of you had the opportunity of viewing an interview on
NBC of Michael Moore by Katie Couric a couple of weeks ago.It seems Michael Moore doesn't like questions directed at him. It's okay for
him to denigrate another but when simple valid questions about the balance
of his film, he gets overly defensive. Kudos to Katie as a media reporter.I think it is time the Bush family makes a documentary about Moore. After
all, fair is fair. What goes around comes around. Either that or Moore could
star in the next Morgan Spurlock's documentary and perhaps a sequel titled
"SUPER SIZE ME 2," a story about a couch-potato whose opinion we should all
listen to. That, or a tale about a trip between the fridge and the film
editing seat where clips of other people's film shoots are carefully cut to
express a particular view. Don't get mad at this, Mr. Moore. After all, you should support free speech
and respect other people's opinions too. Even though some views are not as
profitable.

If you look up the noun "deceit" in the dictionary, you will find that
the definitions point you to the verb "deceive." According to Webster's
9th New Collegiate Dictionary, the main (non-archaic or obsolete)
definition of "deceive" is "to cause to accept as true or valid what is
false or invalid."Now there are many examples throughout the movie of what I call
MM-Facts, or Michael Moore Facts. MM-Facts are nothing more than
deceitful tidbits designed to lead the useful idiots to pushing his
agenda. Sadly, many "reasonable" people are being led by this man...and
if any of them even checked the truth on half the facts they would see
that Moore is a sham.Here is the first of scores of examples: The film shows CBS and CNN
calling Florida for Al Gore. According to the narrator, 'Then something
called the Fox News Channel called the election in favor of the other
guy.All of a sudden the other networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it
must be true.'We then see NBC anchor Tom Brokaw stating, 'All of us networks made a
mistake and projected Florida in the Al Gore column. It was our
mistake.'Moore thus creates the false impression that the networks withdrew
their claim about Gore winning Florida when they heard that Fox said
that Bush won Florida.In fact, the networks which called Florida for Gore did so early in the
evening-before polls had even closed in the Florida panhandle, which is
part of the Central Time Zone. NBC called Florida for Gore at 7:49:40
p.m., Eastern Time. This was 10 minutes before polls closed in the
Florida panhandle. Thirty seconds later, CBS called Florida for Gore.
And at 7:52 p.m., Fox called Florida for Gore. Moore never lets the
audience know that Fox was among the networks which made the error of
calling Florida for Gore prematurely. Then at 8:02 p.m., ABC called
Florida for Gore. Only ABC had waited until the Florida polls were
closed.At 10:00 p.m., which network took the lead in retracting the premature
Florida result? The first retracting network was CBS, not Fox.Over four hours later, at 2:16 a.m., Fox projected Bush as the Florida
winner, as did all the other networks by 2:20 a.m.CBS had taken the lead in making the erroneous call for Gore, and had
taken the lead in retracting that call. At 3:59 a.m., CBS also took the
lead in retracting the Florida call for Bush. All the other networks,
including Fox, followed the CBS lead within eight minutes. That the
networks arrived at similar conclusions within a short period of time
is not surprising, since they were all using the same data from the
Voter News Service. (Linda Mason, Kathleen Francovic & Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, 'CBS News Coverage of Election Night 2000: Investigation,
Analysis, Recommendations' (CBS News, Jan. 2001), pp. 12-25.)So, how can the cerebral person actually take any of this movie
seriously when it is entirely made up of this type of "fact"? If you
like this movie I recommend other historical fiction like the Patriot,
Braveheart, Nixon, JFK or Ken Burns' Baseball.

Please. I am a card-carrying Democrat, but this movie is just too much
to take. I didn't realize that fabrication of facts was considered
"praise-worthy" journalism. The only "doc" in this documentary is
"doc"tored truths. C'mon, Mr. Moore...do your REALLY expect me to
believe that Osama Bin Laden financed the Bush campaign?? If any of the
allegations in this movie had any truth, then George Bush would have
been impeached two years ago. There are plenty of us who would have
made absolute sure that the man was put in jail for life! I must hand
it to the forces of free speech, though. 50 years ago, this type of
overt, falsified character-assassination would have been considered
treasonous. I celebrate the freedom in this country that gives Michael
Moore the ability to make his movie and sell it. However, I believe
that self-proclaimed journalists have a moral responsibility to put
aside there personal hatred in the name of finding the truth, instead
of putting aside the truth to promote their hatred. Sometimes the truth
may actually change their opinion. Shame on you Michael Moore. You
truly bring shame on us liberals.

that movies like these aren't widely enough accepted. Anyone with
intelligence or wisdom can see that this movie provides definite proof
that the only thing our leaders are after is money and oil. It's proof!
Moore has donated 2/3 of all his proceeds to charity, just to offer
further proof of that his intent is to help, not hinder. This movie
will shake the walls of Washington, to finally put leaders in there who
are sensitive and kind to people of other nations. We now know that
this premise of terrorism and hate of other countries toward us is not

Ya know, Mike Moore was a great documentary filmmaker. Roger & Me and
Bowling for Columbine were personal favorites of mine, and I liked his
TV shows too. So this movie was a really tremendous disappointment. I
went in expecting another great documentary - I thought that the
controversy simply came from the issues themselves, not from the way
the movie was made. I was wrong. Moore makes it pretty clear from the
beginning that the purpose of the movie is not to explore the dangerous
implications of the patriot act, or to investigate the circumstances
and causes of 9/11, but rather to insult George W. Bush. Those other
issues are just to back up this main point - "Bush sucks". The shot of
Moore's first encounter with Bush, where Bush dropped a casual insult
"you ought to get a real job", is the giveaway. This is his answer to
that insult, that's all. We expected more, Mike.

he had with "Roger and Me" (without really pointing out Detroit's true
faults) and parleyed it into a giant soapbox for his views. I'm not a
fan of G.W. Bush, but if anyone changes their mind solely because of
this film, I've a bridge in Brooklyn I'll part with cheap. See this

This movie may be entertaining, but a documentary should be factual
first and entertaining second. In resorting to a fast and loose
approach for the purpose of furthering his own agenda, Michael Moore
has become what he mocks.In addition, I read from an interview with Ray Bradbury that he was not
contacted regarding the unauthorized parody of his title Fahrenheit
451, and is so upset he is planning legal action. I disagree with

someone does a REAL Documentary on Michael Moore and let's see how that
ranks at the Theaters. Someone should edit this movie for content and
mark where the truth and the lies are then it might be worth watching

Michael Moore does the same thing as the Bush administration, he takes
the facts and sets them to his own use.But if you start counting the real number of facts used, the count
turns out very low. He tries to influence the public with a number of
interviews that are trying to touch the emotions of the viewer, rather
than the reason.I'm not saying he's wrong and I'm certainly not supporting Bush and his
illegal invasion in Iraq, but Moore has missed a chance here.If he had just stayed with a pure documentary and made use of only
facts (and all the facts, not just the ones that speak in his favour),
he could have buried Bush's foreign policy.Now, no intelligent viewer will fall into the trap Moore has laid out
for them...

This film has clearly provoked strong reactions and that is a very
positive thing. It has also helped break down some of the political
apathy that plagues the West. Another positive thing. However, as a
documentary it resorts to bludgeoning its viewers with its ideology
rather than advocating for it and that I found hard to swallow. I have
enjoyed Moore's efforts being a fan of the Awful Truth and even finding
Bowling for Columbine thought-provoking but there were too many
strained conclusions in this movie for me to not rebel. There were
probably three key points that nauseated me: 1) It assumed its audience
would be basically ignorant of most of its key premises (or possible
alternative facts and hence conclusions), 2) It drew the worse possible
conclusions from the facts available or the conclusion most suggestive
of Bush family incompetence or conspiracy, and 3) It was definitely not
above using its subjects in the worse possible way either to be held up
to ridicule or manipulated for its own purposes. One key example - the
Bushes are responsible for special treatment of Saudi Arabia... The US
and the Saudis have had a close relationship for decades and Saudi
Arabia has long been seen as one of the few Allies the US has in the
Middle East. This is a relationship which has been extremely valuable
to the US and will continue to be, regardless of the President of the
moment. The Wahabist involvement in terrorism is well-known as is the
funding coming out of Saudi however, that doesn't change the
fundamental state relationships. That it got a rousing ovation at
Cannes is certainly no surprise - it played right up to the prejudices
of the Europeans and Hollywood's liberal luminaries. Some interesting
and important points could have been made in this film - it is just a
shame they weren't. As propaganda this film was highly successful, as a
piece of advocacy it was sadly lacking.

This movie is nothing but falsehoods by a lame film producer trying to
push his own political agenda. Isn't it amazing that if Michael Moore
isn't trying expose something he is tying to tear at your heartstrings
with what is wrong with America...example Bowling for Columbine. Why
does his ugly mug have to be on the cover & movie posters of all his
films? He isn't a movie star although he is now trying to be. Get this
guy out of the camera and off my TV screen as well. He showed his true
low class self by attending the G.O.P convention. Just what is this guy
trying to prove, that he is as obnoxious as he is fat and ugly? Now he
is trying to go after the pharmaceutical companies..maybe he can try
using a little bit of the truth..nah that won't happen, he'll fabricate
everything he can as he did in this film.

To call this a "documentary" is an insult to Robert Flaherty("Nanook of the North," "Man of Aran," "Louisiana Story"), PerLorentz ("The Plow That Broke the Plains," "The River"), and BasilWright ("Night Mail").  Michael Moore is a Yasser-Arafat-lookalikewho claims to empathize with "the little people," but who actuallyuses his "Candid Camera" stunts to express his sneeringcondescension toward the American "common man."  We need asatirist on a par with Preston Sturges to skewer Moore'sself-importance and the faddish approval bestowed upon him bythe  glitterati who wallow in Stalinist nostalgia.  By the way, I am anIndividualist-Anarchist in the nonviolent tradition of Montaigne,Henry David Thoreau, Dwight Macdonald & James T. Farrell -- so Idid not vote for Bush.

One of the basic lessons one learns in English class is how to
effectively create a persuasive essay in order to clearly articulate
one's point. When one looks at the work of Michael Moore as an essay,
it appears that he never learned that lesson. His films not only lack a
clear thesis, but they also rely upon faulty information in order to
try and create a picture Moore wants to present. However, in the end,
Moore's films are not works of art. Instead, they are just angry rants
like the ones on an internet message board. This was shown with the
unclear portrait painted in 2002's 'Bowling for Columbine,' and it is
shown again in Moore's film, 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a
film not only made up of the already refuted claims of the far left,
but it also lacks a clear thesis, only relying on the 'evil and
incompetent' persona of George W. Bush to tie the film together which
results in a poorly made finished product. Moore's film touches on several issues the angry left has levied
against the Bush administration over the past four years, many with
little basis in fact. His technique is to pile these accusations
together mixing them in the film, confusing the viewer as how they are
linked together. Moore goes from point to point, lacking clear
transition and failing to develop a thesis. The points Moore has are
these:1. Bush was falsely elected. 2. Bush did nothing more than vacation
before the attacks on September 11th, not preparing at all for the
possibility of terrorist attacks. 3. Once the attacks occurred, Bush
waited to respond in Afghanistan because he had an army buddy who, back
in the 1970s did business with the bin Laden family. In addition to
that, Bush's father, as a private citizen, worked extensively in Saudi
Arabia for the Carlyle Group. 4. Bush reacted too soon in Afghanistan
because American business interests wanted to build a natural gas
pipeline across Afghanistan. 5. After the attacks on September 11th,
Bush prepared the public too much for the possibility of terrorist
attacks. 6. America ended the peaceful regime of President Saddam
Hussein in search of more oil for Bush's buddies. 7. To invade Iraq,
Bush turned young, poor Americans looking for easy money and an
education into death squads, massacring Iraq's civilian population.A well-formed documentary would use such 'facts' as puzzle pieces and
form a complete picture with them to suit the director's need. Moore
fails to do this. Moore, at the beginning of the film, paints Bush as
an incompetent and corrupt man unfit to be president. The rest of the
film is just repetitive. He just states his point in different ways
with different 'facts.' He never completely develops the 'facts' he
finds. Instead, he just goes into them enough to bash Bush, and then
moves on to go after Bush some more.This was the same problem with 'Bowling for Columbine.' I left that
film feeling it was randomly put together to show the audience that the
problem with gun violence in America is complicated and there are no
easy answers. One could blame gun violence on bowling as easily as on
rock music or on lax gun control laws. However, after watching '9/11' I
realized that the lack of a coherent point is just a common flaw in the
work of Moore. In 'Columbine,' Moore pointed to a variety of possible
causes for gun violence, but he never settled on one. The same is true
with '9/11.' What is the effectiveness to show Bush's distant ties to
members of the bin Laden family? Does Moore want to say that bin Laden
and Bush were working on September 11th together? Why did Moore discuss
a natural gas pipeline across Afghanistan? Does he want to say that
Bush was counting on bin Laden to bomb the United States so that he
would have the justification to invade Afghanistan so US companies
could build such a pipeline? These and other points are just left
hanging. Moore does not have a thesis other than 'Bush is stupid,
corrupt, and evil.' This does not work. He needs something more, but he
does not have anything else.Now, if Moore's 'documentary' stated that there was a large scale
conspiracy involving the Bush administration, bin Laden, and the oil
companies, he would have succeeded in making an untrue, yet a well-made
film. Instead, Moore gathers random puzzle pieces filled with
half-truths and speculation together and does not make a coherent
picture with them. It feels like a half-finished film. Where is Moore
going with the film? What is his point? Does he have a developed
thesis? It appears that he does not. If this film actually had a
thesis, it would be more successful. The 'facts' that Moore presents are based more on speculation than
anything else. For example, he often narrates over George W. Bush,
telling the viewer what the president is likely thinking. Is he
thinking what Moore is saying? Probably not. Only someone as creative
as Michael Moore would state that Bush is thinking about a National
Guard buddy he had thirty years before who had business ties with the
bin Laden family. For some of the more ludicrous claims, such as the before mentioned
ties to Saudi Arabia and the bin Laden family, Moore spends a good
portion of time, trying to make the accusation creditable, but only
succeeds to criticize Bush for the distant ties to Saudi Arabian
royalty and the bin Laden family. Remember, this is at the same time he
is condemning the Bush administration for saying there were ties
between Iraq and Al Qaida. It is interesting to note that the ties
between Saddam and bin Laden are much easier to find than the ties
between Bush and Osama. Another large part of Moore's film is that the Bush administration has
created a 'climate of fear' with the American public, constantly
warning them about the possibility of further terrorist attacks. As a
viewer of this film, I asked, 'Now Moore is bashing the Bush
administration for warning the public about the possibility of
terrorist attacks? Was he not just bashing the Bush administration for
not vigilant about the possibility of terrorist attacks? Moore has many
such contradictions in his film.When Moore lacks facts in this film, he turns to personal testimonies.
He finds one woman in Flint, Michigan who lost her son in Operation
Iraqi Freedom and is now against the war. This woman is seen in four
different segments of the film, only twice being identified as the
mother of a fallen soldier. In all four of these segments, she is
wearing different articles of clothing. To an untrained observer, one
might think there are three women. That is just an example of the type
of trickery Moore utilizes in this film.The sad part about this film is all the hatred that Moore directs at
Bush. One scene, near the end of the film, shows this very well. The
woman mentioned above goes to Washington to go to the White House. She
talks to an Iraqi protester who states that Bush has killed his
countrymen. She then answers that Bush killed her son, too. That is
what Moore is trying to say throughout the film: Bush is responsible
for all the deaths since 9/11 due to his greed. However, Moore knows,
like everyone knows, that Bush is the wrong target for such
accusations. Moore's film tries to make the target in this war a
domestic one. Like many liberals, Moore has been against Bush since
before day one. He does not care who succeeds in the War on Terror as
long as it is not Bush. This is not the way we need to be in America.
We should be able to criticize our leaders, but not to wage battle
against them like Moore is doing in this film. Moore needs to turn his
attention to the true enemies of September 11, 2001, not attack the man
who has the most difficult job in the post-9/11 world.However, Michael Moore has made a film meant to attack not Osama bin
Laden, but President George W. Bush. His film, Fahrenheit 9/11, is
trying to convince the public not to reelect George W. Bush. However,
it is not complete. It only gathers together speculation and hearsay,
never creating a coherent work on why to oppose the reelection of
President George W. Bush. There is no guide- no thesis- to show how
these puzzle pieces Moore has gathered fit together. I wish that there
was a deeper meaning to this film, something that was worth the hype,
but there is not. The film is just like a poorly-written essay by a
member of the angry left about the past four years. There is nothing in
the film that conspiracy theorists have not heard before and that has
not already been debunked by others. The film is not only out of date
but is also poorly constructed. If this type of propaganda is the best
the liberals can produce, I say, 'Bring it on.'

There is a lot of truth in Michael Moore's film.  During its first eight
months, the Bush administration did ignore the threat of terrorism.  They
have been protective of Saudis involved with extremists.  And the war in
Iraq not only had little to do with terrorism, but it actually interfered
with the war on terrorism by diverting resources.However, Moore does so much grandstanding going for the cheap laugh that he
damages his own credibility.  Moore seems to put entertainment before
informing, which is why `Fahrenheit 9/11' is something less than a good
film.  While it may cause many to justly question the Bush administration's
policies, this movie will also mislead many viewers into thinking this is
what a well made documentary looks like -- and `Fahrenheit 9/11' is nothing
like a well made documentary.

Michael Moore would take ANY piece of film and use it against Bush.
What's next? He'll probably show a clip of Spongebob Squarepants and
claim that it's a right wing propaganda piece to encourage polluting
the seas with sponges and pineapples. Film should be about art and
storytelling, not about propaganda.Journalist Christopher Hitchens has written a very insightful piece
that really grasps the inadequacies of Michael Moore's offering. Whether you place yourself on the left or the right of the political
spectrum, do not go see this movie. Do not buy it. Do not rent it.
Michael Moore is only doing favors for his bank account and a
disservice to America.The only people that will be fooled by Moore are the socially and
politically uneducated and undereducated who are gullible enough to
believe anything they see or hear.

First off, you see the agenda being pushed here. As a documentary it is
horrible, for it only showing one side. This tactic is something that
Mr. Moore has a history of doing. A Good Documentary should show both
sides of this puzzle. But the funniest thing about Moore is that he is
battering a individual who is trying to give the people of Iraq the
same rights and privileges as Mr. Moore in this country. And at the
times we are in it makes me appalled that Americans are believing this
nonsense that this is a war to protect Bush Family Secrets and
investments. I am sure that Mr. Moore knows that there are plenty of
good reasons that this is war is happening. Why should he know? He
enjoys all the freedoms we have everyday.Don't get me wrong, he is a good director. He is just not a good
author.

After sitting through this extra-ordinarily boring documentary, I have
a little better insight as to how our society really is. Apparently
wars aren't meant to be won, Bush invaded Iraq to make him and his
friends rich, and the small town of Flint has a surprisingly high number
of armed forces recruiters for its size. I had no idea. Michael Moore starts off saying the election was a sham, and that Gore
really won. He failed to mention all the uncounted servicemen votes
that were overseas (that were strongly in favor of Bush). And wasn't it
Al Gore himself gaveling those "minorities" into silence in the
joint-congress? I must say I didn't understand many points he tried to
make in the film. Most of it was boring rambling about over-hashed
topics.I must say, however, that I enjoyed seeing the brush-off he received
from all those senators. They know to avoid him because he will take
their comments and edit them into submission.I don't like a lot of aspects of this war, but there has never been a
war that I did like every aspect of. War sucks, but is sometimes
necessary. I've spoken to numerous people that actually served in Iraq
and Afghanistan, and they all tell me they need to be there. They
support the President, the war, and their leaders. Michael Moore hates America. He's not a terrorist, but he is supporting
them indirectly by undermining the very effort to rid the world of
them.I don't have room for a point-by-point dispute about this film, so I'll
just finish by saying everyone should see it, just so they can see how
poorly this documentary was made. It had no tied ends, and had no real
point. It reminded me of Bowling for Columbine -- One big massive
effort to push his own political agenda. It won't work. Americans are
too smart to be fooled by this transparent ploy. I must say to Michael, however, that he mastered the press on getting
free publicity by "suddenly" realizing Miramax wouldn't do the film...
a full year after the fact. Oh - and pleading for a PG-13 rating, while
leaving occurrences of the F word and some extreme violence in, all of
which were pointless... that was a great way to get attention too. Good
job Michael.

If you hate G.W.Bush, run to go see this film. It'll get your left wing
juices flowing 
and you'll leave the theatre all aglow. If you have half a brain and you're
not a 
rabid liberal conspiracy theorist, don't waste your time. Moore is a
propagandist, 
pure and simple and he makes films to push a political agenda. I guess
there's 
nothing wrong with that except for the fact that the liberals have a
monopoly on 
Hollywood and television, so you'll never get to see the equivalent film
from a 
conservative film maker.It would take way more space than I have here to point out all the lies,innuendos and half truths this movies consists of, so I'll just point out
one that 
was particularly glaring. Richard Clarke is now the left's darling after his
book 
and testimony at the 9/11 hearings. Moore suggests some vast Bush/Saudiconspiracy by pointing out that members of BinLaden's family were allowed toleave Boston after the attack...guess who made that decision all by
himself...you 
got it...Richard Clarke. Michael sort of 'forgets' to tell you
that.

I was extremely disappointed on viewing this film. As a frame of
reference, I have seen Moore's earlier film ROGER & ME and this film
does not compare to it in a list of ways. Where Roger & Me is
intelligent, this effort is like Moore being on Crystal Meth when he
wrote the script. His teeth & cutting edge appear to have rotted.Roger & Me contained factual & balanced content. Fahrenheit 9/11
contains little fact & no balance within it's content. Roger & Me
actually took a subject & made sense in addressing it. Fahrenheit 9/11
takes a subject (BUSH) & attempts to smear it using political innuendo.Roger & Me has a lot of great humor within the film along with it's
valid criticisms of what happened in Flint, Michigan. Fahrenheit 9/11
has a little humor, but tends to be "preaching to the church
choir(Democrats)" in order to achieve those laughs. That is the
definition of cheap humor. The reference to Flint, Michigan in Fahrenheit 9/11 is an interesting
picture, but it is the same picture that was in ROGER & ME and yet
Moore is trying to blame the current President for past events. The
reason for that is obvious, it was the Democrats & Clinton who voted
for NAFTA & GAAT which are 2 of the reasons Flint still looks like a
bombed out city now. All of Flint's problems really began with the 1986
Federal Tax law changes, & even Moore isn't smart enough to know that. Moore is a talented film maker. Unfortunately, his paranoid agenda
ruins this effort. It is a shame to see this decline. Moore obviously
made this film to make money. It is a shame to see him sell out to make
a quick cheap buck, but that is what happened with this movie. He has
lost touch with original skill used in making earlier movie.

Oh Mr. Moore, you sure know how to splice dice and spin the truth to
your pleasing, its true, this movie makes some valid points, but at the
expense of truth. This movie should not be called a documentary, for
the simple fact that documentaries by nature are supposed to be
impartial, and this movie is by no stretch of the imagination that. yes
big mistakes were made by the Bush administration, but my griff isn't
with the political views Moore takes in this movie, its with the the
way he presents them, if your going to make a documentary, then make a
DOCUMENTARY, not a journey into the mind of yourself, he promotes
people to make up their own mind, and yet he plasters images of deceit
and half truths in front of them on the big screen all depicting his
radical left wing views in a extremely slanted way, and then expects
the same mindless cant think for themselves Americans to come out of
the theater with there own opinions, not likely. Not saying that all
Americans are mindless, but when presented propaganda like Moores new
slanted so called documentary, chances are a good lot of the people who
watched it are going come out with Moores political views and not their
own. so whos the winner here? well its Moore, my moneys on this movie
topping 75 million and Moore laughs his fat ass all the way to the
bank, all the while the sheep of America praising him for his service
to the middle class blue collar American people. Moore; go (explotive

This movie is anti-Bush propaganda. Michael Moore is out to bash just
to make some cash. I saw this movie in the movie theaters and I had to
leave because I was laughing so severely. I understand that nobody
wants to see or find out that the person they loved has died, but
seriously, going around asking politicians if they have family in the
war? How many of us actually have family overseas fighting for this
country? Many of you probably do not have immediate family in the war.
Anybody who if overseas right now didn't even get drafted- they
enlisted. Please, don't see this movie unless you are a left-wing
extremist. And if you aren't and you still see it, just think of how
much money Mr. Moore has made off of something that cost him very
little to make and took him very little to think through. Michael Moore
is a negative, unhappy person who only feels decent by tearing other
people down.

Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine was great. What is this? Moore,
who explains that he likes facts and hates "living in fictitious times
where fictitious results elect a fictitious president." Take a look in
the mirror, pal. Michael Moore's entire documentary is false. And what
kills me is that liberals are dumb enough to believe it. At least Bush
was elected for a second term. If you want my reasoning, read all the
articles at www.moorelies.com, including War, Lies, and Videotape or
read all the books that are out that have clear sources to the
evidence. In short, Moore lies, deceives, edits out, and avoids things
in order to trick you. At the beginning, you see Gore during the 2000
election with a sign behind him saying Florida VICTORY. Moore than
dares to say that the election had been stolen from the dems. Excuse
me, Bush won the electorate fair and square and secondly, the footage
shown takes place before election night- Moore is already deceiving us.
He shows us images of fake newspapers that were clearly made up if you
carefully examine and he shows clips and interprets them negatively
without showing the whole footage which would twist his very words if
he did. I could go on and on about his deception- jees, no wonder he
never has the balls to debate with conservative republicans who can
tear down his documentary in nothing flat. If you wish to see it, be
skeptical- maybe all of the "documentary" is false. Miserable 1/10.

Bowling for Columbine was somewhat careless and at times bordered on
left-wing propaganda although overall it had an intelligent and
thoughtful message, but this new film makes no bones about its outward
sole intention of attacking the Bush administration. Now don't
misunderstand me, I believe that Bush is a cynical, manipulative,
lying, self-serving and incompetent President, but I don't think that
Michael Moore's particular brand of self aggrandisement does anything
to discredit Bush - if anything it discredits his opponents by
association.Moore's "discoveries" about Bush and the aftermath of September the
11th are fairly uninteresting to be honest and his conclusions are
clearly flawed and in fact play directly to that race-baiting culture
which Moore claims to hate. It is however interesting and at least
pretends to be a piece of interesting creative journalism. The second half is nowhere near as instructive, informative or
tasteful. Shocking shots of dead children and mangled soldiers are
overlaid with Moore's particular brand of commentary, which varies from
the coldly snide to the openly vitriolic. Interviews with surprisingly
ignorant soldiers are tempered by the realisation that all of these men
are in fact low-ranking teenagers, and their opinions tell you nothing
about the overall war in Iraq (and they probably aren't that
representative anyway). Finally we finish, as Moore loves to, with a
loud, obnoxious rant, in which we see a grieving mother splashed across
the scene as Moore yells at passing politicians, and various obnoxious
and irrelevant people interrupt the overblown sequence. You do feel
sorry for the mother, but mainly because Michael Moore won't leave her
alone. This is trashy and thoughtless, it came out too early to cover the
incredible and appalling Abu Graib atrocities or the official reports
into the blatant lies that were told about WMDs or Saddam's "links"
with Al Quaeda and in my opinion, discredits Moore more than it does
Bush, a sad follow up to the promising Bowling for Columbine.

The most terrible movie that I have seen this year. Even though I
consider myself an independent voter, just seeing this tripe would make
me want to immediately discredit any person who Moore supports. We have
not seen propaganda like this since the Nazi's produced brainwashing
films for their own country. Yes there is a grain of truth included in
the smoke that Michael Moore blows, yet it is so shrouded with biased
opinions, one-sided arguments and ridiculous claims. I give the man
credit for this film, he does have talent for a great fiction that I
did have a good laugh at, and it did make me think. However, the movie
was portrayed as a documentary when in actuality none of the video
footage was supported by a source, many of the people interviewed were
all of one opinion and it was definitely biased. So as a documentary, it is terrible and fails at all of the
qualifications. As a fiction that made me think and laugh, I applaud.

I personally think Micheal Moore is an ignorant bias blind and one
sided man who is looking to make a quick dollar on our Nation's
Tragedy. I think It's funny how in order to argue his point he has to
cut and edit film footage to make it seem like his theories and
supposed "hardcore facts" are some what worth the time to listen to. If
you are going to argue a point don't take bits and pieces of something
to form your opinion. I am also sick everyone saying Bush hates black
people. not everything is a race issue. If I'm cut in front of in a
line its not because of my skin color, religion, etc. Its the
organizations responsible and Bush is just an easy scapegoat for the
problems. Its the government in the gulf coast that controls what
happens and the procedures. This is another tragedy for our nation and
once again people are looking for an easy blame, and the easiest is to
point to the leader of the United States. I'm proud I'm American and I
would rather have Bush be President and go to war then have Kerry be
President and let the Middle East walk all over us. America wasn't born
on the fundamentals of a pacifist, we will take you down for any reason
if you try to attack America in any way shape or form, America was
built on sacrifice and the lives of soldiers in EVERY war, and should
not be disgraced by those that don't "support the war" you don't need
to support the cause, but you better support the troops, there out
there for you, GOD BLESS America!-Meghann

Having not seen this film till now, I was surprised at how poor it is,
given the praise heaped on it (not least at the Cannes festival). Moore
has some very good points to make, and the daily evidence from post-war
Iraq only serves to reinforce the main thrust of the anti-invasion
argument, but much of them are lost in a welter of trivia and
scatter-gun diatribe.Yes, Bush is a fool, but it's all too easy to make a fool look foolish.
Yes, the connection made between Saddam and Osama was and is false, but
jump-cut editing from one to the other is not the same as a
counter-argument. Yes, the election was fraudulent, but presidents
should be judged on their actions after taking office, and the stable
door is now firmly bolted. By mixing serious points on these issues
with frivolous ones, such as the allowing of matches and lighters on
planes, Moore dilutes his main points and provides his detractors with
ammunition. And by his unforgivable manipulation of the relatives of
9/11 and Iraq fatalities (whose permission he may not have sought), his
distorted references to pre-invasion Iraq (which didn't invade or
threaten America, but most certainly invaded Kuwait), his selection
(and manipulation without permission of the victims ?) of tragic war
footage, he, like his very target, turns truth into propaganda. What is
comedy footage of national stereotypes (e.g. Iceland, and omitting
Britain) doing in a serious stance on one-sided war alliances ?Way, way better (and refused by the American networks - what a
surprise) is Adam Curtis's documentary series The Power of Nightmares,
which ran on BBC Channel 2 in late 2004 and early 2005 but is due on
DVD - see IMDb pages and
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4171213.stm (last amended
January 2005). This is everything Moore's film should have been, a
coherent and evidence-based argument against a myth of global terrorism
which is responsible for everything post-9/11. Curtis's view is that
there is a threat from Islamic and other terrorist cells and groups,
but that there is no network of organised anti-western interests (from
al-Qaeda or elsewhere), and that Bush has used this 'politically driven
fantasy' to justify Iraq, Guantánamo Bay and all the rest. This series
is, I believe, is worth ten of Mr Moore's piece, and should be seen by
everyone in the US and UK administrations. BAFTA awards surely will
follow*, hopefully igniting fresh interest from non-UK media.Michael Moore now has everything to do to make up for his lapse.
Perhaps the reason for his film's success is that anything critical of
Bush and the new fundamentalism is viewed as more subversive and
anti-US than it is. The tragedy is that while Moore has been fully
vindicated by events since this film was made, (so we are told) 50% of
Americans still believe that Saddam, and not the Saudis and Pakistan,
were behind 9/11. For Moore see Curtis, and soon, please.* BAFTA for Best Factual Series, April 2005.

Anyways so today I go with my cousin Chris to go watch Fahrenheit 9/11.
I didn't want to see this crap *ahem, movie, but since I had to write a
paper for it for my anthropology class, I decided to go. Let me just
tell you that this film aroused passions in me that I didn't even know
existed. First of all let me say this is an extremely important film,
and it is the duty of all patriotic Americans to go watch this movie to
see what the media muckrackers of the left are planning to conjure up
next to sway the public opinion of many feeble-minded Americans.
Anyways, I could honestly say that this is the biggest example of
Yellow Journalism in the 21st century.Although many of the stories are true, the opinions are all Michael
Moore's opinions and all his opinions are sadly misrepresented. First
of all he shows our nations president, George W. Bush, as an
incompetent, greedy, self-centered imbecile who doesn't give a damn
about the United States, and get this Bush was actually friends with
Osama Bin Laden!!! WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSH*T!!! THIS MOORE HAS SOME
NERVE! Well all I can say is that his criticisms of the Bush
Administration in his documentary is the truth was exaggerated and some
of the stuff that he talked about was purely fiction! The part that
upset me the most is how he compared the Iraq war with the war in
Vietnam and how he said the Iraq War is worst than Vietnam, First of
all let me get this one thing straight 55,000 Americans died in Vietnam
because of a war that was caused by democrats, JFK and LBJ as the main
factors, In the Iraq War of 2003-2004 only 600 Americans have died and
we have won this war as well! AS A MATTER OF FACT ALL WARS HAVE BEEN
CAUSED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE 20th CENTURY, with exception of Bush senior
in 1991 with desert storm and that wasn't even a war, that was an
police action! Anyways I all I wanna say is that Michael Moore is a man
who wields extraordinary power over the minds of ignorant feeble-minded
Americans who come to watch his movie, his weapons of course are his
camera and his entertaining and comical style of production. He is also
a man who self-proclaims himself as a defender of the underprivileged
and the urban poor when he himself is a millionaire and stands to make
substantial profit with this movie and get this he makes over $30,000 a
speech when he talks at various colleges around the country. He
degrades our armed forces in this film as well and den lifts the army
back up when he interviews Mrs. Lipscomb (who lost a son in Iraq) this
sort of inconsistency in his movies just displays the level of
hypocrisy this man has. This film made me realize not to hate Bush and
his administration , as Moore surely intended me to do, but to hate
Moore and his blatant lies and his perverse vision of America. I also realized that Moore is a very powerful man and he will persuade
many ppl to go against this great government because of his movie
making skills and his entertainment skills, But he is the biggest
Muckracker, Yellow Journalist there is out there and he is a Media
Darling! Hah! Funny his core supporters are college students, HAH, Mr.
Moore I laugh at your face, I am a college student, I am a minority, I
am also an American who refuses to play your mind games and refuses to
drown in your liberal hypocrisy!!! Anyways, Go watch that piece of
leftist crap Farenheight 9-11 see if your one of the weak minded or one
of the stronger minded. God Bless! Bush 2004! Supramaxx Rating 1/10

I you got 100 left wing conspiracy theorists, looked them in a room for
a few days, and asked them to make a movie this is what they would
produce.Its a movie that preaches to the converted, the hard left. others in
the centre or centre right or left with half a brain will see straight
thru the narrative of movie with little effort, but that in itself does
not make it a bad movie, and I am not saying its a bad movie.I wrote a thesis on Leni Riefenstahl many years ago, and have seen most
of her work, and this is the closest I have seen to it in modern
cinema. Moores 9/11 is classic Leni Riefenstahl, stunningly put
together with skilled editing and haunting soundtrack and totally
devoid of truth and accountability. and like Leni Riefenstahl 9/11 is
very unnerving to watch.So I hope you can sleep easy with yourself Micheal, to have your work
compared to one of the most infamous movie makers of all times, the
Nazis female god moviemaker Leni Riefenstahl, sleep easy my friend,
truth is a stubborn thing.

It amazes me as to much the liberals hate to not have power that they
totally discount all of the good that we've done in the Middle East.
They're so quick to make it seem as if President George W. Bush is
trying to kill American soldiers. You'd think after what happened to
those children in Russia that they would wake up and take action
towards terrorism. I'm proud of our country and our president because
he has BALLS! It is truly so sick of someone to think it is funny to
attack your leader like this waste of skin Michael Moore has done. I do
believe in freedom of speech as we are all entitled to our own
opinions, but liberals don't seem to understand that its things like
that this which will begin civil wars. We need no love one another, not
hate.B P.S. Can't wait till November

This has to be the most ridiculous compilation of half-truths and lies
I have ever seen in my life. People want to believe what he is saying,
so they will. Unfortunately, liberals are all about things being
perfect now, no matter what it might cost their children. Take Clinton
for example. He was a genius at the game of covering the big picture
up, and blinding America with half-decent short-run economical
decisions, which in the long run ran our economy down the drain. By the
way, if you think a man who can sit in front of the entire country and
lie to our faces about the Lewinsky thing, is fit to be our president,
then god help you. It's not the fact that he got a bj, its the fact
that he lied to America's face about it. If he could lie about that,
think how many other issues he lied to your face about!! I'm not saying
that Bush is the perfect president in any way, just that his decisions
are going to benefit the world down the line, as opposed to Carey's
lies and the way Carey flip-flops on every single issue, which may,
like Clinton's presidency, look pretty good at the time, when hes out
of there this country will be less than it was when he entered the
presidency. A few weeks ago Senator Carey had been lobbying a bill that
HE PROPOSED HIMSELF, and decided that it would be an inconvenience for
him to vote that day; his bill got shot down by one vote. Is this the
man you want making your decisions? Not me. OK I'll mention a few things from this "documentary". So Moore is
trying to connect the Bush family with the Bin Laden family. HE FORGOT
TO MENTION THAT THE BIN LADEN FAMILY DISOWNED OSAMA. There are over 100
Bin Ladens over the world, who share Osama's blood, and of course Bush
is going to talk to them and clear them out of the country. Where else
would you start when trying to track a person down? His family maybe?
So now you have Osama's family helping America to track him down and
kill him, don't you think your going to protect these people? I'm sure
if I was a bouncer at a club on 9/11 and I saw an ID that says Bin
Laden on it, I wouldn't have let that person leave with their life, and
neither would the 50 other Americans standing around me. Point being,
Mrs. Moore only told you what he wanted to, which was what you wanted
to hear, and that was far from the truth. Even the EXTREMELY liberal
News group, CBS or NBC, I can't remember which one exactly, agrees with
me, that this movie is too much of a blatant lie and it might backfire
in Moore's face, causing Carey to loose more votes than he gains. I know that the movie in no way endorses Carey, but you have to be one
ignorant person to think Moore had intentions otherwise. To all the
people making noise about his speech to the "elite", what else is he
supposed to say to these people?! "I'm sorry fellas, I'm going to have
to raise your income tax 20% to help cover all of the people who can't
find time to get a job, they need more money than they could earn at
full-time minimum wage, uh, sorry I can't help you out, don't vote for
me." Is that what he was supposed to say? Thats what Carey would be
saying. America was built around capitalism, but there seems to be more
and more of a liberal push to socialism. I don't want to be paying all
of the worthless people who would rather stand in line at the welfare
office than go to work every day. I want to spend the money I EARN on
things that I WANT. Not on drug addictions of others. America needs to
wake up, because if things keep heading in the direction that they're
going, there will be another Civil War. One last thing...remember how
much Moore hates guns from Bownling for Columbine? Well he has armed
body guards with him at all times. If we lived in Michael Moore's
world, his body guards would be handing out flowers, and Moore would be
shot dead with an illegal gun. A gun in good hands (i.e. a LEGAL gun)
counters a gun in bad hands (i.e. an ILLEGAL gun). If there were no
legal guns America would be like the state of Maryland, people held at
gunpoint and walked to ATMs, people ringing your doorbell and robbing
you like that, shootings left and right...just think about it please.

John McCain speaks truth. I sat through this garbage only to know that
the end result would be a deeper hatred for Michael Moore and his
incorrect politics. He puts a face on liberalism that says "I forgot to
shave, and, oh yeah, shower." Excrement.Nothing about this film is rewarding, except maybe seeing Moore wallow
in his own lack of knowledge. If you want entertaining journalism,
watch the Daily Show or read the book "Michael Moore is a Big Fat
Stupid White Man". This is trash.If Bush is wrong and you are right, Mr. Moore, run in '08. Call it
partisan, but I don't quite think you'll garner more votes than people
with EDUCATION and SKILL.

Greetings from the darkness. I have commented on this despicable,
loathsome, atrocious piece of garbage several times, and now after
viewing it several times since my last review, I feel compelled to
share how I really feel about "Fahrenheit 9/11", Michael Moore's
vicious, deceitful "pack of lies" which sought to unseat our president,
a man whom I (mostly) hold some of the highest regards for, and who is
sorely and evilly misrepresented in this abomination of a
"documentary". I would just like to entertain to anyone who actually
believes that every detail in this "film" is irrefutable and merely
"exposing the truth", to visit some of the countless websites laden
with pages and pages of information of Moore's innumerable deceits,
distortions, and "cut-and-paste" tactics throughout "Fahrenheit
9/11"... can you say... Centigrade 9-11? After borrowing the DVD of
this despicable film and viewing it in the solitude of my own home, not
surrounded by the poor, ignorant souls who so shamelessly praise all of
Moore's "patriotic endeavors" that accompanied me in the theater (free
admission) months ago, I came to really understanding how people who
haven't a shred of an idea about the affairs of the world as well as
the history that has advanced those affairs, might be inclined to
believe that George W. Bush is a sordid, avaricious, contemptible,
bumbling fool, who merely "stole" the 2000 election, concocted the
worst terrorist attack on our nation's soil for political and financial
gain, and endeavored into Iraq in "fooling" America that it posed a
threat when, to quote the brilliant Jim McDermott, "There wasn't one".
I would just like to share a few of the many, many, many deceits Moore
has so insidiously crafted throughout "Fahrenheit 9/11", so that some
of "the truth" might be exposed: The only reason released National
Guard records showed James Bath's name blotted out was because Federal
Law requires the National Guard to black out the names of any Guardsmen
whose medical information was on the same pages as the records with
which the Guard releasing Bush's health records- these privacy
regulations were only enacted in April 2003, before Moore's "surprise"
National Guard copy; Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia has been a
bipartisan power-broker for decades, and President Clinton himself
repeatedly relied on Bandar to advance his own Middle East agenda;
Taliban officials came to Texas in 1997, yet what Moore neglects to
tell us is that Bush never even conferred with them; Oregon State
Police (and thus Oregon State government) is strictly responsible for
its security; Saddam Hussein did order the murder of Americans, for
example: he permitted Abu Nadal a safe haven, funded suicide bombers in
Israel who killed Americans, and ordered in 1991 the assassination of
the American Ambassador to the Phillipines; Iraqi intelligence
documents from 1992 list bin Laden as an Iraqi intelligence asset; the
enormous "defense budget cut" Moore indicts the Bush administration was
held over from the Clinton administration, Bush being powerless until
the following year to reverse it; 33% cut in military salary? try not
initially supporting a special increase bonus of $75, but then changing
positions and advocating the bonus; Moore has ZERO evidence that Bush
did not view the Aug. 6, 2001 terrorism briefing; Bush on vacation 42%
of first eight months in office? try meeting with leaders and traveling
across the nation in giving initiatives, briefing on the budget,
meeting with foreign leaders (e.g. Tony Blair), which, if you detract
weekends, which Presidents typically spend in Camp David to work on
initiatives, accounts to only 13% time on "vacation"!; and on and on
and on... Not to mention some of Moore's horrendous hypocrises:
"praising" our troops and mourning their losses? Ha! Here's a guy that
openly proclaimed on his website: "The Iraqis who have risen up against
the occupation are not "insurgents" or "terrorists" or "The Enemy".
They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow,
and they will win. Sounds pretty sickening, especially considering that
Moore pretends to be "on the side" of the troops and their families
when he is actually advocating the ENEMY! Not to mention his eerie
presentation of 9/11, recalling it to be a horrible, unforgettable
event. Yeah, for any person of rationale and sanity! Moore on September
12, 2001: "I don't know why we're making such an issue of terrorism in
this country. You're more likely to get struck by lightning than get
killed by a terrorist." Despicable, isn't it. But wait, there's
"Moore": (Referring to the heroic passengers who brought the plane down
in Shanksville, PA): "The passengers were scaredy-cats because they
were mostly white..." How can anybody with a shred of humanity and
intelligence advocate or believe anything this MONSTER of a human being
says or does? I am merely trying to expose the truth about a man whom
many people have deemed a "great American patriot", and let you, as
fellow citizens and thinking people, be the judge. President Bush was
thankfully re-elected on November 2, and thus "Fahrenheit 9/11" deemed
a miserable failure! Let's continue to show that our people are alive
and functioning in sanity and not in sheer lunacy! I hope you're happy,
Michael Moore... Zero Stars out of Four

I was very disappointed in F9/11, it was of little interest to anyone
other than Americans, it suffered from too few appearances from Mr
Moore, his personal screen presence lifted the movie each time he took
an active part. Also it seemed full of cheap shots at George Bush using
editing, using this method anyone can be made to look stupid. I was
hoping for a balanced viewpoint, it was far too one sided. I must agree
with other posters that the anguish of the bereaved mother was
overplayed. I very much enjoyed Bowling for Columbine, it seemed to
have a definite point unlike this movie, the only purpose of which
seems to be to get Kerry into the White House.

Michael Moore is not a bad propagandist. He does many things skilfully.
Note for example how he never actually says that members of the Bin
Laden family have not been interrogated about about Osama and his
whereabouts. He just repeats that it would have been reasonable to
interrogate them, thereby creating the impression that they have not
been interrogated, and that they probably know where Osama is! Have they been interrogated? Well, this movie sure doesn't answer that
question. Neither does it provide any other answers. It does provide
impressions and insinuations. Impressions and insinuations that almost
without one single exception are false, and often blatantly so.You need a LOT of knowledge to see through Moore's propagandist lies.
Now, if he just could bother to make his movies look good, then maybe
he will be remembered in the future as the Leni Riefenstahl of the 21st
century. If not, he will just be remembered as a big liar, or maybe not
at all.If you are thinking of seeing this movie, see Fahrenhype 9/11 first.

Interesting choice of words from David Oldfield (an Australian Member of
Parliament) after seeing this movie and giving it a rating of 10/10 as a
propaganda film: "The ilk of which I haven't seen since Goebbels (Nazi Propaganda Minister).
Michael Moore simply preys on the prejudices of the bleeding hearts and I
saw it as a film of considerable misinformation. This is not a documentary because there is no balance to it. He writes
specifically from the perspective of doing nothing but attacking George W.
Bush, the Bush family and the Bush administration. You can write a dirty story about Gandhi if you set out to do it. It's very
easy to make someone look bad when they have no opportunity for rebuttal.There's no skill in making war look terrible. Hiroshima was a terrible event
but it ended war in the Pacific and saved millions of lives."

This film has many admirers, has won awards and made a lot of money. It
was also one of the talking points of 2004. Unusual for a documentary.
It is also utter rubbish, unless you're a leftist Bush hater, in which
case Michael Moore is your god. This is absolutely not a documentary. A
documentary must at least try to present a fair and balanced view of
the facts. This never makes any attempt at that. Instead it's a
continuous tirade against Bush and all he stands for. Now Bush is an
idiot. Everyone except half the American electorate knows that. But if
this had been anything other than a movie then Bush and Co. would have
had, and deserved, a right of reply. As it stands it's a flawed work,
preaching only to the converted. It fails in Moore's aim of convincing
anyone but those with the feeblest of minds who always believe the last
thing they are told. There is certainly a case to be made against Bush
and his policies, the fact that Moore hasn't made it does us all a
disservice.

I think the most important aspect of any documentary is the ability to
entertain its audience. This does not mean it must be "fun." It can be
moving, disturbing, or horrifying. But I think that, at the least, it
should be able to maintain a viewer's interest  if a filmmaker has
succeeded at this, he has succeeded -- period. There could be thousands
of lies in Fahrenheit 9/11, but if the overall product of these fibs
entertained me I might be willing to at least recommend it based solely
on thus.Alas, F-9/11 didn't really grab my interest at all. This has nothing to
do with my political or social beliefs. I didn't agree with Bowling for
Columbine but I still heavily recommended it and found it fascinating
and well made.Fahrenheit is not well made. Moore resorts to one thing he has, up
until this point in time, all so narrowly avoided: downright
propaganda. Whereas his earlier films had moments of sarcastic wit and
dry humor, a relief from the heavy-handed nature of the program, 9/11
has virtually none. No amusing interviews by Moore in which he tracks
down reluctant interviewees, no unique animation sequences. In fact,
there's barely any Moore here at all! Sure, he narrates the thing, but
we see him so rarely, one begins to forget he's doing more than
directing.Moore also falls victim to repetitiveness here. Many of the issues he
touches, he later regurgitates in different forms. A majority of his
"attacks" on Bush are sort of shameless back-handed slaps  careless
and sloppy. Moore also has a few contradictions in his material that
stick out like a sore thumb  such as the mother who complains that she
was targeted by airline security, when in fact the reason this happened
in the first place (which Moore seemingly forgets to mention) is due to
a civil and racial liberties act.He has a few good points, but many of them hold no weight because when
viewed from a different perspective, it's clear it's all quite
insubstantial or painfully obvious. And his constant degrading
references to Bush, and use of the first-person Bush verbal perspective
with quotes such as "What would daddy do?", become grating and seem
very juvenile. I thought Moore was above such childish name-calling
antics. It's clear he hates Bush  and that's mainly the problem with
this documentary. He hates Bush so much, and with such vengeance, that
his "message" is lost in the material. It starts out as a fairly
balanced argument, but we get the idea that the more he rants and
fumes, the angrier he becomes, eventually reaching a point where he
totally abandons the decent approach of documentaries, and turns his
film into a series of repetitive cheap-shots and unsubstantiated,
biased rants.I liked Bowling for Columbine even if I didn't agree with it. I
expected to at least find Fahrenheit 9/11 amusing. However, it's so
venomous and filled with utter hatred, that I have a feeling only
die-hard anti-Bush folk will feel satisfied  the "middle region" of
America with an open mind will feel like we've had a bunch of angry
spew forced down our throats by a man taking advantage of his camera
and editing abilities.Hopefully, Moore's next documentary will return to the well-balanced
and amusing elements of Columbine, which was filled with wit, sarcasm,
humor, yet retained its core theme. Fahrenheit is muddled and boring,
and judged solely as a documentary I believe it is poorly made and in
bad taste.For my money, Super Size Me is a superior documentary and contains the
sharp wit and dry humor that Fahrenheit is sorely lacking.

No Academy Award nominations for this pile of lies and creative

is less, and he may find himself sitting alone at the donut shop.Hats off to the Academy for shutting out this tripe. They have also
prevented that worm from getting in front of a microphone at the show
and spreading his lies and hate.Anyone who has seen F9/11 MUST see Farhenhype 911, which explains each
and every lie in the film. Of course liberals will not bother with the
facts, but to the others who want the truth, see BOTH films.Let's see if they actually post this....

Saw the first showing at noon today (an extended lunch hour on a rainy
day). Reality check -- this movie isn't a documentary. Even Moore
himself has described Fahrenheit 9/11 as an "op/ed" piece -- it is not
unbiased journalism. If you insist this a documentary, then I will
agree with you provided you agree that Ron Popeil is the single
greatest documentation in US history. Let's just call Fahrenheit 9/11
an infomercial for Moore's political viewpoints. I had seen Roger and Me years ago, a clever "gotcha" piece. It was an
expanded version of what 60 Minutes was in the early days, when Mike
Wallace would show up after they got somebody to do or say something
bad on hidden camera and then try to get that
on-my-God-deer-in-headlights look that the bad guys always had when
they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar. Clever, but also a
bit dated these days as a tactic. Fahrenheit 9/11 is more sophisticated, but at the same time pretty
transparent in its overwhelming desire to make Bush look like a moron.
There were no surprises, probably because a tremendous amount of what's
in the movie has been "out there" on the Internet for months. If we
didn't have Iraq and Afghanistan 24/7 on many cable channels for months
and another couple of months of hype about this movie, maybe it would
have had more impact on me, but I wound up being quite bored. As for his editing style, I'd bet (as he was accused of doing in
"Bowling for Columbine") Moore did a bit of rearranging of footage to
make certain people look foolish -- some things seemed disconnected,
though you were led to believe they were all part of one continuous
flow. As one journalist said, the difference between a credible
journalist and Michael Moore is Moore just rearranges things to suit
his purposes -- a credible journalist will insert an ellipsis (. . .)
between words to indicate they've edited for brevity, not content. With
Moore, you don't get the ellipsis.So, Moore gets two thumbs up for being clever, again. But just being
clever isn't enough anymore. I suspect this movie will do well
financially. It can't have cost much to make. Those who hate Bush will
line up to pay their admission to see Bush look like a bumbling hick
and they won't be disappointed. Those who subscribe to various and
sundry right wing conspiracy theories will also be thorough
entertained.Here comes the tough critique: Others have written books or produced news stories that have unseated
politicians, even Presidents. Moore's use of his films hasn't caused a
single change material in the World. I think it's because he's too hung
up on making people look foolish and less interested in using his
considerable skills to investigate and report on real stories. But that
sort of work won't make you quite as wealthy as Moore has become. He's
created his own genre and is becoming ever more wealthy with each
project. In that regard, you have to admire him as a financial success.
But if his true motive is to change the world he's an abject failure.

Let me start off by saying that I'm biased. I am a Republican, and
(surprise!) am not a huge fan of Michael Moore. But I decided to judge
the movie more based on its quality than on my personal opinion of it
(more on that later). Here's what I thought: First of all, anyone who
says that this movie is NOT propaganda is flat wrong. I heard Michael
Moore interviewed on NPR's "Fresh Air", and he stated that the purpose
of the movie was "to get Bush out of office". The explicit objective of
the film is to impose an opinion on the audience; thus it is
propaganda. Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that.But some things were clearly wrong with this movie; mainly Michael
Moore's typical habit of complaining about the way things are without
suggesting how things SHOULD be. Moore tells us what he considers to be
a problem, but offers no real solution apart from implying that change
is needed. I know this would have been beside the point of the film,
but the least Moore could have done was promote an alternative to the
current state of affairs. The film fails in this regard--it's basically
smearing George W. Bush, albeit often with (selective) facts, and
nothing else. This is the biggest fundamental flaw of the movie.I could detail all of my other grievances concerning this film--that
Moore excludes any fact that would weaken his conviction (exactly what
he now criticizes the Bush White House for doing, strangely); that he
chiefly includes interviews with not-so bright conservatives rather
than ones with intelligent conservatives; or that the movie is,
frankly, highly unlikely to change many people's opinions about
Bush--most of the people who see this movie probably already hate Bush
anyway. But I really don't see the need to. I give this a 5 out of 10
because, although I think Farenheit is ultimately flawed and
unpersuasive, the movie did successfully present a case against
President Bush. It's worth seeing, if for no other reason, to
understand a very distinctive view on American politics. But it's not
particularly good.

The political commentary in this film was as timely as political
commentary can ever be. The footage from Iraq needs to be seen, though
it must be kept in mind that this is not a pacifist film. Propaganda is
not art! This film is no masterpiece! Even though I agree with the
political agenda it puts forth, I'm disgusted to see the international
community give a film the Palme D'Or just because its political views
flatter their own. If you want to see a well done Moore film, go watch
Roger and Me. But remember, even satirical propaganda is not
necessarily art! Declare the emperor naked, people, for Christ's sake!
Valid political commentary? Maybe. But artistic achievement? I think
not.

First off, don't most movies on IMDb have a hyperlink to a page with
all the goofs? In this case, it must have been omitted because the
internet lacks sufficient capacity to record all the intentionally
misleading and outright false portrayals.Perhaps if Moore were not such a blatant hypocrite, he might have an
ounce of credibility. As you might recall, he made his name with ROGER
AND ME which ravaged GM for laying off workers that were not needed
because sales were down. Guess what Moore did? Right - he laid off his
publicist and secretary because he didn't have enough work for them to
do. He can afford to keep paying them (a charge he made against GM),
but he laid them off anyway. As Leona Helmsley would say, "RULES are
for little people", and no one can accuse this clown of being little!But back to the movie, bring on your lawyers grand liar! It is pure
crap. I used to think that accountants and statiticians were the
masters of deception - but Moore proved that it's the film editors that
hold the grand prize.With three relatives in the military, including one in Iraq now and one
already back from Afghanistan, it's clear that the only thing Moore
cares for the folks in uniform is exploiting them for political
purposes. The troops see right through him.Well, the large moron gets what he cultivated. We have recently moved
to Ohio but had not re-registered to vote. After seeing 911, we were
motivated - but no longer as independents - put us down firmly in
Bush's camp. And in just the 5 days since seeing this "documentary" (so
called anyway)we have convinced 11 others to register as well. Good
thing we live in a battleground state. We also gave as much as we
legally could to the Bush and Nader campaigns!Anyone who spreads as much hate as Moore must be soundly defeated by
the ballots in November. If he thought he had a message, it was
overwhelmed by the vitrol of the medium. When Bush is re-elected, I
hope Moore realizes the credit he gets for creating the backlash making
it possible.

Talk about pandering to one side of the political spectrum and
producing what anyone with a Kerry or Gore sticker still on their car
would want to see. Sad. Very sad. I finally broke down and watched this
and was terribly troubled to believe that people think this movie is a
documentary.I may have had a chance to appreciate it if it weren't so blatantly
one-sided. For those of us who lean toward the middle, we hate to see
either side froth at the mouth in this way. This tripe is just as bad
as the worst venomous "documentary" that the KKK or the Third Reich
could have produced...just on the other side of the spectrum.If you're a liberal and just "Hate Bush" because he's "Stupid", then
this movie is for you. If you are a "Bush Lover" then you should avoid
this movie because it will just make your blood pressure rise. If you
actually put some thought into your political views and side with
neither party all the time, then be prepared to be saddened. This is
what the major parties can create.

Abraham Lincoln said it best: "You can fool all of the people some of
the time; Some of the people all of the time; but you can't fool all of
the people all of the time."Anyone who believes that Moore's film (you can't call it a documentary)
is delivering the "truth" has been "fooled"! There is a scene in
Charlie Chaplin's 1936 classic, MODERN TIMES, that says it better then
any words. The films starts with a mass of workers moving along and
makes a quick dissolve to a bunch of sheep. The millions who have
thrilled at the Moore garbage are a bunch of sheep being lead by a
vicious wolf -- and a very unAmerican wolf at that!Recently I viewed the Documentary (one that is a documentary) that
dares to stand up to the big, bad wolf (Moore). It is called FAHRENHYPE
9/11. It was made by a group that didn't set out to make a film to
counter Moore's movie, but as they investigated they discovered that
Moore likes to re-order time and to twist facts in a way the changes
the truth (to put it nicely).One example of what Moore did was take a minor "Letter to Editor" entry
from a newspaper and change it into a newspaper headline. It is on the
screen for about one second, but it is a complete lie (and Moore knows
it).A number of people who are shown in Moore's film also appear in
FAHRENHYPE 9/11 and speak for themselves -- not as Moore uses them in
his film. And they are not very happy with how they were misused. One
soldier sends a message to Moore that he doesn't need Moore to speak
for him -- he can speak for himself -- and it is NOT the lies that
Moore painted.Do yourself a favor and get hold of FAHRENHYPE 9/11 -- instead of being
lied to by a man who hates America, be inspired by a film that is
honest and uplifting as it counter-acts the Moore deceptions! In fact,
it destroys FAHRENEIT 9/11 point by point!

Michael Moore is so politically blinded that he dares to call this
FLICK a documentary. What a crock! It is hard for me to understand how
so many people can be taken in by the lies presented in this fictitious
flick. I suppose it is all those that also believe in the mysterious
right-wing conspiracy who get taken in by this stuff. My guess is that
people who liked this movie were the same people who are trying to NOW
unload that underground Y2K shelter. It is too bad that we have so many
in this country today who know not how to weigh facts and possess no
discerning skills. If you fell for this grossly distortion of events,
then you might just be part of that "a sucker is born everyday" crowd.

This was the absolute worst movie i've ever seen. I've never walked out
of a movie so p***ed off as I did after this. I can't believe that
people would even produce this movie. How can you sit there and make a
movie about how much you hate Bush. Who cares. He forgot to mention
anything at all that Bush has done good for this country. I am only 18
years old and i'm sure my opinion doesn't matter, but I have been
raised as a strong Republican, but even if there was a movie made
putting down Clinton, or any other Democratic president, I would still
be p***ed off. It's sad b/c it might take a movie like this to sway the
votes in November. After this movie was over people actually clapped. How could anyone
clap for something so horrible. They didn't even say any facts about
9/11, it was all about how Bush was on vacation for a long time and he
doesn't do anything good for our country. They make it sound like all
he does is messes up. But people don't understand that when you are put
into power the decisions you make are not going to please everyone.
There is no virtual way to please EVERY person in America. But give the
guy some credit. He's came into office during a time when America was
under attack and he went and retailiated and destroyed Iraq. People
complain b/c we killed innocent people, but who the hell died in 9/11?
Innocent people. So before this Mike chump goes and attempts to make a
movie making try to hate Bush and feel sorry for his home town of
Flint, Michigan, he needs to get his facts straight and have an open
mind instead of being so biased. It was a horrible movie and a definite
waste of $8.00

the main problem with this film is that it's just PLAIN BORING! At
least Bowling for columbine was entertaining because you always wanted
to see how Moore would shame and degrade himself next, but in this film
all he does is splice together a series of never ending archive footage
of George W Bush, the war on terror, politicians, etc and narrate the
unrelated sequences in the most monotone voice imaginable. If Moore
won't even put any effort into his work how can he expect other people
to get excited over it? This is just lazy and Moore should no better.
While he was never one to let the truth get in the way of a good story,
he does not even bring a good story here! this is just plain lazy with
a capital L!

This thing stinks, I couldn't even get through the first 30 or so
minutes. Horrible acting, dialog, presentation and story, because
that's all it was. The cast was at best wooden and obviously nothing
more than script-fed "Biological Puppets". Thank God I only wasted a
buck on the "Dollar Rental". But if one were to go by the ratings it
receives here and the supposedly balanced and objective media, it's the
most important movie of the decade, nae, the century. BAH! The only
thing missing was that the Bush administration used alien, sorry,
"Undocumented Off Planet Persons" technology from Area 51 (ROFL) to
control the four jetliners so it only looked like they were under enemy
control. Come on, if Moore put that in they'd say it was so, too. You
know they would. The fact is, the wars in Afgahnistan and Iraq were/are
a complete success, in that those people have a chance to vote for the
government they want, tyranny or democracy. Of course, the Liberal
Elete say, "We don't have a right to force liberty on them". But try to
force tyranny on a Liberal and what do you get? Easy, a Conservative. As for what it was designed for; Strictly to see to it that Bush was
not re-elected, it failed, just like in the box office and at the
rental counter. Now, when there is a movie with a distinctly Right Wing
bias, Conservatives can look at it objectively and point out flaws,
both major and minor, IE, The Green Barettes. The sun setting in the
west and a pine forest instead of jungle, er, sorry, "Rain Forest",
comes to mind. But, if a piece of tripe like this oozes out of
Hollywood, Liberals clamber, stumble and climax all over themselves
finding absolutely nothing wrong with it. If I were a Liberal I'd be
embarrassed by this crud and change ideologies in a New York Minute.Do yourself a favor and pass this up for one the, "Evil US
Government/Corporation plots against 'The People' with a
mutated/genetically engineered giant
snake/spider/octopus/shark/alligator that the liberal Native
American/woman (of any race)/African American/Mexican American/Gay or

This propaganda film is one of the worst yet.It is completely
ridiculous to think that more than 2% of this movie has any truth to
it. I'm not even politically stable, but I realize that this movie
could be used as fertilizer, if you get what I'm saying. It is a
disgrace to films and film makers everywhere. The only reason it did as
well as it did/does is because of impressionable kids, like myself,
falling for everything people tell them. And, just to be fair, the
movie isn't even well made. Come on...people. Can't you see that
Michael Moore mashed potatoes, please made this film of his own opinion
completely, and edited film clips to make the president look worse and
worse. I'm not saying you have to agree with what he does,(God knows I
often times don't) but he is leading our country in this time of war,
and we should stand by him. I would not call a propaganda film, such as
this one, "standing by him."

If you cut and paste peoples words you can make them say anything you
wish them to say. This movie is propaganda that the Nazi's would have
been proud of. Moore, however, is only slightly more manipulative of
his "facts" and spins just a little harder to the left than Dan Rather
or Brokaw, so, we ought to be used to it by now. Where are we going
that we can take a national tragedy which occurred due to the ineptness
of the previous administration and reconstruct the event as a lie in
order to promote a political agenda? The next thing you know he'll be
doing a "documentary" on how Clinton molested women because he felt
sorry for them and wanted them to feel "needed."

This movie isn't a Documentary first off. It is an opinion piece that
disregards the facts and distorts the truth to such an extent that it is
mindblowing. The people who love this movie must ignore reality to such a
degree where they will believe anything as long as it is bad against
Bush.In a time of war and when our troops are fighting for their lives and for
freedom to keep us safe, the fact that this movie makes their sacrifices
seem trivial and portrays us (yes I am a soldier and have been to the Gulf
three times so don't tell me I don't know what I am talking about) as
enjoying shooting up Iraqis and us torturing them for enjoyment is a
disgrace. And the people who support this piece of trash Moore are a
disgrace as well. Friends of mine have died so you can sit in your house and
scream about the injustice of this war and how evil Bush is and conspiracies
galore while we see on a daily basis the REAL Iraq. You just see what Moore
made Iraq look like in his editing room. To the troops over there right now, know most of us support you and know
what we are doing is the right thing. The ones trying to hold us to a
different standard than the terrorists are the cowards here who would rather
pacify are enemies than kill them, they would rather punish us for fighting
for freedom and democracy than punish the fanatics for beheading our
countrymen, they would rather women and minorities be harshly treated around
the globe while we stand by and do nothing. Thank god their not in power now
and I hope this disgrace of a movie and a disgrace of a man Moore changes
nothing in November.

As usual Mike comes up with a twisted truth that is more lies than
truth. His truth is more like a Hollywood movie that is 'based on true
incident'. If the people who like his movies would actually open their
eyes and do just a little bit of investigation, they'd see just how
much bias (lies) he actually put in his "documentaries" instead of
excepting blindly his truth. I'd like to meet these people face to face
as I have some swamp land and city bridges I'd like to sell them. I
guess it's like Hitler said, make the lie big enough and enough people
will believe it. This insults a reasonable persons intelligence so much

says no American's were ever threatened by Saddam ... HELLO!!! He
threatened to kill George Bush Sr.Micheal Moore is so far to the left that it is impossible for him to
make a true, fair and balanced film concerning this country or any of
our leaders!Hitler was more honest with people about the holocaust than Moore is
about Bush in this film!Bush did his job to the best of his ability! It is always easy to look

Michael Moore an acclaimed novelist and filmmaker is famous for
bad-mouthing and as he claims "exposing" the truth about America, in
regards to oil profits foreign policy and most recently the war with
and occupation of Iraq.Mr Moore however is the master of the cheap shot, his ability to
embellish and elaborate certain facts to the point where they are
global conspiracy's, has made him what he is today. The man however
should stick to exploiting the institutional problems that clearly do
exist within America itself. Bowling for columbine Moore's first
critically and globally acclaimed film challenged and explored the
overwhelming problem of gun culture and the still existing problem of
racial prejudices being fuelled by the media, leading to one of the
most horrific juvenile crimes in American history the columbine high
school massacre. This film was eye opening powerful and for the most
part accurate. Moore's chief priority now though seems to be
challenging the credibility and exploiting the truth about George w
Bush his father and how they stole the general election using George H
Bush's cronies, tame judges and electoral fraud. Although most of
Moore's information on this matter is accurate Fahrenheit 9/11 is
simply not.The film itself is really an example of Moore's regurgitation and
repackaging of things said in earlier novels such as stupid white men
and downsizes this. The first half of this film is mainly about
America's dealings with Saudi Arabia and how it connects with the
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Footage of Donald Rumsfeld shaking
hands with Sadam Hussein and the Saudi's in the early nineties is quite
powerful; using slow dramatic music this film could easily obfuscate
one from the truth. But Moore doesn't focus on America's primary
concern being to stay rich and get richer through oil profits in a
truthful manner. He creates the illusion that every move America makes
is decided by a secret cabal of white house officials who are in league
with the terrorists the average American fears. He pushes his belief
that every move is made in the interest of the Saudis. Interesting as
this may be it does not at all correspond with America's most recent
wars. Saudi Arabia was not too happy about the invasion of Afghanistan
and so critical of the invasion of Iraq that they ordered Americans,
off their territory. If the general thrust of this movie is as Moore
quotes; "The truth and nothing but the truth." Then why do Americans
keep doing the opposite of what their masters dictate?The next conspiracy theory in this film is about America only invading
Afghanistan so Unocal could build a natural Gas pipeline that will be
worth millions. Moore completely ignores the Talibans reign of terror
or how terrorists took up residence there, but instead focuses solely
on Unocal. The fundamental problem with this conspiracy is that Unocal
abandoned their plans and is not going to resume them any time soon.The second half of this feature (much more credible than the first) is
about the very controversial war in Iraq. Moore uses the most horrific
footage one could find depicting the carnage perpetrated by the
military. He then visits a mother in his hometown of flint Michigan who
lost her son in Iraq when insurgents shot down a black hawk helicopter.
Her grief is heartbreaking and far more powerful than any statistic
that could be printed, but it is in my opinion milked for too long.Moore's film is filled with blatant contradictions, if there were far
too few terrorist alerts prior to 9/11 then why is it a bad thing that
there are more now. Furthermore if airport security was far too lax
before why mock extensive measures being taken to ensure safe flights
now. This film does not qualify as a documentary; anyone who believes
it does should read a dictionary, which will clearly state that a
documentary should; present facts objectively without editorialising or
inserting fictional matter. This film crosses the line from selective
reporting of evidence in support of a position, to fabricating evidence
in support of a position. To be fair many documentaries are guilty of
this but Moore is not even subtle in his approach, he doesn't seem to
even attempt to hide his blatant disregard for facts.The main and most offending contradiction though, is Moors claim that
there are not enough televised funerals of fallen soldiers in Iraq. But
Moore has quoted that the Iraqi resistance are not the terrorists or
insurgents but, that they are freedom fighters, and that their numbers
will grow and they will win. I would pay to see Mr Moore visit the
funeral of a fallen soldier and explain to the relatives that their son
or daughter was killed by the Iraqi revolution. I would then join in
the chorus about his supposed courage.People may call Michael Moore the thorn in the side of corporate
America or the scourge of political hypocrisy but that does not make
him right.

After viewing the film and remembering Moore's childish outbursts
against President Bush at the Oscar ceremonies, it is obvious that he
made the film just before the election, hoping to defeat Bush at the
polls. Because it was apparent to many viewers that Moore is an
ideologue with an ax to grind, his film probably galvanized
conservative voters and Bush was re-elected. Moore's pseudo documentary is too much like Oliver Stone's outlandish
JFK film which asks viewers to believe a conspiracy that is even more
outlandish and unsubstantiated than the Warren Report which it seeks to
contradict. Moore criticizes Bush for sitting in an elementary classroom and not
reacting more quickly to the terrorist attacks. He suggests that Bush
was befuddled. One could just as easily conclude that Bush was shocked
and then reflective, not wanting a knee jerk reaction. An official
inquiry into 911 concluded that Bush, like nearly every intelligence
agency in the world as well as the U.N. believed that Hussein had nukes
and was hiding them. Why else would he resort to subterfuge and kick
out U.N. inspectors. Bush went to war only after Hussein violated over
a dozen UN resolutions, yet Moore would have us believe that Bush
merely lied us into war.What might have been a meaningful film that would encourage policy
debate is seriously marred by Moore's personal politics, half-truths,
and tendency to be disingenuous. Moose seems to be more interested in
character assassination than enlightening his audience.

First, let's get this out of the way: I'm a liberal. I'm a hippy, a
vegetarian, a tree-hugger, a dog-lover and I play the guitar very
badly. So you can believe I'm not politically motivated when I say THIS
MOVIE WAS AWFUL.From its opening remarks, Fahrenheit 9/11 takes a very snide,
condescending tone as if Moore were hiding his ignorance behind
sarcasm. You know the type--the jerk at the office water cooler who
can't formulate a coherent argument, so he or she resorts to cynicism,
sarcastic baby talk and adolescent rhetoric. P.S. If you don't know the
type I'm talking about, then more than likely IT'S YOU! :PThe issues presented in this film are indeed issues worthy of
intelligent debate, but not in the childish way Moore presents them.
It's totally discrediting.Conservatives of the world, I apologize. If you would please dismiss
this silly Moore character (I believe "attention whore" is the term the
kids use today), perhaps you would see that there are intelligent,
learned, well-spoken individuals who embrace the liberal philosophy.
No, we're not all PETA extremists, loud-mouthed protesters and
hypocritical filmmakers.Liberals of the world, please don't allow this ad hominem propaganda to
drive you to absurdity. I don't believe Moore is truly one of us. He's

anything! Best of luck. Peace whenever possible.

***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** Let me begin by saying that I went into Michael
Moore's latest, "Fahrenheit 9/11" with the absolute lowest
expectations, as I am not too particularly fond of Michael Moore or his
"ingenious, incendiary, documentaries". I had expected all of the Bush
bashing, blame America first, and sordid, brainwashing fallacy that was
to consist of this atrocious film. "Fahrenheit 9/11", I am thoroughly
convinced, was beyond even my worst expectations, as I hadn't
anticipated even Moore to stoop so degradingly, intolerably low. Take
it from someone who regularly (O.K. constantly) watches the news and is
perhaps the most politically conscious youth in America today,
"Fahrenheit 9/11" is nothing more than a Bush, American, capitalistic,
and even militaristic hate machine, determined to undermine, most
especially, our commander-in-chief, our men and women serving
courageously for our freedom and security, and our very state of mind.
Come on, folks. Does anybody with a right mind actually believe half of
the garbage Michael Moore has emanated in this film?Does anybody actually believe that Afghanistan, whose people were
brutally oppressed and whose government harbored al Quaida, is
essentially the same today as it was BEFORE our retaliation in 2001?
Aside from that, this is a film with no other purpose than an insidious
assault and derision upon President Bush (wanting us to believe he is
incompetent, ridiculous, and apathetic in leadership and abroad), thus
endeavoring to unseek our president through deception, ridicule, and
fallacy. Moore purports that Bush is a feeble, culpable leader who was
uncertain and unprepared during the terrible attacks on 9/11, and who
thereafter has been futile and disastrous in conducting a War on
Terrorism. Perhaps the most atrocious part of the film focuses on a
"futile, disastrous" Afghanistan campaign, resulting in very little but
perhaps a worsened civility throughout Afghanistan. Then, he ventures
into the Iraq campaign, implying that "evil American imperialism" has
devastated every Iraqi families and that life was good and jolly under
the rule of Saddam Hussein and his murderous regime. Good one, Mike.
Torture chambers, mass graves, mobile weapons facilities. "Fictitious
reasons" indeed. Now how would you believe such a statement would
resonate with the men and women overseas who strove and succeeded in
toppling the Taliban government, Saddam Hussein's Bath government, and
captured a vast majority of al Quaida operatives and its associates in
the process? Michael Moore's reasoning behind the War on Terror, under
absolute, unevidenced assumption: OIL. If Michael Moore is deemed a
"patriot" in the production of this film, then I am the dictator of the
Republic of Mars. Furthermore, this liberal propaganda is about as one-sided as it gets.
Take Michael Moore's interviewees: several congressmen: all Democrats
(no Republicans), distressed, grieving mothers (Linda Lipscumb) and
their equally upset son (War is terrible; there are indeed
casualties...(while neglecting to focus on proud, confident soldiers,
who are optimistic about their endeavors overseas), and devastated
Iraqi citizens proceeding the War in Iraq (while neglecting to
concentrate on devastated, oppressed citizens during the reign of
Saddam Hussein). Moore neglects to even acknowledge "the other side",
as such would merely compromise his thesis: President Bush has been a
failure, from the grounds of the 2000 election to the War in Iraq,
America and several other nations have been tarnished under his watch,
and little has been accomplished since 9/11. I have always believed
that a good debate could perceive and acknowledge BOTH points of view,
instead of just one; I suppose Michael Moore thinks otherwise. My
conclusion of "Fahrenheit 9/11": sometimes daunting (in its own
fallacy), sometimes pathetic (often resorting to ridiculing Bush and
his administration (sometimes when they are not even looking)) and
always atrocious (endeavoring to brainwash whatever ignorant/undecided
American into concurring with Michael Moore on subjects which should be
examined objectively). Shame on you, Michael Moore; I can only hope
that people are not as ignorant and stupid as you would like to believe
Americans are. Let me exit with some Michael Moore patriotism:
"Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet. We don't know
anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is
embarrassing..." I'll make up my own mind this November, Mr. Moore.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a Bush haters dream. Michael Moore makes a case for
congress passing the patriot act (un-read) and taking away freedoms
from Americans. Moore focuses the beginning of the movie with both
daddy Bush and junior Bush having ties to the Saudi Arabian government.
(This includes the Bid-Laden family and their business investments). I
am surprised he did not make a case for the Easter bunny and tooth
fairy since I would find it more believable than has argument. The
later part of the film focuses more towards the soldiers fighting in
Iraq.Michael Moore uses just enough truth to make believers of the ignorant
and the extreme wing of the Democratic Party. Moderates and
independents will find this movie hard to stomach, even if you disagree
with Bush and his policies. Being a student of history and knowing
about how skillful propagandist can influence people through their
ignorance. I am sad that more of the mainstream news media outlets have
not researched Michael Moore's failures in the facts department and
reported it. What happened to the people right to know? If this kind of distortion is what it takes to beat Bush, then John
Kerry and the Democratic Party are in serious trouble. This kind of
crap can only hurt John Kerry in his run for the presidency with
independent voters and liberal Republicans. Maybe Michael Moore is
really a hard-core undercover Republican trying to damage the
Democratic Party. If not, he should be given the damage he has done to
the credibility of those trying to unseat Bush.The bottom line is Michael Moore does not allow facts to get in the way
of his message. He is skillful in the manner he puts the film together.
This is the only positive I found in this film. If the end justifies
the means at any cost, then this is a great film. One would have to go
back to Nazi Germany to find this level of propaganda and skill. Joseph
Goebbels would be very proud. I give it a 7 on quality and a 1 on
content. Don't waste your money.

the entire Bush family. We'll ignore the fact that the *only* major
weapons platform the Defense Dept. has canceled since President Bush
took office was the Crusader artillery platform - an United Defense
product. But that's an inconvenient detail.Mr. Moore was filming in front of the Saudi Embassy, and a uniformed
Secret Service agent came up to him and asked him a few questions about
his activities. The director than makes a huge deal about why the
Secret Service is hassling him just for standing in D.C.? We'll ignore
the fact that the US Secret Service is the only uniformed federal law
enforcement agency in DC for that type of situation (can't exactly send
a Park Ranger) and we're OBLIGATED BY TREATY (The Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations) to protect foreign missions inside our country. I'd
think we all agree the Saudi embassy is a lot more of a potential
target than, say, the Jamaican. If somebody was filming the American
Embassy inside Saudi Arabia, I want that person asked what they're
doing. It's not a violation of civil rights to be asked what you're
doing.The thing I found the biggest waste of time was little snide comments
throughout the piece such as "the night the President arrived in
Florida, he slept on fine french linens." As if the thread count
somebody sleeps on prove something.So ignore this unbelievable contrite diatribe disguised as 'courageous
dissent' against an evil system. Oh, and what really depressed me, was
the total lack of respect to the Office of the President of the United
States. I don't care who you voted for or what was done by who when,
the entire system depends on respect for the office. Don't waste our
time with "Rush Limbaugh didn't show them respect", I'm trying to be a
citizen at a higher level than Rush and Mike. This is movie is a waste
of time that's disingenuous at best, borderline criminal at worst. He
had a chance to use a soapbox like few of us will ever have, and it's
wrong to masquerade as journalism what he made.

As far as a movie done in the genre of propaganda, it was very well
done. I took notes on the allegations, and there were a river of them,
and then compared them with the counter DVD, Fahrenhype 911. I had
taken it all in and wanted to evaluate it based on what I could know,
as facts vs. fiction (as it had an divisive affect between me and my
friend). It turned out from my view now that it clearly is propaganda.
Watch Fahrenhype 911 and see if you come to the same conclusion. Since Micheal Moore movie has allegations against the current US
president and his administration I see it as truly damaging to the
country's unity and encouraging to any who hate the US. The movie seems
to operate through errors, misrepresentations or lies, and undermine
the publics support for our national defense vs. terrorism (which Moore
believed is a made up threat). My nation needs true patriots who uphold
positive moral truths and this man, Michael Moore, seems to be far off
in this regard, as he paints the president and his administration as
the bad guys. Who is the bad guy during Sept. 11th? It's certainly not
George W. Bush, as he was given the burdens that this event caused as
the American president. Did he go to war in Iraq for his own personal
gain? I don't think so and don't think he could have fooled the whole
country in the way Michael suggests. Michael Moore ends up looking very
foolish when this movie is compared to the information in Farenhype
911. I recommend anyone who want to know the truth about these matters
go rent Farenhype 911 after seeing Fahrenheit 911, it you must see the
later movie at all.

I admire good film-making, and this movie is definitely well crafted. 
Unfortunately, it is so full of preposterous half-truths that no amount of
artistry can cover the sheer silliness of the film's premise.  An
interesting study in effective propaganda -- and that's about
it.If you hate George Bush, you'll love the Bush-hating.  If you like Bush,
you'll just be amazed that anyone can take this film seriously.In that regard, this film is similar to another recent controversial film,
Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ", in that people take away from the
film exactly what they take into it.  Both are well-made movies in their
respective rights, but both represent the sole view of the filmmaker.  In
both cases, these films do not tell the whole truth.

Of course Mike gets a few good jokes in, but completely ignores half of the
relevant facts.  Because this film is all about the content I wish he had be
more fair like he was in BFC.  At least there he somewhat fairly represented
the idea that other countries have guns and low fire-arm related deaths, why
is America different. In Fahrenheit, Mike ignores most of the facts that support going to war, the
success had in Iraq, how terrible Saddam really was.  Instead he takes
things said out of context, ignores the messages the Bush administration was
putting out there and most importantly he does not address the difficult
situation President Bush was in at the time, which a "documentary" should
do.Consider we had just had 9-11 and the American people wanted action.  Many
felt that the government/Bush administration was not "aggressive" enough. 
Compound this with intelligence from every source saying Saddam definitely
HAD WMDs at one time and no significant evidence existed that they were
gone.  Additionally consider that Saddam was extremely unlikely to get rid
of the WMDs himself.  What was Bush supposed to do?  Take the risk that
Saddam had WMDs and let it go, continue with sanctions.  Let inspectors
spend another year?  The fact is that we may not know for years if WMDs were destroyed in the
first Gulf War, if they were smuggled into a neighboring country, or if they
are still hidden underground in a mass grave of soldiers that hid them
there.  Yet Mike is confident that he is right.How many narcissists does it take to change a light bulb?
One, he holds the bulb while the world revolves around
him.

I will not ramble on excessivley, i'm sure enough people on this
website have done that. What I will say, though, is that I have never
left a movie theatre more depressed than after I saw this movie. The
fact that there are thousands of people proclaiming this tripe as
gospel is far more dammning an indictment of America than is Michael
Moore's poorly reasoned and sloppy "documentary." unless the sort of
propagandistic garbage contained in this film is roundly discredited
and revealed for what it is( an incoherent assault on America, not just
bush) than our country is in far worse straights than even Moore would
admit.as an interesting aside, i find it hilarious that Mr. Moore is severely
obese, VERY WEALTHY( he lives in a 1.9 million dollar apartment in new
york city) and is STUPID( he flunked out of college), when he entitled
a book stupid white men, and yells at Americans for being....wait for
it... FAT AND STUPID

This is not a documentary it is full of holes. Read Richard Clarke's AP interview regarding the film.Read these comments on the movie from 2 liberal reporters: On Wednesday
Newsweek's Michael Isikoff detailed an array of errors in the movie
that included, not just mistaken analysis, but seriously false claims -
like the charge that the Bush White House let members of the bin Laden
family flee the U.S. without any of them being interviewed by the FBI.Then there's the Washington Post's Richard Cohen, who calls Moore's
movie "juvenile in its approach" and "awful in its journalism," adding
that some of his claims are so easily dismissible that "Fahrenheit"
serves as "a warning to the Democrats to keep the loony left at a safe
distance."Enjoy this mockumentary -I thought it was a waste.

While must of what the film says is true there are a few lies Moore added to
the film and he even contradicts himself in the film with his own facts.The worst part of this "documentary" is that Moore presents the facts from a
very one sided viewpoint. Instead of showing the history behind 9/11 Moore
aims the film at one person, W Bush. What is left out of the film is that
Clinton/Gore handled Bin Laden even worse, why we have deals with the Saudis
in the first place, FDR from WWII, The Bin Laden families investments in
Disney Corp., his lying about Disney distributing the film and so many other
facts that I can't even list them all here. Moore does have a talent for
doing a hit piece on someone and there are people out there that will
believe everything Moore says in this film without question or without doing
their own investigations and that is a sad commentary on the education level
in America.This film is about as close to a documentary as "This is Spinal Tap"
is.

How can people like this collection of cheap shoots by Moore? One has to be
really ignorant about the history and facts to believe this spinning and
half truths pretendting to be a documentary. This movie reminds me the worse
times of the Joesph Gebbels propaganda against Jews in the Nazi Germany. I
could take all the available film footage of Mother Theresa and do a "Moore"
like movie showing that she was a terrible person that hurt everybody in
sight. Conversly, using just the authentic available footage, I can make a
"Moore" like film showing that Adolph Hitler was a great statesman that
helped the working poor and fought for peace and freedom. The comunists in
Soviet Union were as good as Moore in preparation of such propaganda. It is
a soory tribute to the ignorance of the American public that the Moore
propaganda can be so effective.

F911 is entertaining, and it is emotively persuasive, but key strands
of the argument are inconsistent with the evidence.Moore relies on a number of tricks to bring the viewer over to his
position. Moore may be justified in his obvious dislike of Bush, but in
the film he supports this using a number of mistruths or careful
misrepresentations.These are serious flaws in a documentary. Moore crosses the line from
selective reporting of evidence in support of a position, arguably
something all news reporting and documentaries are guilty of to some
degree, to making up evidence in support of a position. This begs the
question: if Moore's position requires such tactics, is it defensible? I recommend watching this film and then watching FahrenHYPE 9/11, a
pro-Bush counter to Fahrenheit which calls Moore on some of his careful
deception.

The problem with this film is that Moore's style is built on visceral
reactions rather than carefully crafted argument. The resulting
disorganized rant may be enjoyable for those who already share his
views, but it is unlikely to impress anyone else. Even those who agree
with him on many issues (I, for one, do) may find some of his
assertions hard to swallow. The most bizarre claims he has made,
though, are thankfully absent from the film. For instance, anyone who
reads his 2003 book "Dude, Where's My Country?" will discover that he
has actually questioned whether Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the
9/11 attacks:"Who attacked the United States on September 11--a guy on dialysis from
a cave in Afghanistan, or your friends, Saudi Arabia? .... How could a
guy sitting in a cave in Afghanistan, hooked up to dialysis, have
directed and overseen the actions of nineteen terrorists for two years
in the United States and then plotted so perfectly the hijacking of
four planes and then guaranteed that three of them would end up
precisely on their targets? .... How did he organize, communicate,
control and supervise this kind of massive attack? With two cans and a
string?" (pp. 15-6)For those who are wondering, this is not the only time that Moore has
tried to pass off a ridiculous statement with a "How could it be
otherwise?" tone. But any doubts he may still harbor on this matter are
not presented in the film. All he does is briefly mention that "Bin
Laden was a Saudi" to back up his claim that our real enemy is Saudi
Arabia, not Iraq.Moore does deserve credit for calling attention to the now-famous clip
showing the President remaining in a kindergarten classroom for seven
minutes after having been informed that the country was under attack.
It would have made sense for Bush to cut the session short, especially
since we now know that the Pentagon had not yet been struck and a
fourth hijacked plane was on the loose. The footage gives the
impression that Bush wasn't sure how to act on his own, without the
guidance of his advisers.Unfortunately, Moore's portrayal of other events is not quite so
defensible. In his depiction of the 2000 post-election controversy, for
example, he shows Jeffrey Toobin asserting that a statewide recount in
Florida would have shown Gore to be the winner "under every scenario."
But extensive studies by newspapers across the country showed that Bush
would have won under certain criteria, a fact that Toobin himself has
acknowledged. (See Toobin's book "Too Close to Call," pp. 278-9.) This
highlights why some have called the film one-sided. It's one thing to
express a viewpoint, it's quite another to ignore contrary evidence.The problem thus may be more in what the film doesn't show than in what
it shows. Take the famous scene where Moore confronts Congressmen and
encourages them to enlist their sons and daughters. We see some getting
flustered by the proposal, others refusing even to speak with Moore,
who then assures us that not a single Congressman took up his offer.
What we do not see is one who answers Moore eloquently, but it is
entirely possible that at least one of them did. That's the problem:
every single shot of the film is designed to make his targets look as
ridiculous as possible, and he doesn't include footage that fails to
serve that purpose. The film has just too much calculation to be
believed.This becomes particularly important when he shows a woman whose son
died in Iraq, and who stopped supporting Bush because of it. We watch
her become indignant, and then hysterical, after a passerby asserts
that her grief is staged. The trouble is that the sequence does feel
staged, not because the story was faked (I'll assume Moore wouldn't go
that far), but because Moore probably looked into many personal
accounts before he found exactly what he needed to make his point. I'm
sure that not everyone who has lost a loved one in this war has blamed
the President.We are also treated to graphic images of soldiers with debilitating
wounds, of civilian casualties in Iraq, of Iraqi women cursing America
for the destruction brought upon their families. But Moore could just
as well have chosen to show the victims of Saddam Hussein, who has
caused far more death and devastation than Bush has. The film omits
this fact, and an uninformed viewer might even get the impression that
Hussein was a benign dictator. Instead of building a real case against
the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Moore resorts to generic antiwar propaganda
that could be applied to any war the U.S. has ever fought. It's amazing
to me that in the entire film he mentions WMDs only once, as though
they're a side issue rather than the crux of the matter.If the film's purpose is to overthrow the Bush presidency, as Moore has
stated, then this implies a narrow focus. The film's endurance depended
to some extent on the outcome of the 2004 election. Had Kerry won,
people might have given this film credit for helping that to occur, and
it may have come to be seen as a historical marker. But a documentary
that does little more than lampoon contemporary political figures is
not likely to become a classic; its current popularity is mostly a
byproduct of the public's strong feelings about the election, which are
sure to dissipate.

A masterpiece in filmmaking. Michael Moore made such a moving and
wonderful film with Fahrenheit 9/11. Let's put politics aside.
Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a masterpiece for its politics, it is a
masterpiece for it's presentation. The film really opens your eyes to
Michael Moore's filmmaking art. Moore seriously felt that there was
something fishy going on, and honestly said what he felt: Bush is a
failure, and a war criminal, and that the Iraq War would've happened
regardless of 9/11. Plus, it was number one on its opening weekend
despite being in only 800 theaters. Impressive! I applaud Moore for
this masterpiece, and I hope that he can make more masterpieces like
this in the future.4/4

So I was watching Fahrenheit 9/11 in class yesterday, and I think it
throws up some very interesting questions that we all ought to think
about, and try and come up with our own thoughts, since I don't see
those as questions with definite answers. For those of you, who haven't
seen the movie yet, it's made by documentarian Michael Moore, and
focuses on the presidency of George W. Bush. Detailing the points in
his first four years of presidency which stood out the most, the film
was mostly critical of the actions taken during this time period, not
only by the President himself, but also of the media, and people who
were working for/were worked for by George W. Bush. Hope that wasn't
too confusing! Anyways, so I was watching the movie, and I was
thinking, some of it simply didn't match up. I mean, Michael Moore is
all critical about President Bush's actions, but if you look at it
realistically: How would you react when you are told that two airplanes
had crashed into a set of office buildings that signify the
capitalistic nature of the Western world? Keep in mind that you are
currently sitting in a classroom in an elementary school. I for one
would not be the person to change my demeanor, and announce the fact.
After all, you have to keep your cool around kids, since you don't know
how they would react. But I mean, okay, everyone reacts differently,
ole George and I might agree on this one, but others  Michael Moore,
for instance  certainly don't, but that's fine.Still, Mikey didn't give up that easily. Digging up facts about the
past, and connecting Bush with Saudi Arabian families directly
connected to Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda seemed impressive at first.
After doing a little research on the internet  prompted by a list of
things I found interesting in the movie  I found that Moore has been
evading interview opportunities with some of his harshest critiques 
usually he is all for opening his mouth and distributing his opinions,
is he not? And he was pretty subjective in the research he conducted,
considering that I think he wants to open up our eyes to the truth he
sees. I'm saying this because he omitted information about various
themes addressed in his documentary  questioning of the bin Laden
family when they were flown out of the United States AFTER
CONSIDERATION of the FBI.Of course there are things that kinda disturbed me with Fahrenheit
9/11, but I can't deny that it was well made, and of course there were
issues which I think were correctly represented, for instance the
portrayed heroism of both journalists and soldiers in the American
media. The bits of American soldiers, perhaps quoted out of context but
still this seems alarming to me, saying things like they put on music
when going out in their tanks, and usually listening to music which
either makes fun of the situation, or even seems disparaging in respect
to the Iraqis that are affected by the military presence. I harbor an
utter distaste toward that ass that was singing the song by the
Bloodhound Gang, full of enthusiasm.Another example exposed in the documentary, where I find it
embarrassing of how media blunders  considering that I plan on making
my career in the same self field  is the very beginning, where the
news stations are shown to predict Al Gore as the next President, and
after Fox News broadcast the prediction that George W. Bush was most
likely the next President, the other news stations followed suit. It
reminds me vividly of something we learned in Psychology called
'imprinting', where little ducklings learn to follow their Momma Duck,
otherwise they wouldn't survive. Now, I ask myself, why did those news
stations suffer under the strange hallucination that they were little
ducklings, instead of independent Momma Ducks? I really don't know
What is left to be said is that Fahrenheit 9/11 has certainly made me
think  both about negative points to the documentary, as well as
intriguing points raised by Mikey about the actions of the Bush
administration. Well filmed, it most certainly is a good watch, and I
recommend for everyone out there, especially you to watch it too, and
get your own opinion sorted!

Michael Moore tackles the controversial topic of the Bush
Administration, the terrorist attacks in September 2001, and the war in
Iraq that followed. When it comes to Michael Moore films, you need to
take the information he presents with a grain of salt. He presents his
information with HIS message in mind so facts can be presented out of
context to bring the viewer to the conclusions he wants. Despite this,
one has to admit that Moore presents a LOT of incriminating evidence
against George W. Bush and his connections between the oil industry and
the Saudi government (including the rich Bin Laden family). A person
can't deny that this movie provides it's viewers with some very
persuasive evidence that causes a person to question what their
government's intentions truly are, where they're priorities really lie.
Moore doesn't say anything that doesn't have some form of proof behind
it; anyone with the time to research the issue could've connected the
dots and seen the same troubling situations (i.e. the Bush family's
closeness to the Bin Ladens and the Saudis, Cheney and Halliburton,
etc.).I also appreciated how the movie gave us a closer look at those
directly affected by the war: the soldiers and their families. We hear
testimonies from soldiers serving terms in Iraq who have come to
realize that they're over there fighting for the wrong reasons; we hear
soldiers commenting on the terrible things they've had to endure and
perform in the line of duty. We see the effects of the war on Iraqi
citizens caught in the middle and it helps you begin to understand why
other countries view us the way they do. Probably the saddest portion
is watching Lila Lipscomb of Flint, MI, go from flag-waving patriotic
parent of two soldiers to a disillusioned mess when her son dies for a
war we had to right to start.Personally, I share a lot of the same viewpoints as Moore in his
portrayal of our government since 2001. While I support our troops with
everything in me, I fear they are dying for a ridiculous cause. I can't
watch this movie without it inspiring a bit of anger in me, having seen
the result of America's actions. I feel that everyone should see this
movie and form their OWN opinions based on the information presented,
but it is definitely a must-view for any American.

I remember seeing this in theatres as a Republican back in 2004. I
voted for Bush that year. Four years later, I voted for McCain. This
past election, I voted Libertarian, having come to the conclusion that
the major parties were too corrupt to trusted. It's been so long, we
keep forgetting the tenuous rationalizing, the weapons that were never
there, the freedom that nobody in the Middle East (except the elite, I
assume), ever got to benefit from. I've always been under the
impression that the world would be better if democracy spread
throughout it. But, you have to respect the ideals of that democracy,
or it's a democracy in name only. "We don't have time to read the
laws." 1 out of 535 representatives had a child fighting the war (and
probably against his parent's wishes). There was a time in America's
past (1870s-1900s) called the Gilded Age, where the government was
vastly corrupt and we fought wars for corporations (the
Spanish-American War of 1898, the annexation of the Philippines, etc).
The difference between now and then? Information. The internet. The
truth finds a way to get to you. I wouldn't presume to tell you how to
vote in any future elections, but I hope you stick your ideals when
doing so, and I hope you do not compromise those ideals in the name of
safety and I hope you do not withhold rights from other people because
their traditions and way of life is different from yours. That is all.

"Fahrenheit 9/11," Michael Moore's diatribe against the Bust
administration and how it used the public's post-9/11 fear and
insecurities to charge ahead with its dubious agenda, is about as
subtle as you would expect. But it's also fiercely entertaining and has
the power to enrage, characteristics that are pretty much synonymous
with any Moore documentary.People who did not live through the years immediately following 9/11,
or who were too young at the time to understand what was going on, will
never appreciate the degree to which our nation was polarized, a
polarization that was epitomized by two of the year's highest profile
films -- "Fahrenheit 9/11" and "The Passion of the Christ." It wasn't a
pleasant time to live through, but I'm glad I did, because I feel like
I was a part of history as it was happening.Grade: A

My problem with Michael Moore is not that I disagree with him, but the
fact that he is not fair. He simply distorts the truth and leaves out
important pieces of it. I realize that his point of view is legitimate
(not that I agree), but if he simply told the truth and defended his
position, I could take him seriously as a documentarian. Moore is all
about the shock value, which I know makes for a compelling film but not
a documentary. He is not the only one to do this; I have not seen a
good documentary in many years. A good documentary should be like a
argumentative essay. It should take on its subject head on and defeat
the opposition point by point. Moore's documentaries don't do this.
What makes it far worse is that so many film critics can't see this. It
makes me question film criticism.

Liberal flamethrower Michael Moore is a skilled propagandist, and not
above resorting to cheap tricks which certainly enliven 'Fahrenheit
911', his documentary about the Iraq war, but which could allow his
targets to suggest that he doesn't quite play fair. But there's nothing
fair either about the stupidity, venality and corruption of George Bush
and his associates, which Moore hilariously and chillingly presents in
this film. There's little here that seasoned observers of Bush won't
already know, but as evidenced by his recent re-election, there are
still plenty of Americans who would benefit greatly from learning the
facts. Although not as intellectually decisive as Ian Curtis in his
recent series for British television, 'The Power of Nightmares', when
Moore ends with a quote from George Orwell he hits the nail exactly on
the head. Four more years seems a long time indeed.

I'm not a member of either US political party. In fact, I despise the
two-party system. I don't like Bush. Don't hate him, but think he isn't
intelligent or strong. So I go see F 9/11 to find out what I don't know. What I discover is, very
little. Michael Moore is a man whose motivations I admire. But in F 9/11,
after seeing image after image that attempts to say something, anything,
negative about the Bush presidency but rarely actually gives proof of why we
should think that, I walk away feeling used.Oh, Moore shows us Bush is a timid man, possibly one who doesn't make a move
(literally, in one instance in a classroom) without an advisor, but really,
many top CEOs, movie stars and other in charge of large enterprises wait for
handlers and assistants to direct them, sometimes to a fault. And he talks
about the Bush family's connection to the Bin Ladens (old news for some).
And he shows soldiers and parents questioning the Iraq war (just as some did
over Vietnam and Korea). And then, in an odd twist, he returns to his Roger
& Me roots and goes to Flint, Michigan, where he makes the specific and
general point that the poor fight our wars while the elite (in this case,
kids of Congress members) don't. Gee, that was true in the Civil
War.OK, so maybe some people don't know this stuff, or haven't thought about it.
I can accept that. But the way Moore goes about making some of his points is
highly manipulative, on the order of the same things he seems to accuse the
Bush presidency of doing.[Minor spoilers] For instance, he spends a good 10-15 minutes on a woman
whose son was killed in Iraq, and on her and her family's grief. She
questions why he had to die, and even says what has become a cliche in these
case: "The parent should never have to bury the child." But while anyone
would have sympathy for this woman and her family, this is nothing new. It
happened during the Vietnam War. It happened during the Korean War.
Questioning the goals of the US in a war and grieving over lost lives didn't
start in 2003. And Moore knows this. But by spending so much time with this
woman and her family, Moore tries to emotionally affect -- manipulate -- the
viewer. This isn't about new information, or new ideas. This is about making
you feel a certain way by appealing to your human emotions. Hitler did it,
too. And it says absolutely nothing.Moore does the same with vets who have lost limbs, and even a Marine who
refuses to go back to Iraq. OK, fine. They feel that way. And it is a
terrible thing to lose limbs in a questionable war. Not a new thought, and I
hope these guys can lead happy lives. Next?Even the opening credits are designed to manipulate. They show members of
the Bush presidency having makeup applied before being interviewed on TV or
giving a speech. Ominous music plays in the background. Are we supposed to
think they are putting on their game faces, getting ready to perform? It is
hard to say. But the truth is, almost everyone who appears on TV --
including Moore -- has makeup applied. It is a visual medium. Bush is no
different. So?Finally, the mini-sermon about how the poor fight our wars is not only old
news, but it is easily explained. I graduated high school in the early 80s,
and even then I thought -- as did many of my peers -- that those who joined
the armed forces after high school did it largely because they had few
options. Almost no one who could go to college -- whether on a scholarship
or with financial aid or by paying themselves -- joined the military. It was
an option of last resort. It wasn't preferred, except by a small percentage
of people who wanted the military as a career (and these folks often went to
the academies). So, the fact that the poor fight our wars -- and that
recuiters go to places where they can find poorer people -- is not some
scheme. It is the way it works in our society. The only way to change it
would be to either enforce mandatory military service or pay the military so
much that people would choose it over other careers. Somehow I doubt Moore
would like either option.In the end, I left F 9/11 dissatisfied, and a little depressed. Because if
THIS was the movie that had so many people gasping, then those people either
haven't paid attention or don't think about things much. And that was the
saddest thought of all. I gave F 9/11 a 5.

Think to yourself why someone doesn't want you to see this movie? I
have seen many news medias tell us, that this movie is bad, they attack
Micheal Moore personally, they say the movie is all lies. I wonder why
they don't want the people to see it? Why they have fought, this movie
from coming out? Why have they fought, this movie from coming to your
local movie theater? Why would they fight so hard against a movie? I
did go see it! I cried, I laughed, I questioned, and I fought the knot
in my throat and stomach. I don't want you to believe everything you
see. Take a notebook with you. When you see something, you don't think
is true, write it down, then when you get home, get on your computer
and search for the answers. BTW, everything that the critics have said,
has been addressed and debunked on Micheal Moore's website also! But
don't take anyone's word for it, search for yourself and find the
answers, to the questions that you have. The thing that Moore
accomplishes above all in Fahrenheit 9/11 is to debunk the myth, that
people who do not support Bush also hate America. Moore gently kids
groups such as Peace Fresno, a group of sweatshirt-wearing, cookie
eating people who meet and discuss world peace. But he treats American
soldiers with deadly earnestness. He muses, not without a bit of awe,
that many of them come from impoverished sections of America, such as
his beloved hometown of Flint, Michigan. "They fight so that we don't
have to," he says. But if it gets people to start questioning their
leaders and asking how much we are willing to let them get away with,
then it will have done a service.

I just saw this the other day, Friday at rush hour, and was profoundly
moved. I had to hold back my tears during many of the more personable
parts, including the mother of the dead soldier. While I choked up,
others in the sold-out audience wept hard and loud. The movie was good,
and I do suspect that it will best Documentary again (compared to
Super-Size Me I almost positive) but, like most documentaries
(especially Super-size me) it was biased, but with just cause. Though I
did get tired off all the attacks on Bush, since we already know he's a
fool, I thought that overall it was a very, very powerful film, as I
said in the beginning with all the crying that could be heard. But, I
don't think he really nailed it, he did go after Halliburton, but even
after that he went on with the outright attack on Bush, causing more
laughter, but, I think he should have gone more after the companies
that own Bush and not cheap laughs at his stupidity. Don't get me
wrong, it was an awesome documentary, I like it better than Bowling,
but, what they didn't say was that even if Kerry wins, the companies
that own Bush have already switched to Kerry's side, (already!), and
now Kerry will just be the puppet for mass destruction. But, the good
thing is that we can hold Kerry closer to the fire, Bush is flame
retardant, no pun intended, but Kerry is much brighter, which could be
a bad thing, nonetheless, we can hold him much closer to the fire than
Bush ever was.Great documentary, really doing its job.

This is a documentary, but it's never dull. And though I've heard from
the other side that there are lies in the film, I've not seen a
challenge of anything specific.Indeed, the film is mostly a string of news clips of Bush, Cheney,
Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell and Moore lets them speak for themselves with
damning results. There is some narration by Moore, and the other most
heard opposition is from Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) who is a
psychiatrist and describes the Bush admin applied Machiavellian
strategy. The film is an emotional roller coaster, goes from laughter to tears,
and even an occasional fright. Great soundtrack. Obviously I recommend
this film. I think that Michael Moore has done a great public service.

Even if you strip away the politics, this is still an amazing film.
Moore has finally grown up. There is little of the smug, snottiness of
his previous films here. He lets his images tell the story -- and a
powerful story it is.There are moments of real humor -- even Moore poking fun at himself.
There are moments of revelation: Lila Lipscombe's journey of
understanding is nothing less than stunning. There are images that are
so hard to look at I had to close my eyes.I don't ever remember seeing a movie, documentary or otherwise, where
the audience stood up and applauded at the end. They did in the showing
I went to.Before I saw it, I believed it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes because the
French hate George Bush. Now that I've seen it, I know it was a fairly
won award.

Moore does what numerous others in pages of books and hours of
interviews have been unable to do. He takes a complicated web of deceit
and puts it together in a way that people can understand. He cuts
through the lies, shows the hypocrisy, and levels the political playing
field. Neither Democrats nor Republicans are spared in this film, which
looks at the nation in crisis, brought on by its own heads of state.
Kudos to Michael Moore!In addition, I am especially impressed with Moore's refusal to make
this movie into a Kerry-campaign message. In fact, the Democrats take
the heat, too. We citizens were misled and forced into this war; I
remember as the war drums were beating last year, not feeling like I
could say anything critical of it. I have never felt oppressed in this
country until that moment, and I am glad that Howard Dean broke the
ice, that Michael Moore has kept the dialogue going. I just hope that
this whole thing turns into a real discourse in which all leaders are
criticized, including the Democratic candidate. Our government is in a
stranglehold by the monied elite, and it is time to take it back.
Thanks, Michael!

By wasting American resources, military, and lives waging a war having
nothing to do with either Al Qaeda or terrorism, George Bush has
detracted from our efforts to fight the real "war on terrorism", and
has actually aided Al Qaeda in their efforts to win over new supporters
throughout the world.George Bush's decisions have led directly to major increases in threats
to American interests and security world wide. If that doesn't fit the
definition of a "traitor", then the word has no meaning.Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a funny, serious, moving and
powerful work that throws a glaring spotlight upon the stratagems and
lies orchestrated by the Bush administration, exposing perhaps the most
corrupt government in our lifetime!

Love him or hate him, Michael Moore presents facts and images in ways that we as Americans have never seen before.  His latest endeavor, Fahrenheit 9/11, will go down in history as the film that helped to bring down a corrupt and dangerously inept administration.The film's power lies not in it's statistics or it's director's obvious message but in it's ability to make one laugh, make one cry and make one think.  I did all three numerous times during the film and I will never be the same again.He managed to put a human face on our 'evil enemy', the men, women and children of Iraq who are suffering endlessly due to the prolonged occupation of a foreign power.  I, as an American, am shielded from images of Iraqi mothers crying and holding their dead babies.  Images of charred and battered bodies lying in groups on a roadside.  Images of pre-Invasion Iraq that, while not perfect, had amusement parks and cafes and discos and  shopping malls but now those things, along with their food, water, electricity and loved ones, is gone.Mr. Moore highlighted the nefarious way George W. Bush came to power in this country, almost under the cover of night and how he has spent the most time on vacation than any American president in history despite presiding over one of the most tumultuous times ever.The scope of the film touched on the poor, the elderly, the veterans who, when they come back to home, have their benefits cut off by the same president that claims to care so much about them.I am neither democrat nor republican (both parties have their problems) but as an American I thank Michael Moore for opening my eyes and letting me see the truth for myself so that I may make up my own mind.I firmly believe that every single American should see this film. Conservative.  Liberal.  It doesn't matter.  If you claim to love this nation, you should bear witness to one of the most important American films ever made.

Follow up on Moore's claims to see if they add up. I find that they
don't. For instance:9/11: Moore's attempt to make it appear that Bush's (in)actions were
what allowed 9/11 to happen.What that leaves out: Bush authorized the arming of Predator drones
before 9/11, something Clinton hadn't done. He also was scheduled to
sign into effect a plan to wage a covert war against Al Qaeda right
around 9/11. This is despite his government being only partially filled
out and burdened by Clinton holdovers due to Democrat obstructionism in
the Senate after the recount controversy. Clinton hadn't even clarified
whether the CIA and military had legal authorization to kill Bin Laden
on sight. I'm not opposed to Bush taking even more action than he did,
but these were all things Clinton had refused to do. This is meaningful
when you consider that Bush did all this in eight months, despite
Senate Democrats foot dragging and slowing the filling of his
government. Killing Bin Laden in 2001 wouldn't have stopped the 9/11
terrorist attacks anyway, but I think it's safe to say it's a shame
Bush hadn't been in office longer.Halliburton: Moore implies that Bush invaded Iraq to, among other
things, award a no-bid contract to Cheney's former company,
Halliburton.What that leaves out: Halliburton is one of less than a handful of
companies in the world (and the only American one) capable of providing
the services that Halliburton provides. Also, past Presidents have
awarded no-bid contracts to Halliburton, including Clinton during the
Kosovo conflict. Furthermore, Cheney donates most of the dividends from
his Halliburton stock to charity.These are just a couple.Also worthy of note: http://FreedomKeys.com/whyiraq.htm

Michael Moree is one o the greatest political instigators of our time
and really i think that he should be taken seriously. The movie it self
is a great documentary about the Bush administration , and the problems
that Michael Moore poses are actual and extremely true. I don't want to
make this message a political one , but really everyone should see this
film because it reveals the political status of the U.S.A . You should
really ask you're self sometimes if those really are the leaders that
we choose to represent us , if those really are the perfect people the
lead your lives . The movie talks about the political manipulation and
greed for power. It really is a true drama.

Check out this film if you want the Government-Approved watered-down
version of what happened regarding the Destruction of the Twin Towers.
Moore fails to address why on 9/11, our air defenses at Norad were told
to stand down, or by whom... so if you want the fat-cat imitation of
radical journalism, exposing the pre-approved issues, waste your time
and money on this cheap rip-off of Alex Jone's independent documentary
"911:THE ROAD TO TYRANNY". The difference when watched side-by-side is
this: Moore pretends to care about truth, and dishes it out in tiny
bite-sized pieces mixed with lots of opinion gravy; while Alex Jones
lays it all out in front of you like a big juicy steak, which some
people may have a hard time chewing, but Jones spares nowone in his
pursuit of truth. Fahrenheit is not nearly as good as a much earlier
Michael Moore Documentary called "Blood in the Face," which I consider
a "must see." Bottom line on Fahrenheit is: If you want the fluff, see
Moore; but if you want the stuff, see "Road to Tyranny."

The only real reason that I set the video for this film when it was on
Channel 4 last Thursday was to basically see what all the fuss was
about. I remember vividly seeing Michael Moore's "stunning" acceptance
speech at the Osacrs when he won Best Documentary for "Bowling For
Columbine". I also remember watching said film and actually quite
enjoying it. So, hoping to get the same experience from this movie as I
had done for his previous one, I settled down to watch this.I did not enjoy this film. Simply and honestly, I did not enjoy this
film at all. For a British person this film has very little relevance
to our society. I can understand clearly how relevant it would be to an
American audience, of course, but this went too far in their direction.
At least "Bowling" had some relevance - we have had a number of school
shootings over here, such as the 1996 Dunblane tragedy. This film was
too heavy on the gore and war footage for my tastes, but in a way this
was a good thing. Not enjoyably, but politically. At the end of the
day, this is after all an anti-war movie.It also happens to be an anti-Bush movie, and this is where the biggest
faults lie. It just is anti-Bush, anti-Bush, anti-Bush...AUGH!!! Enough
already! It is clear that you don't like this man, Moore, but you don't
have to shove it down our throats! If you're going to make an anti-Iraq
war movie, then why didn't you mention the fact that the British ARMY
HAVE ALSO FOUGHT ALONG SIDE THE Americans AND DIED ALONG WITH THE
Americans??? Sorry, but that really takes the biscuit. It's like all
these WW2 movies where the Yanks saved the world from the evil
Nazis...WHAT ABOUT THE FLIPPING British?Ahem. Of course, you may be wondering why I have given this movie 5/10
if I didn't enjoy it. The answer is simple: criticism. Political
criticism. For what it's worth, this is a good example of the evil of
politics and the true villainy and utter stupidity that we face in the
Western world in terms of our leaders. The fact that we have this man
as one of the most powerful in the world is scary enough without the
film's examples! Coming up next: Farenheit 9/11 Re-Loaded: The Tony
Blair Witch Project.5/10

If you didn't hate Bush before, you do now. Nothing but criticism and
blameworthy discussions about the president. There are a lot of
persuasive parts in the movie that make you question your trust for
Bush, but overall, Michael Moore tries too hard. The movie was so long
that I didn't feel like watching debates.We all know that Bowling for Columbine was considered a false ending
and a bribery for the handicapped, and for all we know Fahrenheit 9/11
is the same thing. You have to understand that lash outs at Bush,
doesn't necessarily make John Kerry seem much better.Mr. Moore, next time you want to make a documentary, please, hit
yourself over the head with a shovel, and ask yourself what the output
would be if you opened your opinionated mouth again.4 out of 10.

I know that a lot of Republican pundits have savagely attacked this film as
being a distortion of the truth. Heck, some of those people have actually
seen the film, not many, but some. Does Moore despise George W. Bush? You
bet! Does he hope to tarnish his image with this film? You bet! Does that
mean that this film is propoganda, which seeks to distort the truth? Well,
let's see. Is the mother who lost her son in this war a distortion? She was
military through and through, a flag waving supporter of troops, whose
family had more than given to the cause. She turns out to be one of the
biggest opponents of the war and Bush. Is she being distorted? Is that Moore
feeding her lines? What about the many soldiers that talk about how they
were mislead and can think of nothing but leaving a "bogus" war? What about
the Bush lies in which he continued to tie Bin Laden with Saddam? When in
reality, the Bush family has much closer ties to Bin Laden that Huessein.
War has always been used by despots for control of the masses. Give the
people an enemy, raise an army and keep people scared and loyal. However, as
this war wages on, all I can remember seeing are those Halliburton suits,
throwing parties and delighting in the amount of money they were going to
make off of this tragedy. The bottom line is the money to be made, not the
lives that have been and will be lost. In this country, people say that if
you are not supporting the President and the war, you are not patriotic.
Well, if patriotic is one that blindly follows a liar and a thief, call me a
traitor.

I saw this for free which was the only way I was going. A friend had
bought advanced tickets and couldn't go at the last minute. A
documentary belongs on TV, the big screen actually detracts from it.
Anyway, I sat with a whole bunch of people who quickly became bored
when they realized that this wasn't a movie, hype or not. The film
itself stunk, nothing but comments over rehashed news clips. The Daily
Show and the cable news channels do this everyday...and a lot better.
Moore presents a very weak case that Bush is in cahoots with the
Saudis, made all the weaker by news stories that have come out in the
past few months. I liked Roger and Me quite a bit but Moore has gone
steadily downhill since then. Someone needs to remind him that when you
make a documentary it's about OTHER people. Thank God Lucas & Spielberg
don't jump in front of the camera as much as this guy. Save your money
and wait till this hits cable and you are REALLY bored.

I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I left determined to act for change.This is not a balanced look at George Bush's presidency, and it's not
supposed to be. This is a good, old-fashioned rock-em sock-em
polemic--political commentary and a call for action, carried off in
Michael Moore's trademark irreverent style.Its imagery swings between goof (Paul Wolfowitz and his comb) and gore
(footage of wartime carnage)and its commentary deftly contrasts this
regime's red, white, and blue rhetoric with the greed and cronyism
behind its rise to power. I hope the success of this film will
encourage more filmmakers to translate outrage into art. Bravo, Michael!

First of all, let me say that I come to this movie with a decidedly
biased viewpoint: I didn't like Bush before I saw this movie. However,
I don't see how you can question the validity of it. The film was
compiled of real footage, and it was sewn together brilliantly. Moore
makes several very good points which we can not afford to ignore.However, I don't want this review to turn too political (if that's
possible). The fact is, I gave Fahrenheit 9/11 a 10 because it was very
funny, very sad, and extremely interesting. No matter who you are, this
movie will move you (at least I hope that's true). Moore has achieved a
decided mastery of the documentary film genre (although some wouldn't
call it that). His team finds amazing footage and manages to sew it
together in the most effective way possible.No matter your political view, you should go see this movie, and watch
it with an open mind; it's going to effect the political atmosphere in
our country for several years. By the way, remember to vote!!

Don't confuse this as an educated look at the issues. This is a Rush
Limbaugh like distortion of the facts to try to establish a
predetermined belief. Moore did not gather the facts and then come to a
conclusion, he came to a conclusion and then gathered facts that proved
his conviction. He may be a good filmmaker... but he is so obsessed
with hatred for Bush he is consumed with trying to degrade them by any
means at his disposal. A movie should be entertaining or at least
educational. Unfortunately this one is neither. A documentary weighs
the facts and comes to an educated conclusion. This movie takes an
emotional feeling and tries to dig up any facts to justify that
emotion. Don't waste your time on this one!

Michael Moore, being a large fellow is almost certainly prone to having
an odor problem "down there". Due to his morbid obesity, he sweats more
than the average person. The more obese the person, the more skin they
have, and if they have more skin then they are certain to have more
sweat glands, no? You see where I'm going with this. The obese body
also has many flabby crevasses in which bacteria can proliferate.
Bacteria reproduces most rapidly when enjoying a warm, dark, and humid
environment with limited oxygen. Starting to sound familiar? This ideal
environment for bacterial reproduction can easily be found. Well...
"Down there". The bottom line is: Don't take political advice from a
man who in unable to govern his own hygiene.

I was sooo excited to see this movie when it was about to come out. I
thought it looked funny and witty. Nope.I'm not a democrat or a republican, I'm more libertarian than anything.
I don't especially care for Bush, or Kerry for that matter but thats
another story. I think that the war in Iraq was a little rushed, but ya
know, despite what the hippies say, oil is a fair commodity.With all of my political opinions aside, I think that the movie failed
where it could have really been succeeded: applying good information. I
don't give a sh*t about some memo blacking out Bush's buddy's name, I
don't give a sh*t about John Ashcroft singing some half-assed patriotic
song. If I'm gonna go see a movie about how Bush sucks, then goddamn

really does make it seem like he hates America.Whatever, I just though the movie was bland.5 out of 10.

OK, Let's cut to the chase with a few aesthetic and otherwise
classified bla bla in the cinematic sense, and then wrap it up in a
bow. But just realize that this isn't really a movie reviewit's just
some bla bla about this moviewhich I just saw. Ps, I don't think there
are any 'spoilers' in this text, but if you are worried, just don't
read it.The cut to the chase:1. The soundtrack was totally hilarious for 10 minutes, then it became
the underling theme for 'hey, it's joe-key joke time' that never became
'hi larious' as intended (I mean they didn't even use the original
versions of The Animals or The Whoeven with the set up of 'won't get
fooled again' as the big 'rock' launching pad, for which they could
only procure some 'reprise' versionwhich harshed my stuff. Apparently,
Cadillac or Lincoln or some derivative has the Rights on that one. And
they totally ham- it-up with the bonanza 'hee-haw' bit where they make
Bush look like a moronwow, I didn't realize that Conan O'Brian wrote
the setups for Late Night will Michael Moore). But I have to admit -
there are a few choice cuts like the theme song from American HeroCa,
c'est beau.2. The bit about the family from Flint, MI that lost their son is -
although the first piece of film that honestly made me cry since I
don't know whenmaybe Slingblade - is completely unfair. This family's
pain is something I hope I never have to suffer through and I am deeply
sorry for them and all like them, but the directing is exploitation and
vicious on this storyline, and therefore, bogus.3. The voice-overs and imagery are often inappropriateor
ratherunsuccessful, in the sense that Moore hopes to assume the
narrative role of someone other than himself, (for instance the opening
'it is only a dream, or is it?' preface/opening sequence) while
maintaining the 'it hits home' reality bites angle. But in affect, this
just makes the narration sound too tabloid and preachywith leading
questions that just prove that there are some good people and some bad
people - way to uncover the universal truth there, captain.4. The stuff about who is in the-'coalition of the willing' is racist,
or was that ironically ironicor otherwise one of the permutations of
ironically ironic characterizational improvisationsor maybe it was
just that 'feel good' filler material, intended to provoke some cheap
laughs to keep the audience engaged? What about the alignment with
Spain and the UK? I'm sure there is some free footage of 'Benny Hill'
on the net somewhere, non? That piece was as Anti-Hollywood as you can
get. Je ne sais pas, mais on y va.5. And as much as I can't believe I write this, the low-blows to the
Mtv 'sweet sixteens' and their apparent spokespeeps Britney stuff and
Rickie Manudo, is not fairthey're not on trialbut no matter how you
set it up and frame it, the Britney stuff was right-on. The front row
laughed at that point.Well, I could probably write about this thing all night. But that would
be tiring, and we like to 'take it easy' chez nous. The thing is, is
that I just saw this flick at the 9:45 show and now it is totally 4:55
in the morningand it is still on my mind obviously(or else I would be
in my warm bed right now, and that is the stuff).But regardless of however my initial, politically-changed, yet
hopefully-subjective bla bla might appear to a reader of such things,
understand that after I hit 'submit' and all the 'email tone'
floodgates have been all flooded and stuff, (with apologies for the
cliché sap you are about to sip) I will remain an American - that will
not change no matter which questions bla bla and what who what why
where bla bla. The Paul Simon:This is an important film on the whole, and it is a must see I 'spose.
But I wanted to come to know something marvel after this 'Salle un'
tony danza extravaganza, which did not happen with Fahrenheit 911. And
that - is a disappointment. If he could only go 'TO THE YEAR 2000',
maybe his predictable and sometimes bombers of 'hot-to-the- touch' bla
bla would be potent, instead of the contrary.But y'know, I still have respect for this guy because this film is bold
and it takes some of those things that AC/DC talk about in that song of
theirs (that bonnie billy totally mucked up really mucki-like) to make
a thing like this realand that is the real deal. That is to say that
this guy is making noisewhich is redeemable and commendable but the
filmpas.

I've seen all of Moore's films. From the very first one, I could see
way down the road an agenda on the mind of Michael Moore. He was angry,
but no where to vent. So, he enters film. Wish he hadn't. There's
enough junk being pumped out of Hollywood already that's geared for
nothing more than making a buck via sensationalism. Moore is a master
at this, but doesn't excuse him being just another big fat idiot
occupying space on Earth. We have all the big fat idiots we can
stomach. Was that a pun? Anyway, since Moore has made the
big-time(another pun?), he's only become completely insufferable.
"Fahrenheit 9/11" gives us a glimpse of what might have happened to
Waters if "Pink Flamingos" had won an academy award. There's just no
stopping insanity when it's on a roll. I thought that "Naked Lunch" was
the most depraved meaningless film I ever saw until I previewed
"Bowling for Columbine", but "Fahrenheit 9/11" takes the cake. Here is
a sprawling panorama of self-indulgent, condescending garbage bent on
maligning the President and country that filled Moore's pockets so much
so that he can afford to super-size all his meals now. Living off the
fat of the land(was that another pun?)and giving nothing in return. No
glory to "Old Glory" in this flick. Just another big fat idiot venting
childish anger while he bites the hand that feeds. Was that yet another
pun? Save your hard earned cash and wait until it hits the buck
theaters if you just have to watch someone make a fool out of
themselves.

film, not the movie that earned 20smth 000 000 at it's first weekend, but
something completely different, a lousy attempt to reveal the truth' about
one of the most-hated presidents ever - Mr. Bush. But the fact is  we all
knew this before! Well, at least I knew it. But, you may say that almost all
documentaries are about facts that are known to mankind. Well,  Michel
Moore's previous controvercial documentary Bowling for Columbine was though
also fake and insincere, was at least witty and even clever at times, and
the brief history of the US' was simply hilarious.      In this movie Mr. Moore tries to be your good-fat-buddy', he seems to
be so frank and sincere that we can not not beleive him. If he says Mr.Bush
is bad' and Saddaam (sp?) is innocent', than we belive him, but once
again, WE KNEW IT!!! This movie is not even trying to be witty, just bare
facts narrated by fat-millionaire-Moore.  I just can not believe how his guy
managed to make the jury at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival so blind, that
they gave this movie a 20smth minute standing aviation and the main prize.
The movie end with Moore trying to persuade MPs to send their sons to Iraq. 
Doesn't this remind you of something? Yes, You are right, it's Michael's
tradition to finish his movie with an honest' speech and with an unfinished
interview/chat.     Let me hasten to add, that I gave this movie a 4 because Moore showed us
nothing new, just made a movie so that he could be called an American Hero,
who opened the eyes of simple Americans on their evil' President. I don't
know how couldn't people in the US not know this, we here in Europe knew it
for a long time.

When even the IMDB voting is political . . .You cannot believe anything
anybody tells you about this movie.  Even the voting on IMDB is strictly
political:  Over 91% of the IMDB voters gave it either 1 or a 10, and a
whopping 97.25 % gave it it either a 1, 2, 9, or 10 (out of 3159 before my
vote was cast).  If you see it with a liberal bend it will confirm your worst fears (Bush
really is the antichrist and conspires with Osama Bin Laden).  If you see it
with a conservative bend you'll see it as mere propaganda (that must have
been editing trickery because Bush would never be flippant about the 911
attacks).  If you're just looking for entertainment, it's mediocre at best. 
If you're looking to be informed, turn on CNN, FoxNews, MSNbc, or better
yet: PBS.  It's not great, but it's not awful, but don't believe me (see above). 
Either see it or don't, but between this and The Day After Tomorrow, I just
wish the media would stop wasting our time making a big deal talking about
what turn out to be mediocre movies.

Micheal Moore is a great story teller. Has been since TV Nation. The
problem is, the movies he makes are not documentaries. Their have been
more people saying he misquoted, embellished, and flat out lied about
what they said. Even to point where he would ask a person questions and
edit their answers to fit what he wanted them to say. Some of the
answers in Bowling for Columbine are to questions never included in the
movie. And for the record, I don't like George Bush. After Fahrenheit
911, however, I've found that Micheal Moore has little more credibility
than the dirty politicians he both supports and condemns. This is not a
documentary, it is a political propaganda piece, and should be treated
that way. I support Disney for not dirting its hands with this.Don't vote for president in 2004. Then maybe both parties will realize
what jack___es they have selected as Candidates.

While I suppose Mr. Moore's film is loaded with accuracies,I have to
take time to disagree with his assessment that President Bush did
anything wrong in the Florida classroom on the day of the attacks.To
me, his actions were just.Yes,this was a national emergency to say the
least,but number one,this was a classroom full of children that had put
a lot of hard work into preparing for our president,and wanted to
impress him.Perhaps he didn't want to let them down.Secondly,he didn't
want to act abruptly and start unnecessary panic amongst these kids.I
just think that the assumption that he was so stunned that he didn't
know what to do is absurd and unfounded.This is my only major
disagreement with the film.Setting aside personal political beliefs is
hard to do with this film,and I feel that most reviewers will not do
it, and it will play a part in their calling it good or bad.I will set
my own beliefs aside and say that it is not a bad film,but being a
person who likes to be entertained by movies and doesn't like them to
be loaded with current events,it's not one that I would care to own.

A very good idea for a movie. However, the writing and imagery is
childish and poorly executed. The movie is condescendingly spoon-fed
nonsense. What a shame for such a serious issue! What is even more
ridiculous is that the author chose to describe this movie as a
"documentary". It is a poor description because it is heavily biased
despite the use of "real" footage.This film lacks common sense. I feel sorry for anyone who gets anything
out of this movie.......other than a good chuckle.The most annoying thing is that this movie is voiced-over by Michael
Moore himself. His voice is nasally and irritating. He should have had
the common sense to have someone else narrate. At the very least,
someone on his staff should have had the sense to inform him that he
doesn't have a good speaking voice.I hope they improve this for the new 2007 release.

I have seen "Bowling for Columbine" and found it to be interesting and
perhaps even entertaining, but its owner is one of the most repulsive
figures in the business. That's the feeling I took into watching
Fahrenheit 9/11. That this film earned a "Palm d'Or" at Cannes tells me
that the Golden Palm is no longer a guide to great film making, but a
political vote cast by a liberal camp. Michal Moore conducts interviews
with bait & switch questions, conclusion drawn from totally irrelevant
statements and journalism without context. While this film did give me
cause think about the Iraq war and terrorism in general, it left me
feeling that I was watching a video of some internet conspiracy theory
that had gone on too long. As he did in Columbine, he duped people into
looking foolish, paraded grief as some special insight and conducted a
strident, personal vendetta directed toward GWB. Though I don't agree
with all of the administrations decisions and policies conducted in the
Middle East or even many of the "Homeland Security" vs. freedom
implications, I could not give any credence to this biased, poorly
assembled, piece of propaganda. Perhaps propaganda was the category
under which the Palm d'Or was awarded and in that case, it may have
been deserved. I awarded this effort 3 of 10 based on its ability to
raise controversy, but wouldn't recommend that people actually view it,
unless there was nothing else on.

I will not duplicate all the documented lies told in this film, but
since it is in the guise of a documentary and it is far from that, I
give it a low rating. It is entertaining. One thing that really puzzles
me is why anybody is surprised about Bush telling reporters to watch
his drive. Interview a guy on a golf course and that is what you get
isn't it? Funny though. I was a fan of Moore's film, especially his
early works, but I don't feel that he is trustworthy now. Asking a
senator, "Will you sign up your kid for the armed forces" is a bit
silly since anybody who did join did so on their own and not because of
their parents. I wish Moore would use his talents to make compelling
documentary films rather than make agenda films disguised as
documentary film.

I have no problem with documentaries being biased. I think it's
inevitable that any presentation of material will always favor certain
conclusions. This movie, however, far from being a well-researched,
thought-provoking piece, is inane and insulting. Here are three simple
examples:1) After a Senator refuses to "enlist" his son in the Armed Forces,
Michael Moore essentially makes the "see-I-told-you-so" argument that
the Senators will recruit people relentlessly from Flint, Michigan, but
won't sign their own sons and daughters up. This makes no sense for
several reasons. First, why would you ever be allowed to sign someone
else up for the armed forces? Secondly, the Senator in question SERVED
IN THE NAVY. He SIGNED HIMSELF UP.And he talks about it with Michael Moore and the Marine Corporal
accompanying him. So Michael Moore's point is completely lost in that
episode.2) One of the major themes of the movie is that the White House (and
especially President Bush) is in bed with the Saudi royal family. He
uses this hypothesis to circumstantially explain all kinds of things,
without any support for his claim that resembles "evidence". If the
Saudi royal family exerts so much influence over US policy, why did it
allow the United States to open up its largest potential oil-producing
competitor (Iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world)? This
doesn't make sense. A movie that brings up issues like this without
touching even such cursory and obvious points of contention is
simplistic and insulting to its viewer. It assumes its viewer knows
nothing about the world and will accept whatever speculation the movie
offers as truth.3) The opening of the movie claims that all the major analyses of the
Florida election results show Al Gore would have won. This just plain
isn't true. There were three major studies done on this issue. One
concluded that has the votes been counted accurately (as in a
hand-recount), Al Gore would have won. The other two studies concluded
that Bush WOULD HAVE WON BY MORE. Michael Moore taunts his viewers and mocks them. Either because of his
own ignorance or his desire to manipulate, he created a movie which
manipulates, obscures, and misleads. This is precisely what he accuses
the Bush administration of doing. Because I remember history, read the
papers, and study these issues, it is blindingly obvious to me how
deceptive the movie is and how much it both preys upon people who don't
have time to do the research themselves and insults those who do.

Who lived in not-so-free country knows the smell when propaganda begins
to rise her head. This film is full of it.In past many people have seen such films in Europe and believed them,
just to see how much they were wrong when it was to late. It was to
late to change the system. At least not without big sacrifices. Thousands of people lives, thousands of families split apart, thousands
of children without childhood. Everybody had at least a drop of hope,
because people in America were still free, with no bonds. But now some
are putting their freedom down, just to knee down before an old stupid
propaganda film, like never seen since old times of Stalin

Thanks Moore for making this movie so we could know the "truth" thats
what this is for right it couldn't be just so Moore could make more
money off of a terrible tragedy right? Moore is a disgusting humanbeing
it makes me sick to think there is actually a person this bad that he
attempts to make a career out of tragedy.This is basically Moore trying to get rich and trying to say its him
telling the truth about bush. The truth about bush is he is a good
president he may not be the best but he is certainly not the worst an
he is much better then Kerry could ever be. So Moore please when there
is another terrible tragedy please don't try to make millions off of it
please.

I've read all of these critics given this film high marks, and I
couldn't understand it at first. Until I realized that they were mainly
critiquing Moore's film techniques. I guess in those terms, the film is
good. But there is one problem. This film is supposed to be a
documentary. Documentaries are supposed to be a kind of film that
presents factual information or ideas based in fact. Moore's film is
NOT a documentary because it does neither. Its an editorial piece,
meaning its an expression of opinion that does not necessarily have to
be based on fact. This should not be called a documentary.Now, the big problem with this film-it is full of falsehoods and
misleading distortions of the facts. For example-the film presents the
conclusion that the U.S. went into Afghanistan to put in an oil
pipeline. Those who think that oil companies are the root of all evil
will agree with it. But there is one problem-there is absolutely no
factual evidence that this is true, while there is overwhelming
evidence that the U.S. went into Afghanistan to get the people who sent
terrorists to kill thousands of people in New York and Washington.Can Michael Moore say that he believes we went to Afghanistan to get an
oil pipeline? Sure. I can say that John Kerry married a member of the
Heinz family because he likes ketchup. It doesn't make either true,
because there is no evidence supporting either conclusion. Now, here's
the rub. Moore uses a technique of going to people and asking them a
general question, then using that as evidence of some specific claim.
It would be like me finding an interview with Kerry where he is eating
a burger with ketchup on it, and my using that as evidence that he
married his wife because he likes ketchup.2+2 does not equal 10. That's why Moore's film is so full of crap.He also used editing techniques which deliberately set out to make
American soldiers and President Bush look evil. He shows footage of
dead Iraqis and women crying over the bodies of their dead loved ones.
Then, he immediately cuts to footage of American soldiers saying how
they like the adrenaline rush when they go into a firefight. Then, he
shows more footage of dead Iraqis, then shows President Bush laughing,
at what we don't know.What I want to know is-where is the footage of American soldiers
wounded with arms and legs blown off in Iraq? Wouldn't that be a good
anti-war statement for Moore to use? He doesn't. Why? Well, let me make
a statement based on some evidence. He doesn't care about the American
soldiers who have died in the war. What's my evidence? In Caen, he told
reporters that he hopes more American soldiers die in Iraq, to teach
America a lesson. Does that sound like someone who cares about wounded
or killed American soldiers, by hoping there will be more?Back during the Monika Lewinsky scandal of the Clinton administration,
Hillary Clinton spoke of a "vast right-wing conspiracy" to get her
husband. I think there is clear evidence that was true. But now,
America faces a vast left-wing conspiracy to get President George W.
Bush, made up of people in the media, editors of major newspapers, and
Hollywood types, all of whom do not like President Bush and
conservatives like him. They know that the big issue of this election
is not going to be jobs or the economy or the environment. The
statement "its the economy, stupid" does not apply in the world we live
in now. The big issue of the election will be the war on terror
conducted by the Bush administration from 9/11/01 to now, in
Afghanistan, Iraq, here in America, and in other places. This is an
area where Bush is strongest. But Bush is not a very articulate person,
so its hard for him to combat attacks on him that are not necessarily
based in fact. So, the vast left-wing conspiracy can use
mis-information campaigns against him with greater ease than they could
against, say, Reagan during the 1980's.Michael Moore is a part of that conspiracy, and this propaganda film is
his contribution to the left-wing's efforts to remove Bush from the
presidency. His techniques are Stalin-like in their use of
mis-information and twisting of historical evidence. Don't believe the
mis-information. Don't bother seeing this film.

Wow.   The greatest piece of Left Wing liberalism dogma I have ever seen. 
Mr. Moore uses every ounce of creative force he has to prove that what he
said at his Oscar acceptance speech was true...in his opinion.  This is way
too one sided for me, and obviously Moore has an ax to grind with President
Bush, as well as an ego the size of the Grand Canyon to prove he was right. 
You will love it if you are a bleeding heart liberal, despise it if you are
a hate-mongering right winger and think what I think if you are somewhere in
the middle which is that it is too one-sided.  No wonder why leftist
Hollywood loves this film.  And Moore should have gotten Mr. Bradbury's
approval before he ripped off the name of his genius book.  No class at
all.

I am a nurse and I have to say that I haven't seen such terrible sights
in my entire career. This movie showed a living breathing human being
get beheaded (no cutaway, just the entire beheading including chopping
at the neck twice), showed 2 men burnt to a crisp and hung, showed dead
bodies in various stages of decomposition and conditions, showed up
close detailed photography of children with body parts blown up or
blown off.I really don't think all this blood guts and tasteless film should have
been shown publicly. No wonder it got an "R" rating.I am disgusted by Michael Moore using this film to propagate such
atrocities.

I honestly can't stress how dangerous this film is. In his usual way Moore
presents legit facts in ways and with images that make you think 2+2=4. I
myself left the theatre feeling quite disturbed, mixed-up and not proud to
be a US citizen. Fortunately, once you are out of the theatre and have had
time to think, which hopefully you will do, logic steps in and you see a bit
more clearly.
 It's the visuals that are in bad taste in my opinion. We are subject to
many of the worst images associated with war and we should be disturbed but
that in and of itself doesn't mean that we should never go to war. The truth
is that Michael Moore could make a very convincing film about how he himself
profited from the events of 9/11 but you won't see that. Instead you will
see him doing this same number on our President. Let's not forget that Mr.
Moore is a multi-millionaire at the expense of folks losing jobs in Mich,
kids dying at Columbine and now those who died in New York and Iraq. Michael
Moore has not and probably never will give a sizable portion of the profits
from his films or books to the victims he likes to exploit. These are not
non-profit undertakings. He has made more than enough money to never have to
work again and be much more profitable than those unfortunates he first
showed us in Flint, MI. You'd have to look a long way to find such
hypocrisy.
Please remember when you watch this film that Michael Moore will be making
millions off the events he is presenting to you.

Cynical Everyman Michael Moore does yeoman's work in his latest attack
on "The Man." Sensational, yes, but in an eagerly awaited installment
of our great social debate, our man fires blanks in a target-rich
environment. We have been served one man's Jihad for more self-absorbed
attention and box office returns wrapped in an MTV bun without the
fixings. In this episode, instead of General Motors or the NRA, Mikey's sites
are set on a branch of American Royalty, the Bushes, and his
emotionally-based conclusions, like the dog, just don't hunt.Production values have improved with Mikey's journey along the road to
truth, justice and the American Way, but a once promising sage of our
nation's foibles has lost his way. Like a Robert Ludlum novel, he sees
conspiracies, and like Ludlum in his older years, the contrived and
artificial story line has become tedious in the telling.America's favorite counter-culture millionaire has thrown gasoline on
the flames of self-righteousness. If the topic wasn't so serious, the
scope and breadth of this film would pass as a national lampoon of the
first order. As it is, Mikey has so muddled the facts that the most
compelling discussion of our day has slipped the grasp of this once
grand story teller. He coulda, woulda, shoulda, but didn't.I winced when Elvis took the stage in later years, a diminished
reminder of the brilliant talent that once was. I give Farenheit 9/11 a
very disappointed *1/2 out of **** stars with the * going to the memory
of the King.

Before I start, don't get me wrong, before watching this movie I had
nothing against Michael Moore, quite the opposite. I had a lot of
respect for him. I quite enjoyed "Bowling for Columbine" and felt it
was a well-made documentary.That being said, I was terribly disappointed in this movie when I
recently saw it for the first time. I've worked in the Media industry
and I've seen how journalists put the spin on a story. Usually they
start with one small fact and expand it out with conjecture, mixed with
their own personal opinion and some sneaky editing, you've got a
documentary that backs up your own opinion.Even though the said documentary is really only LOOSELY based on facts.This is what he does, he shows some disturbing images, mixed with a
soundtrack that will rip at your heart strings, then he cuts to an
image of a politician (mostly Bush) saying the complete opposite to
what you have seen. Bingo! That person is now a hypocrite.What he doesn't do is take into account the matter to which that person
is referring to at the time. You don't hear the FULL statement, just
the snippet Moore wants you to hear.The movie itself is well made, but please keep an open-mind when
watching this. It only shows ONE side of the story and I always thought
a documentary was meant to show BOTH sides.Please know, I don't hate Michael Moore, he is doing after all what he
does best. Getting his opinion across. I just don't wish people to read
into this movie as fact, and form conclusions, without taking into
account the full debate.I've given it a 1 as I feel as a documentary, it fails completely
because of the point listed above.I hope "Sicko" turns out to be more in the spirit of "Bowling for
Columbine" than this movie.

I love how on February 5, 2007, with the state of the country and the
world being what it is, people can still accuse Michael Moore of over
exaggeration and his emoting of situations surrounding the fallout of
September 11, 2001, in "Fahrenheidt 9/11." Where are we now in the US
of A other than where Moore predicted we would be in his film? Where is
Dubya's approval rating now--like an Oklahoma winter--mid to low 30's?
We all have tons of money in our pocket--right? And, ah, yes, his
recipe for success? SEND MORE TROOPS!! Osama Bin Laden hasn't been
caught, and it's been almost six years. In fact, you won't even hear
his name mentioned unless some archival footage has come out to the
main news media about his disdain for what Dubya is doing now--and you
can count on Fox News will be there to pick it up.Lets face it, I put more faith in the goings on of the world today in
Michael Moore than our current administration. In years to come, if we
are still around to appreciate the omen this film produces, we'll all
look at it with a big "I told you so" blaring right in our faces.

It is disgusting how bias the reviews for this movie are. Anyone who
would allow this movie to set the standard for their political outlook
is either ignorant or completely naive. These are people who probably
still believe that Sherlock Holmes was a real man. Not to show bias for
the truth, but before agreeing with this movie and its message, watch
Farenhype 9/11. It will unravel the truth behind the lies that have
been spoon-fed to you. This is not a movie. This is a documentary. It
has been created with the hopes of brainwashing everyone for the 2004

This has got to be one of the worst examples of documentary film making
I have ever seen. It lacked the imagination of Bowling for Columbine
and instead was a boring spew of America- hating venom and
misinformation. Various news sources such as Newsweek and The New York
Times have pointed out numerous inaccuracies and outright mistruths in
this "documentary," yet it appears that Moore's supporters and certain
individuals on the left do not mind a little fact twisting as long as
they get their viewpoints across.This is propaganda at its ugliest. I just hope that the American public
is not as stupid as Mr. Moore claims it is and will seek out the truth
instead of being swayed by this waste of film.

The summary says it all. I saw this film expecting that I would disagree with some of it, but thought
there would some entertainment anyway. What a disappointing
waste!The difference between a Conservative and a Liberal is that Conservatives
gather facts and THINK about them and the consequences. Liberals FEEL that
their opinions are superior and it feels good to go with the chanting and
the slogans. Except for the leaders of the Liberals, who know what to say to
exploit the masses. A conservative is concerned about what is best for all,
but a liberal is only concerned about his own self interest. I'm guessing
that Hollywood is profoundly liberal because they fear that morality would
cramp their style and reduce their profits.Moore is heavy handed in his propaganda. This film doesn't rise to the level
of a documentary. The only people that are going to be swayed by Moore's
arguments are those that failed to get an education from the public school
system. Anyone that can think will see the inconsistencies between the truth
and this work of fiction.

The documentary used to be an art form unto it's own; a film dedicated to
imparting information, "facts", if you will, to the viewer.  From Jacques
Cousteau telling us about the undersea world to Ken Burns' recent films,
they were informative, often painstakingly researched, and generally, if you
were interested in the stated subject, entertaining. I loved just about
every one of them.Enter Michael Moore. I remember, the first time I saw "Roger & Me", thinking
it was a funny film. A documentary? Of course not, but a comedy made in
documentary style. Surely no one would believe that Roger Smith wantonly and
maliciously single handedly destroyed Flint, Michigan for personal and
corporate gain, right? Little did I know at that point how seriously Mr.
Moore took himself.These days, the documentary is under assault. With television shows like
"Who Wants To Marry My Dad?" and psuedo-documentary films like "Supersize
ME", the form has been diluted. Which brings us to this film. It's title
could have been "George & Me" because nothing has changed. Sure, he can get
better interviews, he has better equipment, he got (eventually) a better
distribution deal but, in the end, it's the same film he's been making for
15 years. And one could laugh about this if it weren't for the fact that,
with the worldwide distribution and all, there's a chance that folks around
the world who aren't familiar with his work (see "Canadian Bacon") might
actually believe it's a compilation of facts! Which might, in this post-9/11
world, encourage some fanatic out there amongst the rabble to actually
believe that our government and, by extension, our security, are that inept,
and encourage them to take their shot.But, I digress. If you are of a liberal bent, see "Fahrenheit 9/11" and lose
yourself for 2 hours in Mr. Moore's fantasy world. If you are of a
conservative nature, see the film anyway, if only to be able rebut, with
authority, it's obvious inaccuracies and omissions. But do the brotherhood
of documentary filmmakers at large a favor; pay to see "Spider-man 2" then
sneak into "Fahrenheit 9/11" instead. Don't encourage this type of film
making by throwing money at it! Oh yes, and Michael? I was tempted to take a
cheap shot at the end of this commentary, but I wouldn't want to encroach on
your turf...

Moore tries to pass off an artwork based on gross misperceptions and
prejudices, as a documentary. Since it is neither factual nor well done, it is neither a documentary, NOR
is it art. It is pig slop. How can he put so much effort into this bad dream? And what is his motive? He pumps it full of obvious lies, and claims it is a documentary.He stirs in plenty of dope and ipacac to make the viewer reel with
brainwashing and nausea.He should put his talents and resources into something that is more
viewable. What demented jerk paid for this anyway?And if he claims it is a documentary, he should make it truthful.He is an immature sleezeball demoralizing his country, just to get

As a conservative I had to see this to get an understanding of what many of
my liberal friends were bashing. It turns out that the whole movie, while
pretty boring, was just over the top propaganda.Moore never defends his views, all of his assertions are speculations and
never considers the other side. One of the points made in the movie was that
a woman's son is sent off to war because he had no choice for college due to
lack of financial aid and parents couldn't afford it. That is fine, but what
about student loans? When someone signs a document that enlists them, they
need to be fully aware of the responsibility that comes with
that.Like most liberals I know, she blames the Republicans for him being killed,
and not the fact he thought the army was a better choice then work programs
and student loans. I also found it humorous at the lack of civility LIBERALS showed the
President when he was inaugurated(sp) by throwing eggs at the car. Bush won
the election, he won Florida. It was recounted an infinite amount of times
and Gore never had it. It's really sad to see that people actually gave this guy funding to produce
such a film. I would have liked to see Moore actually articulate a
counter-point against his views.

This movie sucked it is full of lies and gaping holes in the truth it
is pieced together of multiple speeches and made to seem like it was an
actual event.This type of movie will only galvanize the republican
party but may even convert some democratic liberals into republicans.
To make a great movie Micheal Moore should move to France where he will
fit in with his socialist friends if he filmed this it would surely out
preform titanic at the box office.Note to Linda hope that this recent
curb ending experience will bring you to your senses and if not

$8.50 for my ticket and $12.00 for popcorn and coke after seeing this

The last film (and I'm being VERY kind calling this celluloid toilet paper a
"film") I saw with this much fantasy in it was THE WIZARD OF OZ! This fat
Clown wouldn't know a fact if it bit him on his a**! What studio bought this
trash, much less put it out for the public and who BELIEVES this sh**?!?!
Michael Moore is an idiot!!!! Bowling for Columbine was stupid and
convoluded and just plain WRONG enough, but this drivel is so full of bold
face LIES it's pathetic, and anyone who believes it is not only obviously a
card carrying member of the Democratic Party but a complete FOOL! This
"movie" is quite simply a lie - nothing more or less! Michael Moore is a
Democrat and trying to make bush look bad, but a stupid movie like this
isn't going to do it! C'mon, Fat boy, you gotta do better than
this!

This movie was so incredibly boring. You have to be a moron to learn
anything from this film - all of this stuff is on the news every single
day.Michael Moore is a menace to this country - preferring a nation divided
rather than one united. Facts are manipulated to serve his twisted
purposes - and so obviously. I would give him credit for being a good
propagandist, but he did not even achieve that. The same things he
criticizes the Marines for doing, recruiting by showing only one side
of that life, he does all up and down his film. Not to mention, he is
exploiting our military and the poor people who lost family in this
war. I wish he would move to France and choke on a sandwich. What a fat
piece of crap. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE AND DON'T BUY INTO THIS MOVIE!
Thank you.

Pure trash, but some good chuckles here and there. It does play well to
the ill-informed and ignorant. I wouldn't recommend anyone to pay to
view this film. If you get a chance to view it free it's worth sitting
through. This movie sort of reminded me of that corny movie from the
1930's they used to play at the midnight movies on Friday night I think
it was called Reefer Madness, about the same quality only in color. The
Left will love this movie, the Right will hate it, The normal Americans
will see it for what it is corny propaganda, nothing a sane individual
would base their vote on.

as well as the vote statistics. It's obvious that the voting is split
between those who hate this country, and the rest. With each passing
day, more and more respected liberals are openly criticizing the
factual errors that make up the fabric of this film, and the
credibility of the man who made it. I believe this work will go down as
a poster child for the phrase "politics of personal destruction." What
is most disturbing to me is the absence of national responsibility that
this episode has revealed in many people. The children of the sixties
(which Moore barely qualifies as) have come of age, and are still
children. Isn't it ironic how that supposedly peace-loving youth has
bred some of the most intolerant, evil-minded adults.People, it's alright to embrace an opposing or unpopular point of view.
That's where many great things are born. But it's important to truly
understand your point of view. If you don't question your own beliefs,
your world is built on shaky ground. One last thought...Accentuate the
positive.Stop with all the negativity. At the individual level, we all make
mistakes. But, I for one, would rather learn from them and become a
better person than condemn myself to extinction. Our country is the
same. The Michael Moores of the world would like to see this country
destroyed rather than improved. Not me, I live here. I don't want to
move.

show the Democrat's true colors. He also conveniently leaves out that
the Carlyle group owns part of the company distributing the film which

Micheal Moore is a perfect example of whats wrong with America. And the
worst part Americans are gullible enough to fork out their hard earned
cash to view his distorted diatribe.The man is not even a man or an
American. This movie does not deserve to be in movie houses. I demanded
my money back and got it. Any real American could see in the first five
minutes where this movie is going (nowhere). Michael Moore could do so
much good with his money, but he chooses to try to lead people on his
own personal agenda. There are no facts to back-up anything he
presents, and besides America was a much better place before people
like Michael Moore existed.Don't be one of the fools to waste your
money. Take my advice Watch a real movie like 30 seconds over Tokyo.

Judged by what it is, a propaganda film, the film is quite good: it
hits all the right buttons playing to people's fears and prejudices.
Like all prop messages, "facts" are grossly distorted and twisted to
meet the intent of the film: to incite fear and loathing by means of
grotesque images and thoughts. It's a very calculated and carefully
executed symphony of hate that is intended to play to the worst
instincts of the viewer. This isn't just some version of events that's at odds with received
truth and therefore perhaps worthy of debate on that point; the film
takes truth as a departure point and plunges into an intentionally
perverted retelling of one of the most significant events of modern
times.If you're entertained by this sort of hysterical yammering, I suggest
you recall the old warning from the Sixties: "Too much speed or
politics can rot your brain."

By now, all sophisticated filmgoers understand Moore's recipe. Skillful but
misleading editing, unrepresentative but emotionally powerful images,
narcissistic self-involvement, and a complete disregard for truth or
subtlety. The result, to be sure, can be powerful propaganda. The fact that
so many Americans seem to be taken in by it is evidence that the American
educational system is in bad need of overhaul. Courses in critical thinking
need to be taught in every American high school.Many viewers of this film were apparently struck by Moore's implication that
Bush gave members of the Bin Laden family free passes out of the country
while airplanes were grounded. Gong! Turns out, this was a fabrication. The
planes were not grounded...and the Bin Laden
family members were interviewed before being allowed to
leave.Many viewers apparently believed that members of the Taliban flew
to
Texas to meet with Bush. Except that Moore never said that, he
only
deliberately implied that. Many viewers were impressed by Bush's apparent confusion when first
confronted with the developing facts of 9/11. Of course,
virtually
any person can be made to look stupid, small-minded, confused, mean,
whatever if a camera happens to catch them at the right moment. Jimmy Carter
was paralyzed for more than a year when the mullahs took hostages. I'm sure
that, during that time, there were thousands of minutes when he stared
vacantly into space, wondering what to do next.
So what?Moore has a way of presenting "facts" that lull people into false premises.
For example, in "Bowling for Columbine," he seemed to
"randomly" open a door in a major Canadian city and found it
unlocked.
The message is that there are profound differences between Canadaand the U.S. Of course, anyone who has lived in any major
Canadian
city knows that Canadians lock their doors, and that it is highlylikely Moore staged the event shown in the film. I'm sure Moore will convert some people with this film. That is
what
propagandists do.

The name of the movie should be "Fictionheit 9/11"! This movie is a
complete and total crock and is only in theaters because of one man's
personal obsession with shoving his extreme leftist political agenda
down America's throat, while conveniently lining his own pockets in the
process!Everyone with at least half a brain would've figured out by now that
Michael Moore is the far left's version of (famed Nazi Propaganda
Minister) Joseph Goebbels, and would've either stayed away from this
film entirely or had at least gone into the theater with a checklist of
Moore's outright lies printed out so they could check off each blatant
lie or half-truth as it is encountered in the film). Take particular
note of Moore's claims about the Bush administration supposedly
allowing the Saudis to leave America on airplanes WITHOUT being
interviewed and BEFORE airspace was re-opened in the days immediately
following 9/11. Both claims have already been debunked as being
blatantly FALSE!! Heck, even the title has been ripped off from
well-respected science fiction author, Ray Bradbury, without
permission!!Moore now claims that he'll put extras on his upcoming DVD release
(appropriately timed so that he can attempt to alter the course of the
fall election in HIS direction) including supposed footage of
"interviews" with random people from other nations that tell what they
think of America. Hmm...wonder if these will be FAIR and BALANCED
interviews, as they should, or if ole Mikey will undoubtedly edit out
all the people who's views would happen praise the Bush
administration?? Again, if you have half a brain in your head, you'll
know what to do when (and more appropriately IF) Mikey Moore's creative
fictional propaganda comes to town!!

While there was some great footage in this film, the total lack of
objectivity and balance was extremely annoying. How this can be
considered a documentary when it's so full of one-sided opinions is
beyond me. Where's the balance? Point - Counterpoint? It simply didn't
exist in this political commercial. As a former military person in a different war, I was very offended at
his description of the 'rush' that soldiers get from killing babies.
That whole sequence was disgusting. Michael Moore was on screen much less in this film than his previous
work and that was refreshing, although his voice narrates throughout. It's not surprising that Michael Moore spends his life bashing George
Bush but, come on! Enough is enough. If you're going to bash the
President at least try to make it somewhat factual. This was more
fiction than fact.

Typical Moore movie, uses everything possible to prove his point
whether it is truthful or not. Fahrenheit 9/11 didn't expose anything
that most people didn't already know. The movie is basically a cheap
condensed version of "Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War",
and "Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election." in one movie. I'm
all for getting bush out of office but at least use more credible
sources, and don't take everything out of context. The only thing good
about this move were the little clips of bush making himself look like
a complete and total idiot and that Moore wasn't in the movie as much
as he was in his previous releases (Roger & Me, Bowling for Columbine)

Michael Moore is the Joseph Geobbels of the 21st Century. Before this film
was released, Moore stated it was 100%  true, and he  would sue anybody who
said  otherwise.
So far,  plenty of people have publicly stated a great deal of this film is
no more than Moore's personal opinion. He has not sued anybody, nor  will
he. Moore is  just a lap dog of the Democrat Party, and like typical 
Democrats he  always appeals to people's fears, not their dreams. Moore is among the greatest cheap-shot artists of all time. He will never
permit  the truth to stand between himself and the story he wants to portray
as  the  "truth".
He is a sad example of someone who attempts to portray himself  as an
artist, but is no more than the second coming of Geobbels
himself.

I have just seen this film and it really falls flat. Michael Moore
makes a complete fool of himself. He has made some good movies, but
this is not one of them.He hates President Bush so much that he is willing to lie to America
just to make his point. I'm not saying that it's all lies, but most of
this film is saturated with lies. I don't know how the anti-bush people
can fall for Moore's tricks so easily. It's really laughable. Check the
facts, before you believe Mr. Moore's conspiracy theories.The film is entertaining, but in the worst way possible. It makes more

It is a shameful day for the planet that anyone would watch this junk and
consider it worth their time.  If I lied this blatantly in an alleged
'documentary' film, I'd go to prison.  Why is Moore permitted to continually
produce such garbage?  And who are the mindless cattle that give him awards
for his refuse?  The only thing he didn't do was cut together snippets of OJ
Simpson and Adolph Hitler fingering the President as the one who killed
Princess Diana, shot JFK, and piloted the plane the dropped the first bomb
at Pearl Harbor.  Moore is manufacturing lies in an attempt to swing an
election, to the glee of his pals like Soros, the Nazi expatriate who wants
a President that will subjgate the United States to the will of the UN.  I
grieve for any country that would be swayed this way.  There is only one
reward for mindlessly following Moore and his lies into voting against Bush.
 Terrorists will get a green light from a weak Kerry to spill lakes of
infidel blood on American soil.

This alleged documentary seems to be lacking in the most important

my word, you can get the straight facts from the world news NBC, or you can
just be the stupid sheep that this movie apparently believes you to be. 
This movie has no business in the general theater if it is the 'documentary'
it claims, and it lies, to be.  Maybe mr. moore should instead be on his
knees thanking God, if he believes..which I doubt, that he lives in a
country that allows him to show this tripe in the first place.  Leave this
garbage to the artsy theaters that deal with this, not major movie theater
chains.  Frankly, I thank God everyday for President Bush, to have a
President that believes in God and the good in this nation.  Oh, but thats
not popular...instead the left wing sheep would prefer a president that uses
the white house as his own private house of ill repute, duh.  Why don't you
check the true facts, and not the blatant lies, the positive things that
were deliberately left out, and things taken out of context.  Don't be the

After some of his other great movies I expected much more from Moore on this
one.  It falls short and when Moore is trying to make Bush look like a fool
he only succeeds it doing that to himself.  Moore needs to recall this movie
and deep six it before too many see it and his rep is in the dumper
forever.Besides this movie is so politicized in an election year I'm not sure what
he expected.  He was political driven when he made this movie and it really
shows.  Not sure what he expected from his critics here but maybe he doesn't
care and Moore wants to just put it out there in everyone's
faces.Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  There are too many good movies out
there to see.

I recall the good old days when mr. moore was someone to be taken
seriously, where his political convictions meant something, where he
was after that all so fabled word "the truth", but that was Roger & Me,
and that was 15 years ago. In farenheit, mr. moore takes what
information is already readily available to the public, be it through
general knowledge, government papers, etc... and turns it meet his own
political goals, which seem to be an utter hatred for our current
puppet of a president, mr. bush. Necessary, no, amusing, maybe,
comical, by all means. However, the movie does portray some things that we all as humans
should at least acknowledge, the atrocity of war, the hatred of
peoples, and the undesirable death of innocents; but all this can be
done with a film such as Stalingrad (1993), and not with a piece of
propaganda that utilizes this country's recent wound to prod at and
make you . Not to mention a bit of prisoner sexual abuse footage shot
in Dec, that never made it to the media. Why? Could we not have
prevented the abuse of numerous other POW's? Who knows, but it sure
points to what undoubtedly is mr. moore's end game, the greenback. Anyway, enough of this rant, but I do wonder if mr. moore will make a
film about one John Kerry his ties to the Kennedy's, the Heinz fortune,
his somewhat questionable senate voting record and a little thing
called special interest. Yeah he probably will, being an independent
and all (sarcasm off).

Documentaries: I've made  32 of them, and I'm ashamed of the way Michael
Moore has hijacked the genre. This film is so propagandistic I can only
speak of it in terms of "Triumph of the Will" the well known propaganda film
made by Leni Reifenstahl, Hitler's favorite filmmaker. Moore is so selective
and spins his private take on the tragic events of 9/11 that truth is
carefully obfuscated. Give me the same footage and I can make a totally
different movie. Moore is counting on the infamy of the event and a polarity
in the body politic to insure a big success on a low budget piece of
garbage. What he's doing in fact, is spinning a spider web over nearly 3000
unfortunate souls to advance his political agenda. His title should have
been Fahrenheit 200, the temperature at which film negative burns.
Disgusting. Moore get a life.

I like to give people the benefit of the doubt when I watch their work, just

cinematography sucks, the interviews are broad-siding (a no-no if you're
doing an all-sided documentary), and Mr. Moore does nothing to preclude his
hatred for all things Bush.My only question...can Michael Moore actually write fiction? And if he can,
can he do better than Fahrenheit 9/11 (or even Bowling for
Columbine)?

This is the michael moore that was booed at the Academy Awards and disliked
by most people 2 years ago.  Now the media has attempted to build him up and
he is being cheered at film festivals.  This whole situation reminds me of
when I was teaching as a professor of history.  I was told by 2 seperate
chairpersons that I was using "excellent" communist textbooks but "don't
tell the students that."  I refused to be a puppet of the left wing and have
been blackballed out of the business.This film is similar.  The film going public is not supposed to know that
this film is the product of a socialist.  Although most people know now that
Moore is hopelessly left it may still fool a few.

Exactly as Kylopod describes in his comment, watching this film was
very disappointing because it fails completely to deliver properly
build arguments. It is well made as Bowling for Columbia was, but in
spite of getting better Michael Moore criticism has fallen into an hymn
of auto satisfaction. Every shot of this movies are so biased that
after a while it fails completely to convince the viewer to even listen
to Michael Moor's arguments which might be a little bit true. For
example as he was talking about America's coalition for Irak we see
ridiculous picture which should represent countries and the lack of
support that they bring to the USA, but no mention was made from UK,
Australia, Japan, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Poland... which forces are
definitely more serious than the one show in the movie. Michael Moore
only used to defend his idea the tactics to turn his enemies into
ridiculousness rather than trying to find any good arguments. All in
all if what we see is right, we can conclude that Bush has no brain,
his administration is only thinking about selfish interest (how about
Moore.. do all the money he made from his pictures and books go to
charities or poor Iraky kids?),Irak was the best country in the world
far from the corrupted world of USA, Marroco do only have monkeys,
Roumania still lives in Middle Age, Holland people are retarded hippies
who spend their time smoking pot, every person with a turban is a
terrorist, and that if a person of your family is a criminal we should
imprison all the family.

Farhenheit 9/11 is a good film for those of you who dislike George W.
Bush. Personally, i'm not a huge fan of his accomplishments, but
Michael Moore is one of the worst documentary directors. He's excellent
at persuading, by leaving out the other side, but as for his
credibility? He has none. Michael Moore makes some very valid points in
this film, but he says NOTHING to support the other spectrum, nor does
he even acknowledge it. The only TRUE evidence that Michael Moore gave
to you is a grieving mother, longing for her dead son. It's worth
watching/renting. In my opinion, the war wasn't justified, but before
you make a final verdict on whether to scorn or praise George
Bush...see another movie.

Whatever pushed the notorious self promoter Michael Moore to
drastically reduce his screen time (in comparison to his other films)
in Fahrenheit 911, it was a wise choice. As far as I'm concerned he
could/should have reduced that screen time even further, but in spite
of the weaker sections of the film (where he plays an interviewer who
makes his interviewee points for them and feeds his subjects their
lines) this is still a brilliant and powerful film. Even some of the
questionable paths Moore follows are thought provoking, though not
necessarily in the way he might have intended.The most powerful areas in the film for me are the talking heads from
various area's of government who, without being pushed, matter of
factly state some observations that we rarely if ever heard on national
TV networks during the build up and first year of the Iraq invasion.
Most of these points made have become more and more obvious by events
in the world as time has gone by, and will likely help this film garner
positive recognition for years in spite of it's potential to be a
quickly dated documentary. The Lipscomb section of the film was generally well handled and might
have the biggest impact on non-partisan viewers. Especially powerful
here was the confrontation before the blinders-wearing woman accusing
Lipscomb of making up the story about her killed son in the military in
order to make a political message (though of course, she could have
accused Moore of this). That bit of film will be a slap in the face for Moore haters who refuse
to consider that they may have been duped in the race to war by their
leaders under the guise of being protected from terrorism.This film is flawed but still an important work, and likely a relief
for much of the world that worries the USA is sliding towards becoming
a dangerous rogue nation behind extremist Neocon pied pipers.

<<Some Spoilers>>First off, the title of this film irritates me. It is a rip-off of the
excellent Ray Bradbury book/script 'Fahrenheit 451'. Obviously, both
films are fiction, but the Bradbury film is well written and has
substance. Fahrenheit 911 is entertaining and not much more  with way
too much Moore.I am not associated with any political party, and in the current
political environment, I am inclined to vote 'E  None of the Above'.
Thus, I am fairly objective. I watched this movie with an objective
mind. Early in this film, my mind objected. To say it has a hidden
agenda is a gross misrepresentation. The agenda is most assuredly, not
hidden. It is subtle as a hand grenade. The timing of the release
clearly reveals its political agenda to cast aspersions at the
President. This is a valid tactic, since you can't say much positive
about either candidate. Where is Alfred E. Newman or Pat Paulsen when
we really need them?'Fahrenheit 911' presents a series of 'facts' about George W Bush from
the 2000 election, 9/11 attacks and the subsequent invasion of Iraq.
All the valid facts could be presented in 5 minutes, however, there is
the political message to sway the ignorant and uninformed, i.e., the
typical Moore aficionado. F-911 depicts the administration as sinister
and corrupt. It promotes the assertion the Bush Administration lied
about the WMD. I don't know if they had WMD, or not; but, anyone with
an IQ over room temperature would realize the WMDs went to Syria when
CNN announced the invasion. Personally, I do not support the Iraq war.
It seems like a bad flashback of Viet Nam. I am not a fan of Mike Moore. Give him a disaster and a camera and he
is all set to rake in the bucks. Flint, MI is having hard times and
Mike is there  camera in hand and cash in pocket. Kids get killed by
wackos in Colorado and Mike makes money, er, a movie. The terrorist
jerks kill a bunch of civilians on 9/11 and Mike makes his contribution
to his bank account. Yet, no one questions HIS motives! This film may be characterized as Liberal propaganda. This statement is
not derogatory. Propaganda has a sinister overtone in America, but
propaganda is just presenting a point of view without presenting a
dissenting point of view. However, portraying this film as a
'documentary' is a blatant misuse of the word. A documentary is based
on facts, not innuendo. Mike raises questions and makes unsupported
assertions, but he does not present supporting facts. Hence, the film
is not a documentary. My belief is that 'Fahrenheit 911' is a just a political vehicle. It
appears that most people either proclaim it as an epiphany or denounce
it. I found it entertaining, but I wouldn't want to have the
unenlightened use it as a historical document. It is simplistic and
strongly biased. Many processes and systems failed us on 9/11. Didn't
we learn anything from the first and largely forgotten attempt on the
WTC? Willie Clinton was President at that time, and he wasn't taken to
task in this film.I guess MM is posturing for a cabinet post in the Democratic
Administration.. Secy of BS, perhaps?2/10

This is NOT a documentary. It is an OP-ED piece made by an idiot. It
depicts Moore's very biased look at Bush administration and the war on
terrorism. It's clever and funny (in a dark way) but it's not just
"documenting" its subject matter. Although I happen to agree with SOME of Moore's points of view, too
many things are kluged or deliberately distorted to prove his points.
Newsweek and other generally reliable mainstream news outlets have
questioned the veracity of several key points of the content in this
film. In the end, Moore undermines his own credibility and the validity of
any point of view he might hold. Nevertheless, all that has not stopped
Moore from getting disgustingly fat and very rich on an amusingly
bundled package of half-truths and some outright lies.

I have found Moore's previous films to be largely entertaining, particularly
Bowling for Columbine, but was surprised (given the high acclaim) to end up
virtually twiddling my thumbs, debating whether to just bolt towards the end
of the movie.  It started out well enough, but for me it trailed off
substantially.  I would have cut a good 20 minutes out of the
film.I will not be voting for Bush (just to let you know something about my
politics).  Watching BFC, I became interested (that's a good thing, right?)
in looking up some gun-related topics and was surprised to learn that Moore
was a bit disingenuous with some of his material.  So before watching F911,
I labored thru all of the "56 deceits" page available on the internet.  It
was informative to watch the film knowing what things were left out and the
complete story behind some of the scenes.Now, I will be the first to praise Moore for raising some valuable issues,
and I would also let you know that many of these "deceits" are subjective or
immaterial, but the bottom line is that there were a number of disturbing
disconnects from reality in the movie.  In all fairness, no one that I have
seen on any side of politics has written a 100% truthful book, for example,
generally because research of that depth and breadth is hard to come by, but
Moore's intellectual dishonesty in some of this film is to me
inexcusable.I tried to think of it as just "entertainment,"  kind of a Daily Show via
film, but in this case for me the entertainment was surprisingly lacking,
and I find it disturbing that many will look on this as a documentary, as
the gospel truth.  I have to assume that the universal praise for this film
has a lot more to do with belief systems than with film-making.

In my opinion the movie is not a very good piece of work. It lacks a
lot of objectivity which pretty much just makes it stand out as a
propaganda movie. All I saw in the movie was a loud cry to the US
saying "Do NOT reelect the warmaniac bush, he'll kill all your
children". I do not see myself as a pro-war person, maybe not even
pro-bush, but this is what the movie looked like to me. In my opinion
the movie was created to mess with peoples minds and reminded me a lot
of Soviet propaganda. If you have not yet seen the movie I cannot
advise you to, but still, if you choose to anyway all I can say is:
Make sure you know where to vote before you watch it, and guard
yourself from what you see. Yeay God and bless ya all.

No doubt about it. He is the Leni Reifenstahl(Hitlers film-maker) of our
generation. He is using his filmaking talent(if you want to call it that) to
promote a left-wing socialist political agenda. Most of his film is full of
holes and only partial truths. Like only using the few negative comments
culled from thousands of soldiers who actually SUPPORT the war effort! Or
the way he paints a phony picture of tranquility in Iraq before the bombs
start dropping! Nonsense!
Moore is a dangerous breed, but I personally think most INTELLIGENT
AMERICANS see him for the buffoon he is. Maybe Hollywood likes him, what
with them mostly being ivory tower rich types(Barbra Streisand..ect) who say
they are for the little guy but find no guilt in taking 25M paydays or
charging 2000$ for a concert ticket! What hypocrisy!
But in the end, this movie may actually BACKFIRE on the Democrats effort to
seize power. Americans by and large aren't stupid. Yea, many of the dolts
who get welfare and other public benefits will vote democrat because they
are promised that by liberals in return for votes, but the rest of us see
the LIES and know Kerry is a dangerous man if elected to the presidency. Our
biggest fears won't be Bush for another 4 years, but terrorist having their
way in a weakened America!
God have mercy on us if Moore gets his way!
911 sucks!~

I think making a movie based on such false accusations is immature and
very unprofessional, this is just another strategical method for John
Kerry to get in office. The people that made this movie should be
ashamed of themselves for such obscenity. They have ridiculed,
falsified, and mocked the very president of the United States, and
their own country. The very man who responded to such an act as 9/11 in
the only way a president could. If John Kerry had been in office during
9/11 and not acted on such an occasion the same way, he would have been
a traitor to us all. Such films do not move my vote and they shouldn't
move the rest of the public either. I only hope the public will see
this movie with its real face (just another campaign method) and not
for the falsified information that it is.

This film caters to sniveling little fools who will believe anything.  It is
a film that dwells on the darkest pessimism of people.  Michael Moore is
nothing more than an arm of the democratic (socialist) party. This film will make happy those extreme liberals happy.  People who will
like this are those types like white computor nerd liberal men who hate
themselves and cackle at things like south park and watch baseball and rave
about things like the race of the pitcher.  These type of men are churned
out from colleges now by the millions.  Or the newly created image of black
males as arrogant, loud mouthes and crude that come from rap videos and are
now considered acceptable types but they are unbearable.  Or militant
feminist girls who have been taught from childhood that girls don't smile
and are never sweet and they should be mean and aggressive, self serving
defensive people.  These girls are so brainwashed they do not know who they
are.It is an awful lie filled film.  We have reached total bottom of the barrel
with this film.

One of the great things about democracy--not that democracy is all that
great (just read Plato)--is that even leftists, liberals, and Mike
Moore can be wrong. The working class schmuck from wherever the devil
he is from will get his comeuppance. Beneath the smirk and the idiot
baseball cap or the Armani suits lurks an angry, vicious ideologue who
is a few months away from serious depression when his cotton candy
world disappears. The New York Times--saints preserve us--is reporting
that should Kerry become President, Mike Moore is a shoe-in for
ambassador to Iraq. Should President Bush be re-elected it has been
rumored that France is considering extraditing Moore.

Documentaries by definition are objective. Michael Moore's recent films
give no indication of his even *trying* to be objective. His agenda is
well-known (ever since he was booed off the stage at the Oscars in
2003), and this boorish propaganda, while thought-provoking to this
political moderate who has no vested interest in either political
party, is an insult to anyone with a brain who wants to think for
themselves.Like "Roger & Me" and "Bowling for Columbine", Moore takes a lot of
liberties with the truth in order to make his repetitive point(s).
Creative editing, lack of contextualization and blatant
misrepresentations litter this film. Again, it's thought-provoking, and
that is never a bad thing. But the delivery under the pretense of
objectivity is laughable, and the fact this film is even qualified as a
documentary is ridiculous.Moore has basically become the Rush Limbaugh of the Left (yes, he's a
big fat idiot). Why people give him a platform is beyond me; I agree
with many of Moore's social opinions, yet I vehemently disagree with
his tactics. They are akin to teaching racism to the next generation of
America; preaching hate and anger isn't a good idea, especially when
you're doing it dishonestly. Shame on you, Michael Moore, for you're
just as vile and reprehensible as those you choose to "expose" with
your "documentary". Just because you may stand on a higher moral ground
doesn't excuse your intellectual slum job in this film.

I found this movie to be extremely thought provoking. Whether or not
Michael Moore is biased .. his point is that war should only be an done
when absolutely necessary. I can't agree more. What seems strange to me
is that the USA have not learnt from their mistakes in Vietnam. I am a
victim of the Vietnam War ... an orphan who has been adopted to a
family in white society where the prevailing notion is that "we in the
west have a superior way of life and have justified/religious notions
for inflicting suffering on innocent people because of a greater and
glorified end result"! What makes the war in Iraq worse is that is was
unprovoked and that the US thinks it is superior to the UN and the
notions it stands for. How could the world stand by watching and
allowing the US to bypass an organisation setup to prevent the
recurrence of historical events that called it into being?! What kind
of super power are we allowing to dominate the world? Who is standing
up to this and questioning whether it should be allowed? I say bravo
Michael Moore for thinking outside the square and being brave enough to
have personal attacks launched at you because you can see that
something is very wrong here.I also question why some of our Australians are dying and fighting in a
country we have no right or need to be involved in. I can imagine
within 10 or more years .. the world will be saying that the US made
the same mistake they made in Vietnam - that they had no right to
invade! Where are the weapons of mass destruction? We were all duped as
it was a means to an end for Bush! How does he sleep at night? I'm glad
we have a democracy that allows films like Michael Moore's to exist.
Someone has to speak up because like he points out, most Americans are
being brain washed by their media who only give out the messages the
Government and those in power wish to portray.Michael Moore's films are refreshing and thought provoking .. they
question us to not be like sheep .. blindly led .. but to think for
ourselves. Is Moore correct .. is war necessary in Iraq .. is Bush a
crazed idiot seeking to lead a nation on his own agenda .. similar to
the power Hitler had over the German nation? One has to question these
things otherwise we are at risk of losing our integrity, our souls, and
our beliefs & values.Michael Moore is a thought provoking writer/producer who reminds me of
another deep thinker - John Pilger.

Not a documentary, just stabs at President Bush and his administration.
I usually like Moore's stuff, but if he is not going to be objective,
his work just turns into political propaganda. Nice to know these
things are going on in the Presidents Administration, but the other
side is not represented at all (if not as a joke)- I'm sure if the film
wasn't as slanted as it was, I would have enjoyed it.Moore is just riding on spectacle, using one of the Nation's horrific
events to listen to his babbling self. I see the benefits of making a
'movie' out of everything because it will be able to touch a lot of
people, but if people are not given the right facts entertainment must
not be the proper way to feed people clips and half truths. Moore is
manipulating the power of entertainment to get people involved in
politics (GOOD), but not in the way that people 'should' be getting
involved. Now, everything is a joke or must be portrayed in the way
that Moore puts it- making people want to tune in. But at what cost??
What will it take for people to tune in later? an even bigger
spectacle. Farenheit 9/11 is worth seeing, but please don't praise it
for its documentary aspects, because it has none- just propaganda in a
different package.

Michael Moore simply cannot help himself. He truly does hate America's
military, the Republican Party, the Bush administration, and more
specifically, President Bush. He may not be the only person who does,
but Moore goes a bit further by producing a movie about his personal
demons (listed previously). The film is rife with misleading clips and incomplete interviews that
are edited (quite well I must say) that extract only the items of
Moores paradigm of anti-conservatism or anti-military. Mr. Moore
attempts to associate President Bush with the Saud royal family,
basically indicting the President of invoking a war for personal
financial gain. He also makes ludicrous claims that George W. Bush
secreted away Osama bin Laden's family from the U.S. prior to military
action. Further claims that the invasion of Afghanistan was to build an
oil pipeline. Every one of these, as well as virtually every other
claim in the film, have been debunked. Without going into the debate of
why the war was started, suffice it to say that Michael Moore is simply
putting his hatred onto cellulose for the liberal world to revel in.As for the technical side, the film is sketchy, poorly segued, and
oft-times painfully edited by trying to drive home the point that
America is fighting a contrived war (Moore's assertion). Moore has some
skills as a director but unfortunately his political punditry is going
to be his trademark and he has become the media darling. Primarily
because he is tickling the ears of the left.Overall the film is not even worth seeing. Where does one go for a
refund?

Call it propaganda if you wish; it's still good. Now that the 2004
election is over, it's history instead of politics. Fifty years from
now it will be the primary image that people will have of the
administration of 'Dubya', and it won't be a flattering picture.The true test of a documentary film is that one can learn something
from it without falling asleep. This is a keeper. We see Dubya as a
glory-seeking chickenhawk more intent on enriching his cronies than on
seeking to act in accordance with reality. We see his war as his glory,
and others' tragedy, whether of Iraqi civilians or Americans killed or
wounded in action. We see Dubya's war as a rich man's war and a poor
man's fight. We see that the military recruiters can find plenty of
cannon fodder from the places like Flint, ravaged by industrial ruin
(fitting allusion to "Roger & Me"), but few from the still well-off
suburbs. We see the depersonalization of the enemy as a tank crew takes delight
in an obscenity-laced rap song "Die, m-----f-----" while firing at the
enemy. We heard of little of this during the first Gulf War, waged
honorably under the elder Bush.We see the clever methods of media manipulation of the '43'
administration -- Bush and Cheney contradicting each other on the sort
of responses that Americans should have toward terrorism. "Be brave",
says Bush; "be scared", says Cheney. Confusion makes people scared to
oppose those who supposedly know better than we do. I chose to not watch this film until after the 2004 elections. I had
seen smears that it is all propaganda, full of lies, unpatriotic, and
disrespectful of our brave soldiers. The real disrespect goes to those
who least deserve respect -- the Bush administration.

I just saw it, and if I didn't know that there was an equally fierce OTHER
side to his story, I would hate Bush, the American soldiers in Irag, and the
USA. Moore is so brilliant in his creation of propaganda, that his film may
rival in strength the Frank Capra film series from WWII, WHY WE FIGHT, which
has been credited as one of the reasons the Allies won the war. Moore in his
hatred of Bush and corporate America may have in his exuberance done more
harm to the USA than Bin Laden. I am not surprised that Hezbollah is
distributing the film all over the Muslim world. Moore may cause Bush to
lose the election, the US to lose the war in Iraq, the world to lose the war
on terror, the Middle East to lose its pro-western governments, and the USA
to lose  its prestige around the world. It is a propaganda bombshell. It's a
good thing he wasn't around in WWII. One might call his work a "labor of
love." In this case, though, it's pure hatred. It is not hard to realize why
40% of children in Canada think America is evil. Remember what Pogo said
during the Vietnam War? "We have met the enemy, and they are us." Different
war, different meaning.PS: I'm still not voting for Bush. Free speech and The Howard Stern Show are
equally important, and THAT'S a fact.

ANYONE who calls this a documentary, needs to open a dictionary:
documentary- Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or
inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film. This is clearly a
Propaganda film: propaganda Information that is spread for the
purpose of promoting some cause. (In this case, 'Ditch Bush')Moore has done nothing but dredged the sewers of crackpot mania to
regurgitate conspiracy theorists views that have been flowing around
the hate filled corridors of liberal talk shows and 'news' outlets.
Sprinkle that with the pain of those who either have lost love ones on
9/11 or in Iraq, and you are looking at this film. He leaves out and
glides over quickly, facts like Richard Clark okayed the Bin Laden
flyout. In true hick fashion, he has condemned the entire Bin Laden
family, as if you a Hatfield and they are the McCoys. Truly this film
is looking at 9/11 and Iraq in a vacuum, what you aren't told is the
vacuum is located between Moore's ears. Evidence that has clearly been
proven is AWOL, replaced by Moore's interviews with Bush haters. Hate
isn't a platform, and with supporters like MoveOn.org, who know NOTHING
about moving on, he isn't out to show America and the rest of the world
what actually happened, instead telling them what they wanted to hear. Riddle me this Batman, how much of this money is going out to the
victims of the events of 9/11 and the children and spouses of soldiers
who gave their lives so that HE could profit off them?! Ironic, isn't
it, a filmmaker makes LOADS of money by making a film accusing others
of trying to make money off the pains of othersI guess ironic isn't
fitting, HYPOCRITE is.For those wack jobs that say, 'you didn't EVEN see the film' Yes, I
saw it I bought a ticket to the show 'The Terminal' and went and saw
this garbage. My money will never be the blood money of Michael
Mooron's riches!

Moore is bloated on his sense of self importance and though many of his
points have validity, he drags the movie out through many boring and
redundant scenes. In this film he does not do any amusing stunts, and many of his facts
are off base/twisted for his own agenda... Taking this movie literally
is like accepting statistics without knowing who made them and how they
were created.This movie has it's moments, but lacks the charm that Bowling For
Columbine had. Moore instead opts to beat his audience into submission
with his clearly bias viewpoint...Not a great movie, not a great documentary.

Michael Moore is a lying idiot who just wanted to make millions of
dollars on an anti American movie. He has admitted to using false
information in his documentaries and try to find to source for some of
the facts in this crud-filled documentary. if you like this movie so
much, move to another country, doesn't matter which one just go. I know
I won't miss you.And one more thing, Bush is a great president and if
you want to argue, send me a private message. Kerry would make a
half-baked president with nothing to back it up. Gore would have been
no better, probably worse, they are both liars with a "make everybody
happy as long as i win policy. I have had to replace many of those
words with nice ones so use your imagination. My grade on this movie is
an F, -100/100

::Possible Spoilers::  (Is that possible for a "documentary"?)Most things I have seen for and against this movie tell why the movie is
good or bad based on its political message.  Therefore, I will explain why
this movie is awful while trying not to discuss politics. First of all, do not go into this movie expecting a documentary, notice how
a put documentary in quotations earlier.  This movie is indeed little more
than Michael Moore explaining why he hates George W. Bush for 2 hours which
may or may not appeal to you based on your beliefs.  However, this brings up
my first point. This movie is two hours long, which is at least 30 minutes
longer than it needed to be. The material in the movie is spread much too
thin for this to be an interesting movie for 2 hours.  By the end of the
movie I found myself looking at my watch more than the movie to see when it
would end. Unfortunately I did not know how long the movie lasted so I just
looked at my watch.  At the start of the movie Moore draws conclusions and
presents facts that are at least interesting to watch and think about
involving Bush and the Saudis.  Also, the high point of the movie is Michael
Moore riding in an ice cream truck reading the Patriot Act to congress. The movie could have been alright had it not lost focus after the whole Bush
and the Saudis bit.  After that the movie loses focus and is uninteresting. 
The last part of the movie is Michael Moore talking to this woman whose son
died in Iraq.  Except there really isn't much talking she just cries
uncontrollably for half an hour and bemoans her terrible situation which she
seems to think she is the only person to have only endured.  Well guess
what?  At least 1000 other parents have suffered the same thing this war so
shut the $&^%*&% up!!!!!!!!!!!!!Then after you think she is finally gone for good, she shows up in
Washington and starts crying on Pennsylvania Ave. looking at the White
House.  This whole 30-45 minute ordeal is by far one of the most boring
segments I have ever seen.  Do yourself a favor and leave the movie after
Moore quits talking about the Saudis.  The Iraq war segment offers no
substance at all.Rating: Only considering the first hour of the movie, it is thought
provoking, interesting and should keep people that hate Moore intrigued. 
However, the second hour of the movie is terrible. No other way to put
it.D+

I don't care how well made a movie is. (Not that this was particularly
well made) When it is filled with lies and misrepresentations, it can
not be viewed as a good movie. Almost every little detail in Moore's
movie has been proved false, so why anyone would believe any of the
garbage that this anti-American flings is beyond me. The fact that
people listen to someone who has said such vile things about Americans
amazes me. Even someone who does not like the President should be
repulsed by someone who lies and messes with footage to try to prove
his points. And his biggest problem is that he genuinely seems to want
America to fail. Shame on YOU, Mr. Moore, you anti-American, terrorist
sympathizing liar.

Michael Moore is once again hanging himself with this film. I say film
because to call it a documentary is the largest lie of this film filled
with deceit - it is propaganda. As usual, Moore takes some great points
and buries them in his web of half-truths and outright lies. The point
about all the members of Congress having only one child serving in Iraq
is brilliant. It speaks to the big problem of the war and the class
distinction of having the poor fight a war for the rich man's oil. But
this important message is lost among lies about the 2000 election,
mistruths about the timing of dealings with the Saudis, deceit about
the desires of Iraqi citizens, US troops in Iraq and families at home.
If Moore would stick to the facts he would make an ironclad
'documentary' about real problems, instead he makes a mad rant-filled
piece that serves only to further divide the positions.

I really liked "Bowling for Columbine," but this film starts out badly
and just gets worse with the unfounded logic of Moore's emotionalism.
For example, before the title even comes up, he asserts that the claim
by Bush's cousin at Fox News that Bush won the presidency caused the
other networks to automatically change their calling of the election
for Gore (why would that happen? it makes no sense...), and then
asserts that this somehow cemented the election for Bush (how could
that possibly happen?). It goes on down hill from there...Whereas some of Moore's films really poignantly detail the matter that
he is working with, this flops because it is basically a film about
blaming and accusing George Bush for everything and going beyond the
boundaries of logic to do it. I am not a big fan of Bush, but Moore's
claims just took me right out of the film. I am sure that if you hate
George Bush like so many do you will love the film, but if you are
independently minded (and surely if for some reason you actually like
Bush) you will not appreciate the film.

Documentaries are supposed to be factual and this film has some clear
problems. Before you buy into Mr. Moore's agenda, do yourself a favor
and read some educated dissections of this project (there are many by
liberals that pick it apart). It is full of contradictions and
misleading spin. Deninately a disgrace to the documentary genre. One simple example is how Mr. Moore complains about how we did not send
enough troops into Afghanistan, yet he is found later following Marine
recruiters as they prey on the poor, less fortunate young men of Flint,
Michigan by attempting to get them to enlist. Seems like a bit of a
contradiction to me.

I'm a Bush-basher with the best of them, and I was looking forward to
watching a movie about Bush's horrible decision-making and leadership.
Lord knows Moore had enough material to work with. What I saw was a
movie that did every thing it could to make Bush bad, including using
misleading presentations and outright lies. I watched 15 minutes of
this movie before taking it out. What I saw in the first 15 minutes was
this: 1. It was said the Republicans lost control of the Senate early
in Bush's term. This is not true. The party went from a 51-49 majority
to a 50-49-1 majority, with the tiebreaking vote being the Republican
Vice-President. 2. It said that Fox News stated on Election Night that
Bush won Florida because he had a relative working at the station. What
he fails to mention is that regardless of the relationship, Fox was
right, or at least as much right as the other stations initially
stating that Gore won. The race was too close to call at the time, and
Fox was no more wrong than the other stations. 3. He said the reason
Florida went with Bush is because of Katherine Harris is a Republican.
He fails to mention she was overruled by the Democratic State Supreme
Court, which was then overruled by the Federal Supreme Court, which, by
all counts, can be considered split by party. Regardless, Katherine
Harris is not where the buck stopped on this one. 4. He said the reason
no protest of the election could be done in Congress is because no
senator had the guts to sign a protest. The reason no senator signed a
protest is because Bush had won every single recount the state of
Florida did, and therefore, had no reason to sign a protest. Remember,
Gore himself conceded the election. 5. He uses an innuendo to question
the reason Bush blacked out another person's name from Bush's military
record because of the person's questionable history. As all military
records are confidential, and were only being released by Bush because
he is a public figure, he had no right to release papers that showed
the name of another person being reprimanded, and therefore, blacking
out the name was required. These are the ones that I can remember of
the top of my head in only the first 15 minutes of the movie. I should
make a documentary on how to make a documentary. Moore needs to go
watch "Hoop Dreams" to see how a documentary should be made. All that
subject matter and he blows it. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that
some people voted for Bush in 2004 BECAUSE of this movie.

First off I am an independent. So anyone who comes here to bash this
review realize that before you speak about how much I love Bush and
hate Moore. This movie was absolutely terrible. I can't believe that
people were actually talking about how brilliant this film was and how
it could change the outcome of the 2004 election. It even won the top
award at Cannes Film Festival. I find it incredibly hard to find a
single statement in this film that isn't false or makes a valid point.
Moore loosely links Bush to the Saudi Oil family through past business
deals when Bush was in the oil business. He tries to act like the Saudi
family is in control of the US government because Saudi Arabia owns
shares of US stock. Even though Japan, France, England, and many other
countries invest more in the Dow and Nasdaq. Moore seems to incinuate
that the the Saudi's were responsible for the attack, even when Al
Qaeda claimed responsibility. A lot of scenes in this movie are from
stock footage that is meant for shock value. The end with the woman
walking up to the steps of the White House is staged. If you listen you
can actually hear a woman who walks by say "This is all staged" right
before a conversion with a protester and the old woman who lost her son
in Iraq. Moore's attempt to get ahead at the opposition to the war and
Bush. Not even worth downloading a copy on the internet for free. A
complete waste of 2 hours 1 out of 10

At least in Bowling for Columbine and Roger & Me the fat man made some
effort to lie cleverly, and provide some entertainment. There are
plenty of true complaints and real criticisms he could have focused on
here. Instead he chose not to bother with trivial things, like the
truth and facts and lazily opted to instead cater to those who are
willing to believe without question whatever he shows them.Shameless exploitation of the tragic events of 9/11 and the families of
the veterans he purposely misrepresented with his infamous creative
splicing of clips to create from real people the characters and events
he wants to portray. Real people, who have since been trying
desperately to condemn this mockumentary and fight the giant (both in
power and girth) who has used them to express a point of view they do
not share.I actually enjoyed Bowling for Columbine, and Roger & Me, even while
disagreeing with the majority of what both films expressed. After this
though I feel nothing but disgust and absolute disdain for Michael
Moore, who has needlessly caused further suffering to people who have
most certainly been through enough. I'm sure, if he had taken the time
he could have found more family members of veterans who actually agreed
with his point of view, but he instead chose to hack and splice his
opinions and express them through those who do not, thereby victimizing
them further.Luckily, I saw a news program with just a few of these people and after
hearing what they had to say I didn't purchase a ticket, or rent this
movie. I saw it on a free HBO preview event. If you must see it, I
would suggest you see it for free like I did. No matter what your
political positions are, there is just no justifying what he did to
those people for the sake of making a few bucks to stuff into his
already fat wallet. I for one won't be contributing to his fortune.

Michael Moore has again demonstrated he is a left wing, America hating,
Bush hating, lying, distorting, buffoon. Given his ability to lie with
a straight face and grossly distort anything/everything President Bush
says or does, he would make Joseph Goebbels, one of history's greatest
liars, blush. Moore probably should have stopped after his
"documentary" on big business. At that time, he was at least somewhat
funny. Now he demonstrates forcefully that, given his hate for anything
American and allowing this attitude to form grossly distorted opinion,
he is merely irrelevant. For anyone believing this buffoon, I would
like to sell you some beach front property in Arizona. Moore's job is
easy, requiring little or no talent. Take unflattering pictures of Bush
and his cabinet or friends, then overlay this with lies and distortions
passing off as legitimate commentary.

If part of enjoying a movie involves the story and the story is factually
incorrect, it often takes away from my experience. This is the case with
Fahrenheit 9/11. The story is so blatantly one-sided and unfair that I
couldn't help wanting to give a giant rolleyes in every scene. How am I
supposed to take a film seriously when its entire premise is
dishonest?As you know, Fahrenheit 9/11 makes some very serious accusations against the
United States government. True, it may be, that our government is faulted.
But in this film's story, everything under our present government is faulted
- nothing is clean!How ridiculous.Most of Moore's accusations range from the serious to the absurd. Take them
with a grain of salt. (I would accept the charges Moore makes if there
weren't other numerous, merited possibilities for each scenario). After each
accusation is made, we see "the proof in the pudding." Moore strings
together an unrelated sound bite, a jazzy sound track and a condescending
narrative piece to prove to the audience he's right. To me, it's very
transparent."Emotion is cheap" would be Michael Moore's mantra to film making. Many of
his segments involve somebody who was hurt by our present government. He
shows us their pain by filming them - they're crying and they look
depressed. And why? Because George W. Bush is evil. This is the level of
sophistication that Moore bases his movie. What a silly, silly
man.Moore has disappointed me yet again. He has so much potential to put
together a quality piece of film! He knows when to use the right music to
support his statements, he understands the power of editing (but abuses it),
and he knows how to make a controversial movie. For his next piece, I only
suggest that he's fair, balanced and writes an honest story.Voted the lowest rating possible.

I've just revised my vote for F9/11 from a 7 to a 5, after reading the book
"Fraud - The Strategy Behind The Bush Lies...".  My initial impression of
the film was that it was a deeply flawed piece of journalism that used
innuendo, insinuation and emotional appeals much too heavily, but it was
still an important film and deserved credit for getting the issues into the
public arena, given the failure of the mainstream US media to do so.  I gave
the film the benefit of the doubt for its failure to provide solid arguments
and evidence because I figured it was probably hard to find evidence of
deception by powerful people with huge resources available to cover them
up.Reading FRAUD has revealed to me that it is *not* hard at all - there is a
wealth of evidence that the author seems to have assembled mainly from
searching media archives and databases.  Rather than insinuation and
conjecture, the book presents page after page of solid facts and figures
that demonstrate the breadth and depth of the Bush administration's
deceptions on practically every aspect of their goverment, all from
accredited sources (often government sources or right wing sources
themselves).  I thought that F9/11 was a good start that didn't really aim
wide or high enough in its targets, and FRAUD has confirmed this more than I
could have imagined.I'm sure conservatives out there will dismiss the book as "liberal lies and
propaganda", but much or most of the information there is quoted from
sources that are clearly not "liberal institutions".  The author also
provides insightful analysis into the workings of republican organisations
that manage to promote and maintain the deceptions of the Republican party,
and convince ordinary Americans that they're the ones defending their rights
and any information to the contrary is part of some absurd "liberal
conspiracy".So, unlike many other reviewers here that will urge you not to see
Fahrenheit 9/11 because it's all "lies and propaganda", I say go see it if
you like but make sure you follow it up with further/deeper research,
because the film barely scratches the surface.The more independent research I do (and I read both liberal and conservative
sources), the more horrified I am by the state of American politics and
society today.

So many have bashed Michael Moore and his films without ever having
seen them. This is one that they should see. The film is put together
extremely well and unearths many questions surrounding September 11th
that still are unanswered today.The connection between the United States and Saudi Arabia is disturbing
and well documented in the film. Both parties have fallen into
friendship with a country that should not be at the top of our friends
list.Regardless of your political ilk, this is a film you should see and
discuss.

I've looked forward to every Michael Moore movie since Roger & Me. This
was not his best. This drivel was mainly a political ad for the current
Democrats running for President. Don't get me wrong I am definitely not
a Bush supporter. The hype with which Moore used the media to attack
Disney for not releasing this movie was sickening. It makes me laugh
everytime the media gets used for someone's own agenda. The only reason
for it was to get people to go see the movie. Especially when he was
callously screaming about the Republicans keeping him from showing the
"Truth". Please - I do tireless research for my job & find the current
issues & learn about the candidates & their opponents. Believe me 95%
of this movie is crap, pure crap. Michael you can do so much better.
Please get over this hate fest you currently have for this
administration. Get Over It!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's bewildering why those who praise Moore's film as if they were lap
dogs licking at their master's face continue to get away with calling
it a DOCUMENTARY when it, and the equally farcical and agenda-driven
"Bowling for Columbine" most assuredly are NOT documentaries. Moore's
rampant misrepresentations and editing of the information and the
footage are worthy of the spinmeisters of the Third Reich, or of
Stalinist Russia, not of any documentary tradition that I ever studied
in school. One word describes this work - PROPAGANDA. What's worse is
that Moore passes himself off as just a working stiff, a blue collar
guy, while retaining legions of lawyers to protect himself from those
who challenge his distortions, and all the while he's overseas telling
European audiences what dunces his countrymen are. Michael Moore is a
fat stupid white man, to paraphrase one of his titles, and anyone who
bothers to do the research, instead of joining in with his hateful
chorus, could find out for themselves just what frauds that he, and
this awful movie, really are.

This movie is nothing more than worthless liberal propaganda. If it
moves you in any way than you are only proving that you are as stupid
as the Americans Moore is always trashing. Honestly anyone can take a
bunch of quotes out of context and edited film to make someone look
bad. This will of course wow the uninformed public over to Moore's
point of view, as for stupid people this propaganda technique is very
effective.I would like to inform people of recorded parts in this film according
to TIME magazine, which lists parts in this movie that are blatantly
misleading and corrects them:(I will only summarize them)- Saudis were questioned before leaving after 9/11 and only one plane
TOTAL was permitted to leave before airspace was cleared. The FBI has
files of questioning around 30 Saudis.- The firms Saudis invested 1.4 billion in "connected to Bush": 1.18
billion of the money was in a US Defence Department owned company that
trained Saudi troops. At the time of the donation Bush did not even own
the company; it was owned by the Carlyle group, on which Bush served on
the advisory board.- A pipeline Moore says Bush planned and this caused him to favor the
Taliban rulers was in fact planned during the Clinton years. Bush never
met with Taliban rulers. (THEREFORE MOORE WAS BLATANTLY LYING HERE)Do not see this worthless propaganda crap. Moore is more misleading
than he charges Bush of being.

Okay, against my better judgment I went to see the film and for about an
hour and a half I witnessed a person obsessed with his absolute loathing for
another person. My wife walked out after about 30 minutes and told me she
would wait for me in the lobby, while she was there she tried to get her
money back.
 
There were two things that I would like to say about the film:1. Moore needs to grow up. Yes, this may be a nail in the coffin of the
demise of the Bush presidency, but any point he could have made was made
moot by his obvious, repeated and childish assaults. By about 45 minutes
into the movie it actually got boring. The pattern of beating a point to
death became silly. Thanks Mr. Moore. You have made your point clear  you
don't like George W. Bush, not only as a president, but also as a person;
mostly as a person. Move on. (yawn) 2. The debates regarding who/what/when about the movie are moot. This movie
is not about facts. Moore even said so on `The Daily Show' on 6/24/04. This
is his `opinion', based upon the facts as he sees them about George W. Bush
and he is going to present them as he `sees them' about someone he does not
like. Several times my hand went up during the movie and BULLS*IT' was
uttered. It's not in what was said, it was how it was said. This is Michael
Moore vs. George W. Bush. Do not make the mistake in thinking that it is
anything noble. Like `Bowling' he is not after change, Moore is after
extracting his pint of blood and does not care how it happens.So, during the movie there were many who applauded and cheered Moore's
statements on  that is to be expected. At the end of the movie there was
light applause  expect also. What was not expected were many of the
audience actually booed and said BULLS*IT' out loud. Moore is going to make a lot of money on this film. He may even take home a
second Oscar (not because the movie is good  esthetically it's pretty
poor). He has demonstrated to me that he is a simple ambush artist that goes after
wounded prey and after President Bush is voted out of office he will claim
that it was because of THIS movie, not because Bush was simply not good
enough for the task and it became obvious to the voters of the United States
of America. The last thing that this movie has done for me is convince me that being a
conservative is a whole lot better than being a liberal, especially if Moore
is now the standard bearer for liberals in this country. Woe is to the clear
minded and rational liberals of the USA - you are now going to be lumped in
with this sad, pathetic excuse for a human.

While some is true some key points are not. Bush being misquoted, UBL's
family flying away while US jets are grounded, etc. 
Moore has a great gift for making movies but that is all this is, a movie
and to take it one step further a nice work of fiction. Maybe if he would
not pick and choose quotes and insert them in the story to make his point it
would have been better. Nothing more than a lot of liberal propaganda but it
is good for a laugh. 
It is fine that he does not like President Bush and Moore has every right to
put what he wants into "his movie" but the number of people who actually
believe it is all fact is down right frightening. Maybe his quote about
Americans is more accurate than I thought.
Enjoy but at least get the facts straight.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is the most controversial documentary ever made.
Michael Moore's film, which is the highest grossing documentary ever,
is an extremely one sided attack on the Bush administration,
specifically on their handling of the War on Terror post-9/11 and the
Iraq invasion. To be honest, while I classify F911 as a documentary, it
does stretch the term considerably, more often than not resembling
propaganda. In its attack on George Bush, this has as much subtlety as
Nicolas Cage when he's in maniacal mode, and this is one highly
manipulative movie. While taking Moore's choice of music, footage and
narration, you can always feel his manipulations. Some of the facts in
the film appear to be distorted and some people will absolutely hate
this movie. However, I will put this out there: Michael Moore might be
the best editor in cinema. His editing is borderline genius, and his
use of interviews, footage, music and humour, while as stated before
manipulative, is brilliantly clever and not only informative and
thought provoking, but very entertaining too.The first hour of the 2 hour documentary keeps going up and down. For
every inspired moment there's one where the editing and distortions are
too obvious. The second hour is where this really hits its stride and
becomes more neutral and spends less time forcing its message down the
viewers' throats. F911 is, in the end, a very powerful film and even
though its methods are questionable it always makes good points and
provokes thought. In terms of humour, it's often very funny and
although Moore putting all of his personality into the movie could be
seen as adding to the one-sided nature of the movie, it still gives
F911 a real sense of character and it makes for a very interesting
viewing experience. This is definitely worth watching overall. It's
flawed and I personally found it a bit grating at first, but it got
going and by the end it had grown on me a lot. Even in its weaker
scenes there's always a lot of thought and intelligence going into
every sequence. This is a bit of a marmite movie, so it's worth seeing
to see what your opinion of it is.8/10

Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a fiercely furious and unabashedly
partisan challenge to the George W. Bush administration. In his
incisive diatribe, Moore makes his points with an avalanche of facts,
wisecracks, and often-snarky, sometimes-outraged commentary. But much
more than a scathing indictment of Dubya-era complicity, Michael
Moore's exposé lays bare the devastating heartbreak now central to
America's wartime reality.Before Moore gets to America's "war-on-terror", he establishes his
argument for why Bush's Presidency is invalid to begin with. Moore
revisits the election debacle of 2000 and then shows how Bush was
essentially a lame duck President (who spent 42% of his first 8 months
of office on vacation) until the fateful morning of September 11 when
those planes slammed into the World Trade Center, forever changing
everything. In one of the more talked-about sequences, President Bush sits in a
Florida classroom and reads along with second-graders the book 'My Pet
Goat' - fitting, since Bush here, is Michael Moore's pet goat, in the
sense of the word meaning "a target of ridicule". Bush sits there
vacuously as the students read aloud; a timer on the screen tells us
that he sat there for seven minutes, his expression blank and his
manner untroubled, after hearing that the second World Trade Center
tower had been hit and that America was under attack. Nothing Moore can
say is more quietly damning than this footage.Most of the movie is wickedly enjoyable  we see President Bush talk
about terrorism when he's on the golf course, Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld explain the "humanity" of our surgical strikes and Congressmen
duck when asked if their children will enlist to fight in the war they
voted for. Much of the material about the administration and the war is
already well-known to people who follow the news carefully. But
assembled as a dossier of complex inter-relationships, conflicts of
interest, ignorance, thuggishness, it's a devastating attack. The movie provides a persuasive commentary on the long-standing ties
between the Bush family and the Saudi Bin Ladens and, more importantly,
on the Bush Administration's extravagant hoodwinking of America which,
ultimately, points us to the imbroglio in Iraq. The sentimentalism and
the clownish muckraking (laying it on thick at times with banjo music)
 both trademark Michael Moore  are certainly on display here, but
Moore isn't so fast-and-loose with them this time. He creates a true
and sober picture of the government-military nexus that feeds on
America's poor as it willfully wages a war outrageously suspect in its
motives. Moore powerfully draws attention to the toll that Bush's war
has taken on Iraqi innocents, on American soldiers and the grieving
families of those soldiers who died fighting for an unjust cause. While not a radical departure from his usual style, Fahrenheit 9/11
stands as a sign of cinematic maturity for Moore. He finally matches
his rhetorical power with an aesthetic sensibility that is at times
almost artful - moments in which he drives his point home visually in a
way that stuns you into silence. Michael Moore is angry and he wants
America to be angry with him. Regardless of where you stand in the
political spectrum, you will be!

Known for his stridently left-wing political opinions, director Michael
Moore doesn't beat around Bush; he takes on the right-wing,
conservative George W. Bush! While, some viewers will be offended by
Moore's anti-Bush message. For the most part, most American people love
the documentary for its infamous views on post 9/11 government
policies. This documentary became one of the highest-grossing
documentary of all, because of that reason, alone. So Mission
accomplished for Moore. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to
say, this film had a great smart funny tone to it. I love, how he
brought up, information that people might not know beforehand; like how
the Bin Laden family escaping from America or how Saudi Arabia can
overruled U.S policies, due to their oil relationship. Whether, if you
believe in or not with Moore's standpoint, you have to agree with me,
that the film also, created an emotionally powerful emotional
atmosphere. This film is designed to provoke strong feelings, and I
think for the most part; it worked. The movie does a great job, using
war stock footage from both the Afghanistan & Iraq War to show, how
disenchant, some of the U.S soldiers, are. The sequence with the woman
visiting the White House, after losing her child in the war is very
heart-breaking. You can't help feeling sad, that her son, die over
nothing. One of the biggest sequences in the film was when Michael
Moore approached several Congressmen confronting them about signing a
draft for their children to go fight the War. While, the sequence might
seem powerful; it rarely makes any sense. First off, not every
Congressman may have any adult children. Second off, those who are age,
can't have, have their parents can't order them to enlist. Third off,
the movie makes it seem, like members of Congress weren't willing to
send their own children, into war. However, there are, some children of
Congressmen that are serving the military, like Rep. Mark Kennedy,
which was cut from the film. Very manipulative. Moore wasn't the only
one. Moore show a montage of pitch-together old-news footages, really
capture how fear-mongering works to control the masses. It's scary
that, some people are willing to give up, some freedoms to have a
little bit of security. In my opinion, the Iraq War was a blunder &
anybody that vote for the war should admit to their mistake. Anybody
who still believes, Iraq is hiding WMD really needs to wake up. Some of
them, are so damn blinded, that they still claimed that Fahrenheit 9/11
contains a lot of distortions and untruths facts. While, there are
somethings that may be. I felt like the majority of the film, was
presented as correct facts. After all, in response to the critics,
Moore did published a list of facts and sources for Fahrenheit 9/11.
While, Moore makes most of his points, very clear with an avalanche of
facts. There were some commentary that was indeed wisecracks, cheap
shots, and outright not-well define to be, taking serious. One of the
biggest things that I hate about the film, is how the movie portrays
Saddam Hussein's Iraq, prior to the country's 2003 invasion by the U.S
military. The country is made out to look, like a peaceful, nearly
non-violence place to live, instead of the cruel place that it is. It
seems like Michael Moore forgot, how mess up, Iraq was, before 2003.
While, there's strong language, and extremely upsetting imagery, of
real-time violence. Most of the movie is wickedly enjoyable. After all,
it's fun to make fun of George W. Bush. He truly was idiotic, at times.
Still, somethings that Michael Moore's point out, were somewhat
overblown. I cannot say, I'm a big fan of Bush, but I had no problem,
in how Bush handle himself, during 9/11. While, I'm for Bush, here, I'm
glad, I'm not as blind, as Bush's followers were. It's scary, how some
of them voted for the Iraq War, without reading it. I think some of the
big reasons why, most representatives stay away from the film was due
to that fact. I really wish, the movie had more politicians'
interviews. While, the lack of cooperation from the Republican Party &
the White House is very clear. I still don't know, why Moore couldn't
find, any other upper-government bureaucrats to talk to. You would
think, Democrats and Independents parties-member, would use this medium
to voice their opinion about Bush. Undoubtedly, the movie was made in a
last ditch intent to get George W. Bush to lose the United States
presidential election in 2004. So, what happen!? Bush won, re-election,
because ex-Vice President Al Gore or Senator John Kerry fail to stand
up, here. It's seem like a very lost opportunity. They probably regret
not doing so. Besides that, I just glad, this movie was even made as
there were a lot of people trying to stop the film, from being made.
One of those people was author Ray Bradbury, which the title of the
film alludes to. His novel, Fahrenheit 451 was about a dystopian view
of the future. So adding 9/11 to it seem like a good title, but
Bradbury so upset by, what he considered the film be renamed. It wasn't
until he saw the movie, that he change his mind. Even the film's movie
production companies try to stop the film from being made. Disney's CEO
at the time, Michael Eisner, a friend of George W. Bush called
Miramax's chairman at the time, Harvey Weinstein, ordering him to drop
the film. Miramax felt Disney had no right to drop the film, since the
film's budget was well below the level that Miramax needed to seek
Disney's approval, and it would not be rated NC-17. So Miramax sued
Disney in court. They settled things out and the film was indeed shown.
Maybe not, in Saudi Arabia, but it was indeed shown. Overall: It's a
must-see movie, so check it out.

A good movie about the story on how Iraq invasion started and how
Afghanistan was ignored even though it was the caused the 9/11 by the
Bush administration. Although one side is portrayed the narrative and
dramatization is good. The movie ending with the narrator asking the
congressmen to enlist their sons to the army was good. And it is
typical of every country leaders. The movie opening with Al Gore
getting defeated in the 2001 election and how the minority community
was ignored was good and sets the scene for the entire movie. A must
movie for anyone who is interested in watching a conspiracy movie. A
good documentary movie with adequate dramatization, so it does not get
boring.

Even the ridiculous Republican Party is smart enough to identify the
numerous mistakes George W. Bush made while President of the United
Sates. Starting a worthless war that costed trillions of dollars,
killed millions of civilians, and killed a bunch of our young men and
women fighting for our country is one of them. One of the greatest and
most controversial documentaries of all time comes from no other than
Michael Moore, the "in your face" filmmaker who tackles down issues
that hurt our society. On Fox News' hit list and on liberals dream
list, Moore has a chemistry to his filmmaking that no one else
possesses. Michael Moore explores everything wrong with the Bush
administration, specifically how he handled 9/11 and created an evil
war. Moore tackles Bush's economic policies, his horrendous policies
that affected the poor, and just about everything including how he east
his cereal. Moore isn't playing hissy fit though. he takes an idea and
opens it up to see how much damage the Republican Party did t this
country and to Iraq. With a stylish and sarcastic feel to it,
"Fahrenheit 9/11" handles how we as people deal with violence and how
we respond to various situations and reminds us that non-fiction is
what we need in a time where many people to be reminded and woken up.

The only scene missing from this documentary is Israeli's Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu encouraging to remove Saddam Hussein from
power in 2002 shortly before the 2003 American invasion of Iraq for
weapons of mass destruction which were never found. I have seen all of
Moore's documentaries. Moore'd purpose in film making to inform and
entertain audiences. Michael Moore reports what isn't reported in the
news. Moore tries to get audiences especially American audiences to see
what is happening in this country. Iraq was a catastrophe built on lies
about nuclear weapons. America lost thousands of men and women serving
in Iraq. There are thousands who are permanently injured. America lost
servicemen and women at home from suicides in record rates. What was
Iraq for anyway? Oil and deals for Halliburton. It wasn't worth the
human loss and devastation.

... and thus so is this review about a film focusing on what were seen
as the effects of the second Iraq war. Let's face it. Chances are you
either loved or hated this film before you even saw it. Personally, I
liked it a great deal. I liked the fact that Michael Moore uses the
politicians' own videotaped words to indict them, but I also disliked
the insinuation in the film that American soldiers were jar-heads who
enjoyed or were callous about the killing and suffering of ordinary
Iraqis as a result of the war. His final thought in the film is an
important one - after all the lies told about why we went to Iraq, why
would anybody ever trust us again? This lack of trust was important in
the context of the 2008 Presidential election cycle. It caused an
unusually high level of participation of young people and saw voters of
all ages largely rejecting potential nominees perceived as Washington
insiders, and besides Sarah Palin, helped elect Barak Obama to the
presidency. Much of this can be traced back to the level of cynicism
Moore displays in this film.Also, and somewhat off-topic, I have to wonder how it is that Michael
Moore was able to see the damage that such quotable quotes from
conservative politicians could do, and yet then-presidential candidate
John Kerry could not in 2004? If I had been running Mr. Kerry's
campaign I would have been constantly rewinding and replaying the
moment when President Bush is speaking at a fundraiser talking about
"his base - also known as the haves and the have mores". What could
have done more damage to the President's faux image as some average Joe
who enjoys clearing brush on his ranch in Texas? At any rate, I think
that although it is very dated at this point, it is still an important
film and is worth viewing as a moment frozen in time. Just realize that
this IS Michael Moore we are talking about and that he does like to go
over the top quite a bit.

Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004): Dir: Michael Moore / Featuring: Michael Moore,
George W. Bush: Michael Moore's fantastic followup to his previous hit
Bowling for Columbine. This time he addresses issues that are kept from
the public that resulted in one of the darkest days of the century.
Moore targets U.S. President George W. Bush and various elements that
surrounded the terrorist bombings of September 11th, 2001. According to
the film Bush was warned prior to the incident but chose not to act.
Moore interviews those who have lost family to the tragedy and even
address those whose children were sent off to fight. One particularly
amusing sequence involves Moore approaching members of the White House
asking if they would send their children off to fight. Moore's film is
powerful and sad but it is not without the trademark humour much of
which makes Bush look like a jackass. One could just watch Moore make
fun of Bush for ninety minutes and that may even suffice as a passable
documentary. Moore is one of the best of documentary filmmakers whose
physical presence has become familiar. Whether viewers agree with him
or not, he certainly makes his point in his ploy against the media's
desire to exploit this stuff. A must-see for anyone seeking
understanding on what happened behind the scenes during that date that
will long haunt our memory. Score: 10 / 10

"Fahrenheit 9/11", possibly remains just as controversial now as it did
back in 2004. Where I definitely consider this documentary to be the
one where Michael's opinion really has a much larger presence than it
needs to have, it's exceptionally well put together and really shows
off some of the well known absurdities of George Bush's time as
President.Whereas the first half focuses on Bush's campaign and actions, the
remaining half focuses on the devastation of the Iraq War. The segments
where people in and outside America "cheerlead" the War, as well as the
prisoner abuse kind of unsettles and angers me. The fact that a
majority of soldiers are made up from the poorer class systems seems
like a no brainer, and I do like it when Moore tries to persuade
Senator's to sign up their children. It's crude and absurd, yet
sometimes there is no right and wrong when it comes to War.Final Verdict: The only thing left to mention is see it and make up
your own interpretation. In many ways it's all a farce, but thanks to
the freedom of speech we'll always have our own opinions. 8/10.

This movie gives us a real insight into the Bush administration. As a
17 year old just getting into politics and governments across the world
I found this very interesting because Michael Moore gives us a first
hand view on the September 11 bombings, The Iraq war and other things
that Bush has done in his term as President, Also at the start of this
film it shows us footage of Bush rigging the election form Al Gore. It
gives us expert opinions on this topic.Moore gives us the facts about the Iraq war and why this Administration
sent troops there, This documentary perhaps Is a little bit bias at
times but still delivers a great message.

I've seen too many videos that are telling us that our very own people
were to blame for 911 & I have no reason to rule that out. After-all,
look at our wonderful President! I loved the movie/documentary. Michael
Moore is a genius in my eyes & I think he should make more & more of
them and expose more people/politicians. He could actually start with
John McCain. After-all, he's just George Bush incognito. This, being an
election year, he could nail so many of them to the wall. What will
become of this country if that man, & I use the term lightly, becomes
our next President? As a matter of fact, why doesn't Michael Moore run?
There are so many people out there who are far more qualified than at
least one of the 3 who are running.

I don't understand how anyone can take this movie seriously. I felt
that this film consists of biased, moneymaking aspects to merely
attract audience by showing false controversial facts. I am not an
American, but I feel that when you have directors like this one in your
country you don't even need any enemies. Judging by the ratings this
movie has received I am amazed, once again, how good a "controversy"
sells. Truthful or not? Doesn't really matter. It has become
fashionable in the West to bash our governments,their views and
political beliefs. Agreeing with the West is extremely unpopular. It
would be boring. The sad part of it is that our adversaries are laughing at us.Well done
Moore! Your project worked! You have made a step up in your ratings.. I
suggest you do some research on each "fact" presented by Michael Moore
in this film and you would be surprised. I would give this movie a "0"
if I could. 1 from me.

I was up EXTRA early on 9/11/2001 to get the NEWEST results from
Florida's several ongoing recounts; and instead I got to see the second
(World Trade) tower hit (LIVE)... and meanwhile, Bush was deep down
(safe) in Florida. SERIOUSLY! The people in the buildings were not
traders overall, most were cleaners, guards, assistants... and in the
basement was the World Court Appeals for Economic Crimes... one of the
few hopes of third world countries. Can you say FISHY?? LATER, Condi
Rice quotes a document purported to be from bin Laden, referencing an
ability to EFFECT U.S.A. ELECTION RESULTS!!! Almost as sick as ONE
crumby VOTE on the Supreme Court deciding AGAINST THE WILL OF THE
VOTERS mind you, who will live in the WHITE HOUSE. Have you seen the
movie Fahrenheit 911?? In case you did not hear, Fahrenheit 911 was the
top candidate for Best Picture, until a right wing arse-fracking nazi
sabotaged its chances on purpose based on a technicality. Other than
"The Corporation", "Murder, Spies, and Voting Lies", "Apocalypse
Africa: Made in America" and "Red Reign" it is atop my list of ALL time
documentaries... and one of my favorite movies of ALL time.

Certain things are consistent when it comes to the work of Michael
Moore, and Fahrenheit 9/11 fits the pattern. It's sometimes humorous
(especially the use of what might be described as Bushisms), it's often
sombre (I think of the mother who lost a son in Iraq), it's almost
always thought-provoking (the army recruiters at the mall in Flint,
Michigan and the Congressmen Moore tries to convince to sign their
children up to go to Iraq.) Those are the positives. It's also - as
Moore always is - so obviously biased as to have little credibility as
a documentary. Moore doesn't like George Bush and he disagrees with the
war in Iraq; neither does he make even a pretense of fairly
representing the views of those who support the Iraq War, settling
instead for out of context quotes and caricatures from them (and yes,
indeed, Michael, there are two sides to every story - even Iraq.) I
agree with Moore on both Bush and the Iraq War. Still, I have trouble
accepting this as a serious documentary.The title misleads. What the word "Fahrenheit" refers to I'm not sure,
and "9/11" gives the impression that this film is about 9/11. Actually
that dreadful day gets little mention after the first few minutes in
which Bush gets slammed for staying at his "photo-op" at the elementary
school in Florida. That actually never bothered me. What would he have
accomplished by rushing out in a panic, anyway - and the Secret Service
was probably happy to have him in a secure location given the
circumstances. Most of the film, though, is actually a rather
devastating critique of the war in Iraq, with 9/11 simply the backdrop
to the whole thing; the administration's dishonest excuse for invading
that country. And it is effective - to a point. The problem is that by
now most people have already made up their minds. Those who are against
the war will love this; those who support it will hate it; those who
against all the evidence still think Saddam Hussein planned 9/11 will
think Moore is a traitor. I think he made a modestly interesting movie
which certainly isn't unbiased or even-handed but which probably
accomplishes what he wanted to accomplish with it. 6/10

I have never felt more angry about the western world and democracy as I
do now that I have watched this movie/documentary. I was skeptical of
the events following 9/11 before watching. Now I am dismayed that there
have not been any independent enquiries against Messrs Bush and Blair's
actions. Today, I am ashamed to be part of the western world for the
first time in my life, and will now always be so!The BUSINESS connections between President Bush, the Saudi Royal family
and MEMBERS OF OSSAMA BIN LADIN'S FAMILY must classify the events of
post 9/11 as the greatest conspiracy in the history of the world.Part of me had always dismissed allegations that the war in Iraq was
about oil and money. My conscience refused to allow me to believe that
ANYONE could be capable of waging war without just cause. Surely they
knew something more that the media had revealed about Iraq's
capabilities or connections with terror. The appalling truth is that
they didn't.I am now in no doubt that there were no weapons of mass destruction.
There was no link between Iraq and Al Queda. We were lied to about the
reasons for going to war, Sept 11 was used as an excuse to illegally
invade not 1 but 2 foreign nations and it is on ALL our consciences
that we allowed it to happen.Those most responsible (ie Bush and Blair) will never be brought to
justice. The events of the last couple of years will most probably fade
in to history under the heading of "probably best forgotten"I do not know how many lives were lost in the wars in both Afghanistan
and Iraq on all sides, but I do know that all of their blood is on the
hands of Bush and Blair. This was not a movie. This actually happened.The current political feed is "OK we made some intelligence mistakes
but Saddam was a really bad man and were better off without him so it's
all OK really" I am beginning to question if even this statement is
bourne out with any facts.How could this happen. Part of the explanation is in mass media.
Political manipulation of the worlds media has convinced billions of us
that "they must know what they are doing" How could so many of us
unquestioningly allow these events to take place. How could our
politicians lie to us so convincingly and so shamelessly.I am not a religious man but I sincerely hope there is a Hell. If there
is it has 2 reservations for Bush and Blair.

OK, lets look at this as a movie, not as something that morons are
debating because they dislike Moore's politics. I seriously doubt half
the negative reviewers even saw the film, but lets see what we have
here.First of all, its a joke that it won the golden palm as the best film
at Cannes, unless of course "Kangaroo jack II" was the only film
running against it. The movie is about 20 minutes too long, with
certain sequences just playing themselves well beyond their usefulness.
Also, so much of the film involves clips from shows like "Larry King"
and others that you feel that you're watching something hastily edited.I felt it could have gone two ways - either as a super-serious
indictment of the War in Iraq, or as a document of the Bush
administrations actions regarding the events of 9/11. Its tough to be
both and doesn't succeed there. When Moore is TOO populist, he comes
across as preachy. However, when he pulls brilliant stunts like reading
the patriot act over an ice cream truck PA system, trying to get
members of Congress to get their own children to sign up for the draft
and the like, while cleverly editing together soundbites of Bush
sounding cavalier, self-righteous and absurd at the same time - well,
thats when the film truly hits the mark. I wish he would have gone
after the media for their complacency after 9/11 - there's plenty of
good stuff on that - but he only scratched the surface on it.Overall, an important document and sign of the times. But not a perfect
movie by any means.

I did not expect to start to cry while watching a blank dark screen and
hearing the aftermath of the first crash into the world trade center,
and then hearing the second plane hit. And I had forgotten that Bush's
inaugural motorcade was met with such fury. To learn that George H.W.
Bush is in a position to share information from his daily CIA briefing
with his employer the Carlyle Group, and tolerate the appearance of
impropriety--that he could use that briefing for financial
gain--sickened me. It was good to be reminded of these things. I am a
close reader of the news so not much was new to me here. But to see
Michael Moore reveal the Bush administration destroying what we most
value in our country--the liberties that have made us uniquely and
responsibly American--and juxtapose that destruction with the terrorist
destruction of the world trade center on 9/11 was powerful and rang
true for me.

The Disturbing Truth About Fahrenheit 9/11Fahrenheit 9/11 has been greeted with controversy ever since the media
was aware of its production. With most cases being marred by political
ideals, it is only proper that I personalize this review, instead of
generalizing due to the reality of the film's party-line politics. There is no doubt that Michael Moore's film is biased against George W.
Bush; however, the information is irrefutable and cannot be ignored.
Personally, I'm an Independent, and am praying for voters to oust Bush
out of office, however, personal agendas aside, Fahrenheit's factual
argument in irrefutable. .Instead of using his usual rant-filled voice over, Moore's commentary
reserved but effective, he lets the facts speak for themselves, and
they echo loudly. This film does not argue party lines like people
think. It is not about Liberals vs. Conservatives, Republicans vs.
Democrats, or Bush vs. Kerry. This film is about Bush vs. himself, and
how his actions before the election to date have affected us all. When
it boils down to it, the issue becomes about ethics and morality. The
facts spell it all out, and it is scary.The word 'disturbing' is occasionally used to label certain feelings
that may be attached to media. Films like The Exorcist, Schindler's
List, and Freddy Got Fingered. When it comes to content, these films
are not remotely related to each other except in the connotation that
each strikes a delicate chord with society. The Exorcist was extremely
frightening, Schindler's List was very graphic in its depiction of the
holocaust, and Freddy Got Fingered was downright vile and disgusting.
In the case of Fahrenheit 9/11 that feeling hit me. I went into the
theater expect a savvy expose trashing Bush and his ability to handle
the presidency, however I left experiencing something completely
different. I was simply disgusted by things that Bush and his
administration did over the last 4+ years. It was disturbing. Just in
case you forgot, I am an Independent. Let say, I was a party-line
Republican whose vote for Bush contributed to his re-election and then
proceeded to watch the film when it came out on video a month later, I
would be so embarrassed that I would feel too incompetent to ever fill
out a ballot again in my life.Eighty-five years ago, the Chicago White Sox were the hottest team in
baseball. They were a lock to win the World Series, but gamblers paid
eight players $10,000 each to lose the championship on purpose. One of
those players was 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson. He was given money, with no
understanding of what was going on. 'Shoeless' Joe's statistics were
phenomenal during the series, however when a jury investigated the
scandal he was implicated and in turn banned from the sport. Why did
this happen? He signed a contract that implicated him. No one
understood how this could happen, until someone saw the contact, it was
marked with an X. 'Shoeless' Joe was illiterate. He signed his career
away. The newspapers donned the headline of the little boy who ran up
to his idle and cried, 'Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so.'Well when it comes to Fahrenheit 9/11 it is so, and there is nothing we
can do about it unless you go to the polls and voice your opinion.
Whether you like Michael Moore or not, political ideals have no bearing
in the simple fact that whatever your stance, if you are even thinking
of casting a ballot the November, you must see this movie. Otherwise,
you might be the next one crying, 'Say it ain't so.'**********/**********

Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" is arguably the most important film of our
generation. Nobody that experiences the movie can deny that it is well
crafted whether you agree with what he is saying or you do not. I am an
admirer of most of the things that Mr. Moore attempts to tell us, the people
of the United States, to prod us to become active in the democratic process.
I believe 100% of what this documentary tells us about Bush I and Bush II
waging war for control of Iraq's oil reserves and enabling their rich
friends (as Bush is quoted in the movie addressing his supporters at a white
tie fundraising dinner: "This is an impressive crowd -- the haves ... and
the have-mores. Some people call you the elite; I call you my base.") to get
richer by awarding fat government defense contracts to their
businesses.The movie should win the Academy Award for Best Picture because it is a
great movie whether you believe it is fact or fiction. Hopefully, when it
does win the statuette in March 2005 the movie will have been a part of
kicking Bush's regime out of the White House. The final point Moore makes in
the movie that Bush attempts to use but cannot verbalize: "Fool me once
shame on you." (2000 election) "Fool me twice shame on me." (2004
election)"

The issues brought up in this film are important enough that they should be
given a good hard look.  Whatever conclusion you ultimately come to, if
there is even the most remote chance that any of this is true, then we would
be fools not to.  Critics claim that what is suggested in this film is lies.
 That possibility exists.  However, there is more evidence to support the
state of affairs in this film than was ever presented in defense of our
going to war in Iraq.  So why did we go to war over there?  Perhaps it is
that this film finally offers some real answers.  That would do it for me,
however I need to complete 10 lines so I'll fulfill that obligation like
this.

I found Michael Moore's latest film, Fahrenheit 9/11, to be surprising,
moving and funny; overall very well done. There was a little too much
'name-calling' type humor for my taste, and I found my thinking less
provoked than his prior film, 'Bowling for Columbine.' I also thought
it exploitative to use a distraught Lila Lipscomb crying for her son
killed in Iraq, but such dramas are what makes for engaging and
eye-opening cinema. Criticisms of his film aside, I'd like to put
things into perspective. Michael Moore has made himself into a genuine
American working class hero, without help from rich relatives, or a
willing corporate elite. Tough, very tough to do these days. He is
caught in a no-win media gambit: he wants to reach a wide audience with
shocking revelations of widespread corruption, deceit and lies, yet he
knows to reach more folks, he needs to be more entertaining to bring
folks into the theater. Judging from the incredible success of his last
two films and every book he writes, I'd have to say he has a winning
formula. His films, I believe, are all about teaching us-by
example-that average folks can make a difference in the world. Just get
your nerve up and do something. You don't have to be an expert. And
this last piece of 'advice' I've gotten by his example we would be wise
to take to heart: It's our country, our democracy to give away or take
back! The choice is up to each one of us.It appears too many of us are too quick to judge his pandering,
impolite, confrontational style. If you think about it, a polite and
subdued populace is very much in the interests of the status quo.
That's not to say we should all go out into the streets and start
burning cars and trash cans like the anarchists at the Seattle WTO
protests of '99. But there is a definite role for a personality like
Michael Moore. He represents, in my mind, a courageous tiger speaking
out for those without voice and defending their interests. Dangerous by
any measure from the perspective of the right wing and their
apologists!What I also appreciate so much about Mr. Moore is that he knows what it
takes to BOTH entertain and challenge. And by challenge I mean both the
public's minds and the status quo. And here is where the courage comes
in. He's not afraid to be wrong. That's anathema to the middle-class
instinct (I include myself) towards waiting until we have all the facts
and waiting until the appropriate number of experts have given us
permission to act. Democracy lives and breathes by our enthusiastic
involvement and cannot wait for marginal voter turnout every four
years. I will also say that outrage has so few outlets in our society
and especially our tightly-controlled media. As the bumper sticker
says, 'If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.' Michael
Moore is paying attention and he deserves our thanks for the role he
plays in kicking some ass.

I didn't vote for any Bush, and I won't this time either. This film
didn't tell me much that was new, but it put it all the anti-Bush
stories and perspectives together into one visual record and inspired
me to make my first donation to a political party, with the goal to
pull bush out of the Whitehouse by his roots. Even if only half of what
Moore postures to be true is indeed true, we've been misled and
manipulated, at a huge cost in dollars and lives, and we have been led
into a war that could make us more vulnerable to terrorism than ever
before. I hope we are successful in making a democracy over there, but
as a show of how a democratic society is supposed to work, lets do a
regime change over here! Pray we get a better vote count this time.

I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 last night at the Spectrum theater in
Albany and was amazed to see that there are still long lines to get
tickets to the movie. My girlfriend and I barely got tickets!This movie made me laugh, cry, and think. I recommend this movie to
everyone. Regardless of your political persuasion, you will find this
movie informative and compelling.Although I am a registered Republican, I found this movie to be an
excellent synopsis of the incredibly transparent corruption in our
government and a call to save our country. I hope that Michael Moore's newest documentary will be released over
seas as well so that others may know that the American people were
never behind the Bush regime and that we have been subjugated by our
ignorance and capitalist disinformation / brainwashing campaigns.I am too old to believe that any one group is totally right and one
group is totally wrong. There are always many sides to every situation.
However, the one clear observation that I take away from this movie is
that wars are never fought by countries. The only true war is the war
of the ruling class on the lower classes, to maintain hierarchy.

I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today, thinking I knew what I was in for.
I was an avid fan of Michael Moore's work previously - having watched
Roger & Me and Bowling For Columbine and read his last two books,
Stupid White Men and Dude, Where's My Country - and so I figured I was
in for the usual expose into how horrible things were right now and how
those in power were screwing us in many uncomfortable places (yes, even
the back of a Volkswagen).I was right, but to put it in baseball terms I expected a slow pitch
and got smacked in the head with a bean-ball.I will honestly admit that Michael Moore's books and previous films are
not for everyone. Not every American appreciates his views on the way
Americans have the wool pulled over their eyes, not everyone agrees
with the way he goes about things, and many more people just plain
dislike him. To those people, I say this: You cannot call yourselves
properly informed about what is going on inside your borders until you
see Fahrenheit 9/11. Plain and simple.Rather than his usual quoting of stats, facts and figures to back up
his claims, Moore this time lets the footage do the majority of the
talking for him. Sure, he adds his own commentaries - it wouldn't be a
Moore film without them - but Fahrenheit 9/11 strikes a blow to the
heart that commentaries on gun control and corporate greed simply
cannot.Whether you were directly affected by the September 11 attacks, whether
you have a loved one serving in the US or Coalition forces anywhere
abroad, whether you've called America your home for your entire life
and four generations before you or whether you're like me and only
moved here two months ago... I will say this in uppercase so it stands
out from the rest of my diatribe: FAHRENHEIT 9/11 IS A FILM THAT YOU
HAVE TO SEE. Once you've seen it, grab someone who's never seen it and
take them to see it, then tell them to do the same.I feel sorry for anyone who feels the need to bash Moore simply based
on the way he delivers his message, or the right-on-the-money message
that it is in the first place. I am telling them, especially, to go see
it for yourself.You may not agree with everything he says, but at least you can call
yourselves informed and can draw your own conclusion.

I submitted a review of this film after seeing it on opening night. For some
reason IMDB chose not to post it. I'm sorta glad. It gave me a chance to
read a bunch of other reviews on this site.I notice that, even though over 90 percent of the reviews I read were
positive, the film only gets around an eight. A number of people rated the
film a minimal score of one. I wonder if they saw this film before rating
it. I doubt it.All the negative takes on the film seem to have a couple of things in
common: either they indulge in ad hominem attacks on Moore ("This is a
terrible film. And Michael Moore is fat") or they say that the film is full
of lies without providing any examples.Documentary films, more than any other form, are made about subjects that
the filmmaker feels strongly about. And Moore is obviously upset about the
"pass" that the media has given to Bush and his Administration.There was very little in this film that was new to me. But I've had to go
looking for it. The So-called Liberal Media, if it reports on it at all,
buries it deep in the paper. Most of what I know is from newspapers in other
countries, like England, Canada and Australia.The truth, like water, always finds an outlet. If the newspapers and
broadcast media (the latter in the hands of just 6 corporations now) had
been doing their job, there would be no need for the avalanche of books that
have come out in the last year or two. And there would have been no need for
a film like "Fahrenheit 9/11".I hope that every voter (especially those who didn't cast a ballot in the
2000 race) sees this film with an open mind. If he/she disagrees with
Moore's position, that's fine. But don't do so on the basis of the knee-jerk
reaction of the right that says that if you disagree with what the President
is doing, then you must be anti-American, a terrorist sympathizer or someone
who "doesn't support Our Troops".Freedom of Speech is one of our most treasured rights as Americans. Without
it, and the free and open debate that flows from it, democracy itself is at
risk.See this movie with a friend. Argue and debate what it says. But don't
condemn it out of hand because it contradicts your world view. That's
un-American.A must-see. Ten stars.

*** LOTS OF SPOILERS***For all the people who are calling Michael Moore's movie a bunch of
lies and deceitful banter, you really need to go back and see the movie
again. Mr. Moore mostly lets the footage speak for itself. Watching
President Bush be informed about the Twin Towers being struck by a
second plane and then watching him steer blankly at a children's book
should be a serious WAKE UP call to all the fools who voted for this
man. President Bush was never truly fit to run our country and the
overly rich people and corrupted government who pushed him into the
White House are now looking like idiots. Bush looks totally LOSSED
sitting in the classroom and without his advisors he doesn't know what
to do. I sat in the theater and just shook my head. It was like he
already knew something like this was going to happen sooner or later.
He doesn't even looked shocked, but more puzzled.Michael Moore shows what happens when republican government cheat the
people of the U.S. to elect an incapable President. It was quite
obvious that President Gore (yes, he should be President right now) was
shafted after 1000's of minority votes were eliminated from the tally.
Bush has his brother and friends to thanks for that. Even when the
minority people (mostly Black American) tried to instate a recount
there wasn't one Senator who would signed the proposal. More corrupt
B.S. One of the things I didn't realize was that President Bush's inaugural
event was a bust after people started egging his limo and riots broke
out. For some reason, I don't remember seeing this on T.V. Where was
the press? After watching this movie, there are so many unanswered
questions that need to be answered by President Bush and his staff of
stooges. Like why was the Bin Laden family allowed to leave the U.S.
without being questioned by the FBI and CIA? Any U.S. citizen that
committed a crime of this magnitude would have had their entire family
arrested. Why was the search for Bin Laden suddenly halted and then
turned to Saddam Heussan who wasn't involved at all in the 9/11
attacks? Did the Bush's investments in defensive corporations have
anything to do with Bid Laden, his family and the focus being turned to
Saddam? Of course it did.I laugh at people who put down President Clinton for lying about having
sexual relations with Monica. Lewinski? What did Clinton's lie have to
do with how he ran the government? Absolutely NOTHING. It made his
integrity look bad, yes, but he still was doing a much better job at
running the country then both Bush men put together. He actually
lowered the country's trillion dollar deficit and that's a fact. The
unemployment was at it's lowest in years when Clinton was in office.
Clinton's lie compared to Bushes lies are like night and day. Why?
Because Bush's lies actually effect people's lives. There were NEVER
any Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq. Bush sent our men and women
their to fight a war that was never needed (except to make the Bush's
and Saudi Arabians more wealthy). These are facts people. Michael Moore
proves this and no one is disputing the claims. If MM was smart he'd go
into hiding for a year, as he's probably a wanted man by every
government assassin out there. President Bush should retire and go back
to doing what he does best. Playing golf!!Moore's film is brilliant and very well filmed. I thought it might be
boring when I first started watching it, but I was totally engrossed
through the whole film. It amazed me how the Marine recruiters steered
clear of the rich people in Michigan and instead heading for the poor
minority urban areas to recruit men and women for the Marines. Why is
this? Rich people are too good to fight the war for their country?
B.S.!! I laughed when Mr. Moore went to Washington D.C. to ask the
Senators if they would enlist there kids into the service. They looked
at him like he was nuts. Every Senator out there (except one) believes
their kids are too precious to be enlisted. Well, the poor minority
folks believe the same thing. What happens is because they are so poor
and without jobs, that they have almost little choice but to enlist
just so they can make a living and work. I personally will NEVER send
my kids to any government defense service. I don't believe in WAR and I
definitely don't believe in meaningless war like the one we waged in
Iraq. Even the soldiers who are there don't know why they are still
there. More and more of them are dying right now for NO GOOD REASON.
The person to blame is none other then President Bush and his staff. Anyway, definitely see Fahrenheit 9/11. It will change the way you view
the government. People keep saying this in M. Moore's opinion, but as
you can see the people of the U.S. are doing most of the talking in the
film. So you are calling all these people liars are well. Sorry if the
FACTS hurt, but it's about time someone told the truth and exposed the
government and all it's corruption. I pray that one day the government
is no more. It may have been a good idea back when George Washington
was around, but it's totally corrupt now. U.S. may be land of the free,
but it's the home of corrupted overpowered old men. They need to
remember that they can't take the power & money with them when they
die.I give Fehrenheit 9/11 a rating of 9/10.

Moore does two excellent things in this movie.  He shreds George W. Bush & Co. in joyously vicious lampoonery.  I'd have
laughed if I wasn't already crying.  Well...  I guess I laughed
anyway.And, he lays out the case against Bush, the Bush family, their friends and
supporters in exquisite detail.  He does a job that would do any skilled
government prosecutor proud.  Better than the 9/11 Commission, the Warren
Commission and the Watergate Commission rolled into one.  Never mind swaying
an election, he lays out a pretty good case for impeachment and hanging. 
Seriously.Unfortunately (for me, anyway) he does one more powerful thing which I
didn't exactly "enjoy".  Moore provides a powerful emotional catharsis for
the loss and pain of 9/11 and Iraq.  I sobbed.  Who knows, maybe it did me
good to get it out of my system and I should send him a check for the
therapy session.  I'm still a bit teary the next day.  Luckily though, the
scenes that set me off were actually quite short and not everyone had my
reaction.  Most of the packed house (at 5:50pm on a Sunday!) seemed to have
had a clearly enjoyable time.  Oh, people?  Leave your small children home.  This movie is totally
inappropriate for them.  At the very least they'll be loudly fussy and
cranky and disturbing to the other patrons during the quiet and emotional
scenes.  At the worst, they'll have nightmares for years.

Michael Moore is a man people love to hate.  I, myself, am on the fence. I
didn't particularly enjoy "Bowling for Columbine" and I've not seen his
earlier work, but "Fahrenheit 9/11" is an astounding film. Factually sound
and relentless in its assault on the Bush White House, "Fahrenheit" takes us
from a real art-house opening with the audio-only attacks on the World Trade
Center to the run-down neighborhoods of Flint, Michigan, to the front lines
of Iraq.Particularly notable during the Iraq segments is the Fallujah debacle,
complete with charred corpses being dragged through the streets and beaten
with steel rods. Whether or not you think an R rating is appropriate, the
film certainly earns it with these grotesque and horrifying
scenes.More important than the Bush-Bashing, I think, is the expose of the
Military-Industrial Complex (which Bush and Cheney happen to be part of).
Moore expertly connects the dots between the Bushes and oil-rich arabs. What
we're left with is the government and cowed mass media badgering a populace
to start a war which is in no way involved with the attacks of September
11th... a war not about WMD or al-Qaeda, but a war about the second largest
known oil reserve in the world.The only thing I would have to liked to see in Moore's "Fahrenheit" is
republican Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address, warning Americans about
the dangers of the Military-Industrial Complex... which is in full swing
here.9/10

Michael Moore started to intrigue my interest in Documentaries. Before his
film, `Bowling for Columbine' was released in 2002, I probably had very
little interest in that area of film. However after viewing `Bowling for
Columbine' I became very interested in the documentary area of Film. I
personally really admire Michael Moore for his work and his ability to talk
about serious issues in his documentaries. I would like to say that I was
really looking forward to Fahrenheit 9/11 even before all the controversy
started up about the film. But let me say something else about this film and
that is it's not the same type of documentary like Bowling For Columbine,
The Big One, or Roger and Me is. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a different type of
documentary all together and Michael Moore himself is barely in the film but
plays the part as the narrator. Fahrenheit 9/11 is easily Michael Moore's best work to date and this is
probably because the movie talks about issues that are still going on now in
the world and because Moore himself does not try to persuade you to believe
in what he is saying but actually shows `facts' from newspaper articles,
news programs, interviews, and actual documents. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a film
that talks about 9/11, how George W. Bush and company had ties to the Saudi
Families, how George W. Bush quickly forgot about Bin Laden and just placed
the blame on Saddam Hussein, and finally talks about why the hell we are
still at war.Love Michael Moore, Hate Michael Moore, Fahrenheit 9/11 is not Moore's
typical film. Even if you typically don't agree with Moore, I feel this
movie is important for everyone in America to see. As I said earlier you
barely see Moore during the movie. I think he actually shows up 3 times for
a very short period of time. This movie is more about stating facts than
opinions. The movie makes a lot of sense for those who don't believe we are
living in the picture perfect world. It talks about how our government lies
to us and how we have an idiotic `War' president running this country.
George W. Bush always came off like an airhead to me but after seeing this
film that is officially confirmed. Moore even interviews troops that are
fighting in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's seems most don't even
understand why they are at war and why they are still over there. Michael
Moore even interviewed one troop who came back from the war and stated that
he rather be thrown in jail then go back to war because he just couldn't
figure out what the hell he was fighting for. A lot of pretty shocking and
depressing stuff is being talked about in this film.Fahrenheit 9/11 is not like `Bowling For Columbine' in the sense that it's
not nearly as amusing. Sure, some of this movie is funny but the majority of
this is serious. I personally was on the verge of tears during some of the
film because it was depressing and sad. However, I know life isn't always
great and people have a lot of hard times and bad things happen to good
people. This movie makes you think about the issues that are going on today
like how over 800 died in the war so far, the rise and the decline of the
economy, the losses of jobs, and many other things.This is without a doubt the best movie you will see all year and that is
because it's an important movie to see. You will learn very important
information from this movie about George W. Bush and the current state of
the United States. Sure some of this will shock you and some of it will make
you depressed but I think ultimately it will be a movie that helps the
American Citizens make a difference. Even if you Hate Michael Moore, I
believe this film deserves a chance because of the actual footage that is
being displayed. It's an important film for everyone to see who is planning
on voting in the next election. Go by yourself, Go with Friends, but
ultimately see this movie because it's important and should be seen by all
Americans.If Michael Moore ever runs for President he has my vote. I think Fahrenheit
9/11 is the best documentary that he has ever put out so far. I am a big
supporter of this man and each of his documentaries is more important than
the next. This movie as many already know has taken the box office by storm
with over 21 million dollars and the movie is only showing in 868 movie
theaters. I had to purchase my tickets for this film two days in advance and
stand on a 30-minute line to see the film but was it worth it? Absolutely. I
like movies that challenge me to think, make me feel real emotions, and make
me want to do something about the current state of the United States. I will
continue to support this movie by seeing it a few more times and tell most
of the people I work with or talk with, to see this movie. I think it's
shocking, depressing, and funny but most importantly a serious film that
talks about serious issues. My rating for Fahrenheit 9/11 is a big
10/10.

I saw Moore's film today because I am firm believer in the principle that
one ought to give something a fair hearing before praising or criticizing
it.  Furthermore, as a student of politics, I think this is an
extraordinarily important film insofar as it may have a tremendous impact on
the American political landscape.STYLE:
Independent of the film's content, which I will discuss below, this is
outstanding work.  Moore is a master of manipulation - he is able to weave
images, words, and music in a way that is truly remarkable.  After viewing
his films, I usually find myself admiring his skill as a filmmaker.That being said, I am firmly in the camp of those who believe Moore's films
are not, properly speaking, documentaries.  Obviously, this contention
depends on how we define the term, but suffice it to say that there is a big
difference between Errol Morris and Michael Moore.  Although both deal with
"non-fiction" subjects, Moore's projects seem much more willful and
agenda-driven.  Without meaning to use the term derisively, Moore's films
are more accurately described as propaganda.  He does not "allow facts to
speak for themselves," as he is so fond of saying.  Rather, he manipulates
facts by shading, twisting, and simplifying them.  As such, it is fair to
say that what Moore does is much closer to Leni Riefenshtal than it is Errol
Morris, who allows his subject to exist relatively independent of his will.
(My comparison to Riefenshtal is NOT intended to be substantive, but rather
stylistic).SUBSTANCE:
In terms of the content of the film, only so much can be said here.  (I
recommend Christopher Hitchens' treatment of the film's content on
Slate.com).  At the point where style and substance meet, the most
disturbing thing about Moore is his tendency toward simplification.  If only
the moral and political world was as simple as Moore describes it!  Perhaps
the most unsettling aspect of Moore's film is not any of the many logical
leaps he makes dissecting the inner workings of the Bush administration. 
Rather, it is his complete lack of humanitarian concern for what is going on
around the world.  If Fahrenheit 9/11 is to be believed, Iraq was one of the
happiest places on Earth before the war began.  Apparently, it was a country
of beautiful children laughing on playgrounds and playing with kites.  Like
his dismissive attitude toward the genocide in Kosovo in Bowling for
Columbine, Moore seems completely insensitive to the plight of the victims
of totalitarian thugs.  In recent interviews, Moore has said that liberation
must come from within a country (See Cannes Press Conference).  Once again,
if only it were so simple.  It is easy to say that while you sit at your
computer in Manhattan.  It is a bit harder for the men, women and children
that are being brutalized in these various countries. War is indeed an awful thing. Moore should be applauded for bringing that
point home with such vigor.  With that being said, however, I think all of
us would do well to reflect upon the tensions between pacifism and
humanitarianism.  Oh how we all wish that we could have it both ways. 
Unfortunately, we live in a complicated world.  It is all the more
unfortunate that BOTH Mr. Moore and Mr. Bush fail to realize
that.

As a 9/11 family member,I was invited to a small private screening of
this movie before it's "official" opening in Cannes. This
movie deserves to be seen, no matter what Disney says. Michael Moore
does a fantastic job of exposing abuses within the Bush administration.
It's amazing that the coziness of the Bushes and the Saudis had never
been reported on in this much detail before. ("liberal media"
my eye) Conservatives will not like this movie, but they should watch
it anyway. Even if you disagree with Micheal Moore's politics, this
movie will make you think long and hard about the direction the country
is moving in. If you aren't concerned, you very well should be. There
are some truly funny moments, and some very touching moments as well.
Watch it with an open mind and form your own opinion, but watch
it.Personally I think Fahrenheit 9/11 delivers a very important message
that needs to be heard.

Directed by Michael Moore, whose aura of controversy only grew after
his Oscar acceptance speech at the 2003 Academy Awards, Fahrenheit
9/11, like Moore's Bowling For Columbine and Roger & Me, promises to
expose the corporate wrongdoings and big-money scandals perpetrated by
America's financial elite.The film takes a critical look at the
presidency of George W. Bush, the War on Terror, and its coverage in
the news media. The film is the highest grossing documentary of all
time.In addition to criticizing the administration's handling of the
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade
Center, Moore digs deep into the surprising relationship with the Bin
Laden family held by both Bush administrations, and questions whether
or not potential Saudi involvement with the attacks has been ignored.This is Moore's most powerful movie -- the largest in scope, the most
resourceful and skillful in means -- and the best things in it have
little to do with his usual ideological take on American power and
George W. Bush.Obviously,it was a film full of rage against the former
43rd President of the United States.But despite the fact that this is
an extremely one-sided in its indictment of the Bush
administration,this is one worth watching documentary for the humor and
the debates it'll stir as well as the satisfaction and entertainment
one gets from the film.

A roaring triumph at Cannes, Fahrenheit 9/11 is surprisingly not
nominated for an Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. The Golden Palm
winner is one of the most provocative films to come out of the new
millennium. The man behind it is no stranger to controversy either:
Michael Moore writes, produces, and directs the hit film. Sandwiched
between Oscar-winning Bowling For Columbine (2002) and Oscar-nominated
Sicko (2007), Fahrenheit 9/11 is more serious and less humorous, but
equally well-researched and argued.Fahrenheit 9/11 explores issues leading up to the September 11 tragedy
as well as the consequences thereafter. Viewers are brought back to
that hotly-contested election that pitted Al Gore against George W.
Bush. Bush wins it and assumes his role as the President. In this film,
however, Bush assumes the role of a target board, a helpless lame-duck
who is viciously hacked down by Moore who shows completely no sympathy
for a man he feels should be held responsible for the suspect handling
of the 9/11 incident and the innocent lives lost in the absurd invasion
of Iraq.Moore is at his scathing best in Fahrenheit 9/11. He makes accusations
towards the Bush Administration and backs it up with solid facts from
reliable sources. Using a mix of archival footage and scenes he shot,
Moore gives viewers a rare glimpse into the lifestyle of Bush, his
infamous 'Pet Goat' reaction to the news of 9/11, his almost
family-like links with Saudi Arabia (the country which produced more
than three-quarters of the terrorists responsible for 9/11), and an
eye-opening but disturbing look at the struggles and sufferings of
Iraqi civilians and American soldiers in Iraq.There is still that sarcastic Mooresque humor that pops up once in a
while despite the seriousness. Even then, one may feel there is an
information overload and this makes it less fun to watch than his other
features. However, Moore succeeds in making us seethe in anger (which
is the whole point of the film). And with a bit of subtle manipulation,
he even leaves room for us to shed a tear or two through mournful
interviews with parents of soldiers killed in Iraq.Fahrenheit 9/11 is an important addition to the world of cinema not
because it is a great film (it is not Moore's best output either) but
rather it uses the medium so purposefully and convincingly that
firstly, it tells the truth which most would have realized by now, that
Bush is no better than a terrorist; and secondly, it gives defeated
Americans a powerful voice that has been consistently silenced by the
Bush Administration. Never has the virtue of 'freedom of speech and
expression' been so patriotically emphasized in a film. The fact that
this film even exists is astonishing. Yes, Fahrenheit 9/11 falls short
of greatness, but no one would agree that it is not a liberating
experience.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.

As an outsider, I have to expose my opinion on this recently seen film.
I wouldn't merge into American Policies nor it's propaganda attempts
onto Moore's calendar of irony, but just review the movie as a
documentary. And I believe there is just a limbo between the
documentary and the movie nature of this...product.How can't I like Moore? His humour is spicy, rectal, sharp and direct,
shameless of responses and reactions, every word he speaks blades a
double edge. Doesn't matter on which side you stand, you got to
acknowledge the guy's charm. But there is something I find incomplete: Moore renders politics with
an eye that few might call "integral". His lateral view on things seem
biased, showing only clipped sides of the story. He seems that when he
is in problems he will edit the scene and go forth with obsolete
critics. It's interesting, funny and attractive, but I really doubt the
nature of being either a propaganda attempt, or a true documentary. A
true documentary should stay true to the Integral vision of the things
and present them clearly with no subjectivisms. All I can see is Moore,
disliking the government and with power on his hands directing an
instrumental attack regardless of constructive criticism.A five sounds fine, because it is intelligent and fun, but since it's
not fully compromised with the whole nature of things, I beg for Moore
to overcome his whimsies and propose practical, beneficial help with
his camera and witty charm.That's my two cents.

I am studying in the United States and originally from the Middle East.
From my point of view, Fahrenheit 9\11 brings the audience most of the
truth (spoken and unspoken) about the Bush administration. It lays a
stress upon how meaningless the war in Iraq was and really strong in
the way that it shows how both Iraqi and American families suffered. I
think its strongest effect on me was that I really felt that I and all
the people in the Middle East had to actively do our best at least to
share the grievance of the Iraqi people. Maybe we can't go there and
stand against American troops and convince them that this war isn't
just, actually movie tells us that they have also seen the reality but
unfortunately they are under command. However, there is still a lot we
can do and have to do as the tragedy goes on in Iraq. Americans also
need to be more conscious and operative against these weapon and oil
barons that have lot to determine and blacken their future. I think it
should be all of our duty as human beings with decent reasoning to
stand up and do our best starting tomorrow against this tragedy.

OK, this is not actually a movie, its a documentary. Im not a USA
inhabitant, but I saw the pain that September 11 caused. I was wanting
to see this documentary for a long time, M.Moore is an excellent
documentalist because he makes them from an outside point, he forgets
the BS of being a fake patriot, and goes up to the power to defend the
commoners, the cannon meat as politicians used to call them. The
documentary is great, depicting a whole business hidden from many
Americans while they were told that they were actually "freeing" Irak.
The oil business. The movie shows both politicians and big companies
debating the division of the oil income, and isn't that just great, a
mother loses her children, a wife her husband, a son his father, and
all that companies and the government that supposedly cared about you,
the USA people, actually care about is money income and money income.
Today was the first time I saw the documentary, I already new some
things, mostly because living outside of the USA gives us more
uncensored news. But, the whole deal between Bush and the Bin Laden,
the promotion to government position of former employees, the
participation of the Bin Ladens as contributors(share holders) of one
of the companies that is "helping" the US corps, and the participation
of the division of the oil of companies like DHL and, guess who,
MicroSoft. Yes, the giant of information is making profit of every
dead, injured, active soldier. I know that in the USA M.Moore is known
as an anti American, but if defending the helpless is anti patriot in
any country in the world, then we actually deserve to be wipe out of
the earth. To the people that has family members in active service, or
are planning to do some service, don't do it, you are not helping your
country, your are helping corporations like Bush hidden business, DHL
and MS to make profit out of your life and your comrades life.

What a controversial discussion this film causes!! Love it, hate it,
narrow minded, open minded, I just wanna talk film!! I SOO expected to
love this movie, all my friends and relatives expected me to love this
movie. This movie was just okay. First off I will let readers no I am
NOT a republican, I am a student of politics, I love American politics
and I am a staunch democratic supporter!! I am not a fan of Bush and I
was in shock and disgust to learn he had been voted in again. VOTED IN
AGAIN PEOPLE!! Apparently this film didn't make that much of an impact.Fahrenheit 911 for those of you living in an underground cave and
haven't heard of it is film maker Michael Moore's testament to the
underhanded and misleading facts behind the Iraq war and the 911
attacks. He uses interviews with victims, soldiers, congressman, and
news footage, war footage, alleged "facts" in order to prove his point. The film is entertaining, Michael Moore is ALWAYS entertaining.
Unfortunately he aims for entertainment over truth I think. Moore
creates and edits his way through facts in order to try and sway people
to his opinion. I believe the definition of a documentary is a film
that presents facts objectively without editorializing. Moore goes way
beyond editorializing and turns his films into an essay style where he
is trying to prove his point. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Free
speech all the way but let's not shroud it in a "documentary."The first half of the film I found myself getting annoyed with Moore's
constant bring up "facts" with no idea as to where he gets these facts,
where they are found or where to look for them. He brings up
connections between Bush and Saudi Arabia, the Bin Laden's, different
corporations and I don't dispute these facts, he may very well be
correct but he doesn't give any indication as to where this information
is coming from even to say a private source would be helpful. How can
you believe something with seeing the evidence to back it up??Moore's absolutely amazing editing ability could turn Santa Clause into
an evil looking criminal. The way he cuts and hacks news stories,
photo's and audio clips to make the person look downright guilty is
unfortunate and unfair when trying to make an impartial decision. The
second half of Fahrenheit goes right for the emotions. We see how the
war and the taking of young soldier's life effects ONE woman and her
family. I KNOW there are other families out there he could have
interviews, why ONE woman to get his point across. I just don't believe
he did everything he could have done to make a captivating and
realistic plea to ending Bush's own regime of terror.It makes for an interesting conversation piece but truly if the facts
Moore presented in this film were as true as he claims them to be I
think there would be a bigger investigation going on and I think Bush
would have been forced to make a statement or perhaps even resign but
the film barely made a wave in reality to the American people and this
is proved fact because who is your sitting President?? Oh that's right
the man voted best Villain in a movie on MTV. Michael Moore is sitting
on his mountain of cash thinking about who next he can victimize rather
than using his talent to truly bring out the facts. He's a talented man
and he can swing people's views but for me Fahrenheit didn't cut it. I
was sadly disappointed and I wanted to love this film. Still check it
out because everyone has and everyone is talking about it!!6/10

**** Forget your pre-conceived notions about who or what Michael Moore
is or stands for - while 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is clearly 'Anti-Bush' and
thus ruffles many patriotic American feathers, the one thing any
detractors need to realize upon viewing F9/11 is this: MOORE DID
**NOT** PUT ANY WORDS INTO GEORGE DUBYAH'S MOUTH!You will see the President's mindless blather, the gaffs, the blinking,
the blinking, the oh-so-frequent-blinking, the mouth open & not knowing
what to say or do, will see how reliant he is on his support network
below him to, and will see the now famous, ever pathetic, and frankly
shocking lack of urgency in his reaction to being told of the terrorist
attacks on New York's World Trade Center's Twin Towers.This is all REAL. This is all Dubyah. America, this is your President!!It is your President, as presented by Michael Moore, make no mistake
about it. But Moore does a fine job of offering the viewer a 'closer
look' at the President, and as a result Fahrenheit 9/11 a 'must-see'
film.Forget Iraq. Forget Saddam Hussein. Forget the oil. Forget the
corruption. Forget the War on Terror, forget the "fear". Forget Michael
Moore: One simply does not expect the President of the United States of
America to make so many gaffs, make so many inappropriate remarks in
front of the cameras, and appear so clueless so often. The result is
that you wonder how anyone could have possibly voted for this man in
the first place. THIS is the leader of the most powerful nation in the
world??I am writing this 2 full days after the 2004 election results are in,
and as you all know by now, America voted for 4 MORE years of Dubyah.
The rest of the world is dumbfounded at the result (in a global
Internet "vote", only 9% of 113,522 votes went to Bush; 77% chose
Kerry). In the real world America, the east-coast, west-coast, educated
populations all voted against Bush. Rural middle-America and the
Bible-thumping southern states all voted in favour of Bush. The
consensus is clear - Americans are ignorant (of how they have been
manipulated by Dubyah), and Americans are now the laughing stock
worldwide.Hopefully now that the election is over, pro-Bush Americans who were
avoiding this film will now be curious to see what it was about it that
their fellow Republicans were so angered over. Of course, it is of no
consequence now, but do yourself a favour - watch this film with an
open mind - and you will likely realize what a horrible mistake you've
made (twice now).It's a shame that the election came about a few days into November --
I'm sure Fahrenheit 9/11 DVDs will be popular next Halloween. If you
keep your eyes open (and Moore keeps you captivated & things move along
at a good pace) - it is, in fact, pretty scary stuff.

Seems like a lot of people are upset by this movie.  It upset me too.  But
I'm not upset at Moore or the movie itself, I'm upset at the main characters
in it.  The story this film tells is deeply sad and infuriating at the same
time.I think a lot of people misunderstood Bowling For Columbine to be anti-gun. 
To me, it was not anti-gun.  Rather it explored American sensibilities and
asked questions about who we are as a nation and why we are so afraid. 
Those questions are present in F911 also.  Only this time, we're also
presented with the point of view that on top of being afraid, we've been
manipulated and cheated.  And we continue to be manipulated and cheated,
especially those most in need.Fact checking aside, I'm glad someone finally drove home the point that our
army is not 100% volunteer based, as many folks recruited come from
underprivileged backgrounds with no real choices in life.  I don't know what
the answer is, but hypocricy is certainly not.  Telling the enemy to "bring
it on" with no knowledge what it's like to serve himself is disgraceful at
best.  Wining and dining with your elite base while asking people for
sacrifices is unconcounable.  Making a buck on an unnecessary war is
murder.

The best way to start this review is to point out that there is NO SUCH
THING AS UNBIASED DOCUMENTARY. The only unbiased documentary is one in which
only footage is shown, nothing is edited, and there is no music or
narration. I myself have never seen a documentary like this, and most
likely, neither have you.As for the movie itself, calling it a documentary would still not be
entirely accurate. It's a cinematic declaration of war. Moore sheds his
heavy involvement a la "Bowling for Columbine" and prefers to let the
majority of the movie just be facts speaking for themselves. Outside of an
interview or two, the Patriot Act reading, and asking the Congressman to
sign their kids up for the war, he mostly stays behind the scenes, narrating
the scenes.And that's what makes this one so compelling. Where as Columbine was
impressive mostly for the things Moore himself said and did, Fahrenheit is
amazing for what simply happened. If Columbine was an attack, Fahrenheit is
an all-out assault. The first half hour is arguably the most compelling,
drawing ties between Saudi Arabia and the Bushes, the financial aspects of
it all, the negligence and outright corruption that filled all events
post-9/11.There is no starkly new information here if you read a lot, but for the
masses, there will be a lot of things on the underbelly of the
administration that they have not seen before. Moore doesn't make any effort
to balance his opinions, right from the get-go we see that he will be
tearing Bush down piece by piece. And it does.Naturally, Moore injects his humor in where needed to break up the
heavy-handed subject matter. Occasionally he just needs to let Bush talk and
that's that, but some segments (the bit on the Coalition of the Willing is
priceless) are simply hilarious. And the movie ends with one of the most
incredible Bush quotes of all time.Simply said, go see this movie. 9/10, for a few parts that drew on too long.
But in my small town, this is the first movie I've seen get the kind of
ovation it did.

I believe Fahrenheit 9/11 shows a scary version of the facts, but which
may be very true. Personally I adore this documentary, especially for
it's honesty and sometimes humorous way of showing one image after
another. In this way he also shows some strange twists to the stories
the world saw on the news. The way Michael Moore shows a link between
Bin Laden and Bush families, till the moment 'secret' agents come over
to ask him why he is filming the Arabic embassy...wonderful Only the
ending get's a bit too long (when he talks to families and soldiers)
but maybe this is because I'm not US citizen, and thereby less
emotionally involved Anyway, this one you have to see (unless u're a
Bush fanatic)

You could either love Michael Moore or hate him. To me, he's just one
of those regular guys who just wants to make the audience go furious at
his documentaries. I actually like this documentary. For one reason, I
don't really care who wins the election between Kerry and Bush because
both don't have the decency to stand up for what they say. If I wanted
between them to win, I would pick Bush only because he's experienced
and I actually don't trust Kerry at all. What this documebtary stands
out for, is that Moore is making Bush look bad. The scenes were
hilarious like when they are making fun of Bush sometimes like the
vacation scene and the 9/11 attack. The Iraq scenes with the soldiers
were the best part of the whole thing because all of it is actually
true and very realistic. Overall, a great documentary that has a lot of
explaining to it and if your a die hard Bush fan, don't see itHedeen's outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-

Academy Award winning director and writer Michael Moore gives us a
visual and auditory treat as we look at the lies and deception of the
Bush Administration and their handling of the events post 9/11,
including the theft of our personal liberties with The Patriot Act.There is nothing new here to those who pay attention to what is going
on in America. Political columnists like the late Molly Ivins and
others have kept us abreast of the machinations of the Bush family. We
know how George Bush has benefited with his relationships to the Saudis
and seeing them get special treatment was no surprise. We know that
Crogress doesn't read what they vote on, and many of us knew that the
Patriot Act was written prior to 9/11.But, what Moore does is wrap everything up in a nice neat package that
is easy for the uninformed to digest and learn. He is a master at using
humor to make a political point. This film should be watched every year
on his birthday.Besides that, we get to see again just what a twit Britney Spears is.

This documentary/movie is for those who are open minded and can take
criticism. Michael Moore did a wonderful job by re-collecting
testimonies, video and audio footage, and even re-creating the events
of before and after of one of the most tragical events in modern
history.Moore gives the weapons to the audience in order to create a (negative)
opinion towards Bush's government since 2000. The movie tried to work
as a an anti campaign before the presidential elections of 2004 but it
didn't fulfill it's main job. Where this movie succeeds is in the
information field. The video footage is simply brilliant because it
displays some things that not even independent news channels would air.
Take as an example Mr. Bush's behavior when he is noticed about the
9/11 attacks. He just sits down and thinks but does nothing at all,
mean while a group of kinder garden students read. That footage is more
than compromising.Also, the history behind the Talibans' relationship with the Bush
family is shocking, and disturbing."Fahrenheit" is a brave effort in the investigation field that deserves
a lot of recognition for trying to tell a hidden truth that nowadays,
it's more than well known.

It should surprise no one that Bush supporters have widely attacked this
film as "full of lies" and "not a documentary."  Some have even inaccurately
stated that Michael Moore "admitted" that it is not a documentary.  In
preface to my own comments of the film, I would like to set the record
straight: documentaries OFTEN take sides, and Michael Moore has repeatedly
said that Fahrenheit 9/11 IS a documentary, albeit one with a point of view.
 Also, please don't say that the film is full of lies (or that "half of this
movie is probably incorrect," as one IMDB reviewer said) unless you are
willing to show concrete examples.My observations:Fahrenheit 9/11 does an excellent job of pointing out some of the major
problems with Bush's invasion of Iraq that have largely escaped (at least
until recently) coverage in the mainstream media.  Moore shows the Bush
administration's efforts to create a connection in Americans' minds between
the 9/11 attacks and Iraq, then plays them off against later statements by
the same individuals that Iraq was never connected with those attacks.  He
demonstrates that much evidence countered White House claims of on-going
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs in Iraq and how subsequent
searches for WMD evidence vindicated the dissenters.  In the most powerful
part of his film, Moore speaks with the family of a soldier killed in Iraq,
with the mother showing alternately grief and outrage over the death that
need not have occurred.  Moore also discusses how close friends of Bush have
profited tremendously as a result of the invasion.Another strong point of the film describes the poor White House performance
on terrorism prior to 9/11 and poor response on 9/11.  The White House
failed to hold any meetings with their terrorism task force prior to the
9/11 attacks, failed to act against hijacked planes that remained in the air
-- in one case, for hours -- after the initial impact on the World Trade
Center, and allowed members of the bin Laden family to fly around the
country in preparation to leave the United States during a time when all
other civilian air traffic was grounded.  Moore describes all of this and
more.Not everything in the film works, however.  The first part of the film deals
with the 2000 election debacle in Florida, describing the series of steps
that disenfranchised voters and led to Bush's "victory."  While the
criticisms of the process in Florida are accurate and many viewers may be
unaware of some of the details of the fiasco, this subject is quite separate
from the main topic of the film and is better handled in columns and books
by Greg Palast or in the documentary "Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential
Election."While closer to the point, Moore also misses the mark by focusing on the
Carlyle Group: a corporate entity uniting George Bush, Sr. and others close
to George W. Bush with Saudi Arabian oil interests.  While the issue of the
Carlyle Group merits scrutiny, the group does not have clear connections to
9/11 or to US response, and no policy statements from the group that would
confirm suspicions were offered.  A better case could be made in reference
to the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), which Moore ignored
entirely.  PNAC's members fill the administrations upper echelon, and they
have publicly available position papers arguing that the US should
aggressively use its position as the world's only superpower to support US
"interests" around the world.Perhaps the most quintessentially Michael Moore section of the film deals
with Moore approaching members of Congress and asking them to send their own
children into battle in Iraq as a sign of good faith.  The effort is met
with predictable responses, as Congressmen alternatively express their
incredulity or avoid Moore entirely.  As entertaining as this and some other
moments are, the film's best feature is Moore's maturation as a
documentarian in the more serious, hard-hitting segments of the
film.Moore casts a wide net in Fahrenheit 9/11 -- at times too wide -- ending up
with a film with far more hits than misses and provides much information not
known to most Americans even today.  Isn't that what a documentary should
do?

The only positive thing that could come out of people hating this
extraordinary documentary would be for them to rush to enlist to go to fight
in Iraq. The news media chides away from showing people like that lady from Flint,
Michigan, who is, as far as I'm concerned, the true heroine of the film. Her
pain at having lost her son in Iraq is, at times, hard to take. All I could
hear around me was quiet sobbing as she was telling us the story of the
death of her son. Another thing missing from this war is the arrival of the coffins draped
with American flags. And for that matter, no cameras have gone into the
hospitals where these young soldiers who have lost hands, arms, legs, are
recuperating from wounds they have suffered from the war. The general public
has been kept uninformed about these young people so no one can witness the
end result of the war.The Iraqi conflict should have ended a long time ago if children of
privileged Americans would have died as a result of their being there. In
one of the most hilarious segments of the film, we see a few Congressmen
scurrying away from questions presented to them by Michael Moore. Of course
they have children, but, no, these kids will never see a day of combat in
their lives. We'll never see the Bush twins in beautiful downtown Baghdag
any day soon!The biggest horror of it all is the killing of innocent people during the
bombings. The images of children's bodies being dumped in communal donkey
carts are too much to take, as is the case with the Iraqi woman who is shown
crying in front of the camera as she mourns for five dead relatives that
just died in an raid. Regardless how one feels about the present administration, the facts are
there for anyone to see and reflect upon the atrocities presented in the
documentary.War is hell, no matter how anyone sugar coats it.

This is the best film to see if you want to see the worst president in
history take the worlds super power and flush it down the worlds
dirtiest toilet. His humorous, yet sarcastic depiction shows military
personnel discussing their disgust, politicians showing their anger for
this joke of a presidents foreign policy. His detailed description of
the hell the soldiers deal with on a daily basis gives us an idea of
the soldiers perspective as well as an understanding of what their
feelings are on this unjust operation. There aren't any holes with
which I could think of, it was accurate with moore's portrayal of the
relationship b/w the saudi family and bush, the strong dependence of
the US on arab oil, and the many reasons for which we continue to
occupy Iraq. This is one film that any person who want's more
information on the most corrupt administration in U.S. should watch.
This is a true documentary, one that will leave you wondering why, and
i quote the daily mirror from the UK, "How can 59,054,087 people be so
dumb". I feel this is a telling statement for anyone who has a
progressive liberal mindset. Moore makes a film that has accuracy,
humor,anger towards corruption, and an overall feel of excellence in
film making. GO WATCH THE FILM IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY .

Major General Smedley Butler of the US Marine Corps wrote back in 1933
his famous essay on modern warfare entitled "War is a Racket". Smedley
Butler served his country for over thirty years in the US Marine Corps
on three different continents in some dozen military engagements.
Having won the Congressional Medal of Honor twice, not once, for
courage and valor above and beyond the call of duty Gen. Butler came to
this sad conclusion to the service that he rendered to his country at
the twilight of his long and distinguished military career. Seventy years later Michael Moore came to the same conclusion that Gen.
Butler did: "War is a Racket". Unlike Gen. Butler who put his thoughts
on paper Michael Moore put them on film in his explosive documentary
"Fahrenheit 9/11". The movie focuses in on the fateful summer of 2001
when Pres. Bush received but ignored a CIA report on August 6, 2001
about a possible impending attack by Osama Bin-Laden's Al-Qeada
terrorist group on targets on American soil. Bin-Laden planned to use
hijacked passenger planes to pull this terrorist operation off,that's
exactly what happened on September 11, 2001 a month later. The Bush Administration used that tragic event to push for and pass the
"Patriot Act" that that compromised the US Constitution and Bill of
Rights. At the same time Pres. Bush pushed for war against Saddam
Hussein's Iraq which had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Being
that the Al-Qeada was in Afghanistan not Iraq and protected by the
Taliban who ran that country President Bush had no choice but to attack
Afghanistan. By the late spring of 2002 both the Al-Qeada and Taliban
together with their leaders Osama Bin-Laden & Mullah Omar escaped the
pursuing US and allied forces by getting themselves lost into the
rugged mountains on the Afghan/Pakistan border. Bush used only 11,000
US troops in that war, less then there are policemen on the island of
Manhattan, against a country bigger and more populated then the state
of Texas.By the summer of 2002 the Bush Administration started to mass US troops
in Kuwait for the invasion of the real target on their radar scope
Saddam's Iraq. The Bush Administration together with the cooperation of
the US media started to plant stories of Iraq being responsible for the
9/11 attacks by being allied with Osama Bin-Laden's Al-Qeada. The
American public was also told that Iraq had possession of WMD, Weapons
of Mass Destruction, and would use then on it's neighbors as well as
the United States. After months of pounding these rumors into the minds
of the American public on March 19, 2003 Bush and his Neocon/hawks
finally got their wish as the US invaded Iraq, something that GW Bush &
Co. wanted since they took office back on January 20, 2001. The Iraqi war has already cost the lives of some 12 to 15 thousand
Iraqi's and almost 1,000 US servicemen and is still going on with no
end in sight. The 9/11 Commission has come out with a statement that
Iraq had nothing at all to do with the 9/11 attacks on America and
found no evidence that Iraq had WMD. Michael Moore exposed the crude
propaganda of the Bush/Neocons in going to war in Iraq as well as
attacking anyone, like himself, who's against that war as being
unpatriotic. Moore does this by showing us those GI's who were severely
wounded in that war at a local veterans hospital which the US media
never shows and which we hardly if ever see or hear Bush or members of
his administration visit. Since the start of the war in Iraq Bush with
the majority of the congress cut as much as 60% of veterans benefits
behind the scenes. while in public Bush & Co. claimed to be such big
supporters of our fighting men and women and that anybody who was
against their policies in Iraq were bad for the troops fighting and
dying there and responsible for the losses that they are suffering in
Iraq. Even though those against the war want the US servicemen not to
be in that country and suffer the casualties that they are suffering
there in the first place. Like the wounded GI's in the veterans
hospital the Bush Administration as well as the US media refuses to
show the returning flag-draped coffins of dead US servicemen coming
back from Iraq as well as Afghanistan, it's just too depressing for the
American public to see were told by them. Even though Michael Moore leaves out the footage of the brutal 9/11
attacks from his movie he does have the very graphic and bloody footage
of the fighting in Iraq. The shocking scenes of dead and wounded US
servicemen and Iraqi civilians and soldiers made many in the theater
watching the movie turn away from the screen. Of all the 535 members in
the US congress only one has a son serving in Iraq. At the end of the movie Michael Moore with a US Marine recruiter by his
side goes to the Capital Building in Washington D.C. trying to get the
sons and daughters of the Congressmen and Senators, who for the most
part support the war in Iraq, to voluntarily go fight and die in the
war that they seem to be so supportive of: to no ones surprise there
were no takers.

As I see it, any documentary, that hits so hard the government has to
release its own documentary to disprove the first, has to be worth
seeing. Yup, a film cleverly titled 'FahrenHype 9/11', supposedly
detailing the lies and false truths told by Moore's film, was released.
When I go to Blockbuster, all 3 copies of this film are frequently
rented out. And 'FahrenHype 9/11'? I've never seen it rented once.Let's face it, we all know there was something up with 9/11, the War
against Terror, and Bush's entire first term in office as a whole.
You'd have to be downright stupid to not see it, or at least in denial.
Moore spills the beans here.Did you know that almost 1 trillion dollars of the U.S. economy is from
Saudi money? Or that the appointed leader of Afganistan was a former
adviser to an oil company owned by a friend of Bush? Or that Bush and
his pals invested in a defense company prior to 9/11? Or how about,
after 9/11, 2 dozen Bin Laden family members were flown out of the
country? Well, now that you *do* know, are you getting a little
suspicious? It's not hard to see what was on Bush's mind during the war. After all,
with several investors to his companies being connected to Bin Laden in
some way, he was in a tough spot. How to conduct war on the man without
PO'ing your buddies, who know the man. Bush thus did what he had to do
to save face, and invade Afganistan. He just did a half-assed job of
it, and went on to invade Iraq for reasons lost in a sea of red-tape
and falsehoods Bush has weaved into the web of lies that make up his
presidency.What sort of amusing and yet, ridiculous things happened here? how
about people beng allowed lighters and matches aboard planes, but a
mother being forced to give up her bottle of breast milk? Or the simple
fact that there's a larger police force in Manhattan than there were
troops in Afganistan.I'll admit it, I was anti-Bush before I saw this. So of course I loved
it. I mean, one Congressman actually says that Congress didn't read the
Patriot Act. What is that? Pass a bill without reading it? And then
using the Patriot Act as an excuse to bust down an old guys door
because he called Bush an asshole? Ha!I will say this now- watch this film. You know what, Moore probably
does tell some half-truths here and there. And like Bush hasn't?
Overall, a great film. And if nothing else, listening to Moore voice
Bush's supposed inner thoughts in the classroom, the morning of
September 11, is very funny."Which one of them...screwed me?"The more pressing question is: Did Bush himself, screw the troops who
gave their lives, fighting a war in a country that posed no threat? Did
he screw the Amercian people, who sent their family members to fight.
Did he screw the innocent civilians of Iraq and Afganistan? Come to
think of it, who did Bush *not* screw?Sadly, the answer is: no one. Bush screwed us all.

Based on the topic and the trailer, I went into this film with great
anticipation for a social commentary and a documentary that would rock
the world. Within the first 10 minutes, however, the film presented
itself as what it truly was: a no-holds barred attack on the President
and his administration. Rather than focusing on the whirlwind created
following 9/11, Moore breaks away to attempt a scary story of a big bad
wolf, which was more of a ad hominem attack than a concise argument of
his point. If Michael Moore wants to make a film about evil, he should
start where he stands and make a film about Hollywood. Then again, he
would not bite the hand that feeds him, especially when he's eating so
well.

It's been about an hour since I left the theater where I saw Fahrenheit
9/11, and the Green Day song "Walking Contradiction" is going through my
head, because that's what the Bush administration is. I'm going to try to
stick to the movie in this review, although I didn't do a good job of that
in my Bowling for Columbine review. I'm not a huge Michael Moore fan. He's
often too extreme and close-minded, but that doesn't mean I wasn't up and
cheering (philosophically speaking) during his controversial Oscar
acceptance speech at the 2003 Oscars. I see his point more times than not,
and often agree with him. If he makes up facts, so what? He conveys them in
a persuasive manner and gets his point across. And, come on-even though the
GOP lies day in and day out, Moore can't make up a few facts without being
publicly scrutinized? Fair and balanced my ass.Fahrenheit 9/11, a play on Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451, is about an
hour and twenty minutes of bashing George W. Bush, half an hour of why the
"war" in Iraq sucks, and then something to tie it all together. I never
liked Bush and never will, and Moore does a good job of running his face in
the mud where it belongs. Moore thinks that he's bringing up some
long-hidden facts about Bush, when they aren't, but like everyone, Bush has
skeletons in the closet, and they're gleeful put out here. There's a few
omittances of facts here and there-such as the real reason why Bush waited
seven minutes to take action after the 9/11 attacks, but still, his face is
priceless! I don't mean to sound hateful towards 9/11, but it shows how much
of a limp fish Bush actually is. I find it hard to believe that people can
defend this clown-well, besides big business. Moore's first few minutes are
about Gore losing the election, and it made me very angry-none of the
political events that occurred from January 20, 2001 until now would not
have occurred if Bush hadn't meddled around in other people's
business.Moore loves drawing up connections, and he does that left and right here.
Some are quite farfetched (it's like he's playing six degrees of the bin
Ladens). He also seems to demonize most Middle-Easterns and the entire bin
Laden family. While they're not perfect (hell, they appear to be pretty evil
in the movie), they're not as bad as black sheep Osama. But that doesn't
nullify the movie in general (see, I'm trying to stay on topic). The movie
is jaw-dropping. Fahrenheit 9/11's a powerful piece of celluloid. Call it a
documentary, call it leftist propaganda, call it what you will, you cannot
deny the absurdity of the American government. It all stems from Moore's
seemingly smaller ego. He pushed his (not all that attractive) mug in every
frame of Bowling, but here he shows restraint and more maturity. You see his
face a scarce few times, and his so-called outrageous stunts are kept to a
necessary minimum. This new type of Moore appears to show more maturity and
is more appealing to the people.I must admit that when the movie switched over to Iraq and the soldiers, it
became a little less interesting. The point was proven, but some of it just
seemed like it was padding for a 2 hour runtime. There is no pleasure
greater than seeing Bush knocked down a peg (he's like a square peg in a
round hole, actually), and Fahrenheit 9/11 fulfilled that need. The whole
movie in general is amazing and a departure from what some people didn't
like in Bowling. This is a dead-on attack of Bush, and if you're voting for
him, you won't like the movie, because you think it's all lies. Hopefully
you'll come around and just realizing you're lying to yourself.My rating: 9/10Rated R for violent and disturbing images and for language.

(which is always sold out) and I felt surprised how it is not propaganda at
all, as its opponents say. Everything in this movie is just showed from the
real. Never Michael Moore suggests some opinions to the audience. We take
our deductions from what we see, not because M.M. says to us what is his
opinion (anyway easy to understand). I grew up in Rome (Italy)watching
American movies. America has always been my dream and my
myth.
I came to live here 8 years ago,I invested here all my money, I love America
and its people.When I started to ask to my American friends how a kind of a
such disastrous and embarrassing president can even hope to be reelected,
somebody asked me: "Why you are so anti American?" . In Italy we are used to
bad politicians since 2,000 years and when I say bad I mean able to
anything. I don't think that a person who don't like a negative bad
president is against the country but in favor of the country. I'm not
democratic and not republican and for sure not communist as I'm a paying
guest, but what this movie says, for me is nothing new. I already have been
listening Mr. Bush to lie about the Weapons of Mass Destruction and all the
rest. I can see everyday that Iraqi people don't feel Americans as
liberators but invaders for oil reason. Anything we have been watching in
this movie we have been already watching on TV, but not focusing it.
Everybody between us have had the occasion to read,before watching this
movie, that the "Halliburton", the company with billions dollars of
interests in Iraq, is owned by the vice president Cheney .Anyway this
documentary is very very interesting as it is able to resume in 2 hours a
good part of the acting of the more powerful man on the planet. I liked
that, with so serious theme, this movie is very often funny and makes you
laughing . A must to see.

Some more objectivity wouldn't had been a bad thing. This documentary
is extremely one sided and is nothing more than an 2 hour Bush-bashing.
I'm not a Bush fan, not at all and I dislike his politics and
personality but it doesn't seem fair that they only showed one side of
this story in this documentary. A documentary should in my opinion be
always objective towards its subject, or else it loses its power and
credibility.I liked "Bowling for Columbine" very much, so I also expected some
great things from this documentary. Although the end result wasn't that
bad, it still disappointed me.The documentary does provide some new good insightful information but
the documentary was really like Oliver Stone's "JFK" at times, it
features lots of conspiracy theories that all don't sound really
implausible but at the same time also are quite far fetched.The documentary is not always told in the right way. It tries to put
too much information in it and handles a bit too many subjects. The
documentary begins with how Bush 'stole the elections' and ends with
the Iraq war. Not everything in the documentary feels really connected.
Also ending the documentary with a mother's grief just didn't feel
right and it was cheap that Michael Moore used this to proof his point.Michael Moore obviously has something personal against Bush and he is
extremely biased with this documentary. I like his style of documentary
making but he didn't handled the subject of this documentary very well.
I'm still interested in seeing his next projects but at the same time
I'm hoping for some more objectivity next time.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

is when he asks the senator if he would be willing to pass along some
pamphlets concerning serving in the military to his daughter. The look
on that "public officials," face captured all of the hypocrisy that
this nation is quickly becoming famous for. Any conservative who never
served himself and would never be willing to let a child of theirs
serve, but has NO problem letting YOUR child serve would have to feel
just a tiny bit de-nutted watching that scene unless they have
absolutely moral character at all. Mike, you hit a home run in that
scene and it's part of what made this movie an instant classic. I am a
teacher and I solemnly promise that I will be showing this film to my
students for years and reminding them of this arrogant administration
and of how fearful and stupid we were as a nation. As a man who served
in the United States Marines, my championing of this film is my
personal kick in the balls to all cons who would sacrifice your child
but never themselves or theirs. Right on, Mike.

I feel that conservatives and liberals alike are looking at FAHRENHEIT
9/11 through the filter of their own agendas: it is not really an
attack on the Republican Party, nor is it really a Democratic
election-year commercial. At heart, the film is an attack on political
powers influenced by big business, which strives to manipulate the
public through fear in order to turn a handsome profit. But this is not
to say that George W. Bush doesn't get a terrific beating here--he
does, and so does his administration, with Ashcroft coming off as
particularly ludicrous. In the first third of the film, Moore goes to
tremendous pains to demonstrate the existence of a "good old boys"
network between the Bush family and Saudi money men, a network Moore
claims facilitated the flight of wealthy Saudis from the United States
in the immediate wake of 9/11. While intriguing, Moore's position on
this point is distinctly interpretive--but there is much more in the
film that is not.In the past, Moore has been accused of startling his targets into
unstudied responses by unexpectedly leaping out at them with camera in
hand, but no such accusation can arise here. In FAHRENHEIT 9/11 Moore
relies upon media coverage of Bush, and while the coverage is edited
for effect there is no dodging the bullet: Bush was where he was, doing
what he was doing, and saying what he was saying of his own free will
and in full knowledge that the cameras were rolling. If Bush emerges
from this looking like a buffoon, he has no one to blame but himself.At this point the film's edge turns razor sharp and deadly. It is very
easy to forget what someone said in an interview or speech several
years ago--but it is also easy to roll the footage and remind us of it,
not to mention pointing out various inconsistencies in the process. But
for all the film's Bush buffoonery, the most chilling aspect of
FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is the portrait it paints of corporate greed and human
tragedy.In parts of the film Moore approaches his subject with a comic edge,
pointing out some of the absurdities arising from the Patriot Act. But
simply put, there are a great many people making a great deal of money
out of the United States' invasion of Iraq. Corporations and investors
rake in big bucks while, as one American solider puts it, an American
trucker driving five miles a day in Iraq makes more in a week than a
solider will make in a month. When one adds to this chilling
observation the fact that the Bush administration has done everything
from cut military pay to seek closure of V.A. hospitals... well, it all
adds up to a fairly poisonous portrait of both business and politics as
usual. Lives are lost, but no matter, at least so long as the polls are
good and the money keeps rolling in.Is the film biased? Without a doubt. Is it speculative? Yes, but only
to a certain degree. Will it make you stop and think? You better
believe it. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer

Michael Moore's fourth film Fahrenheit 9/11 is a classic mixture of
emotions and a truly genius film about the world after the September 11
attacks in 2001. The mixture of file footage and interviews with both
government officials and ordinary citizens shows the mixed feelings
that many people have about the current war in Iraq.The film begins explaining the mistakes made during the election in
2000. It begins with a great big celebration that shows Al Gore and
many other celebrating his Florida victory. Then it goes into a series
of documents, interviews and news footage that shows what George Bush
had done before and after September 11, even a funny look at Bush
teeing off and fishing while on vacation. There are two parts of the movie that work well on hinting on the mix
of emotions most of the people around the world have been feeling since
the war began. The first is footage of Iraqi families and children
living a normal day of flying kites and living normal lives, away from
any fear or trouble from their government. Suddenly, a bomb hits and
obliterates a village.Micheal Moore's film is great and definitely worth seeing to form your
own opinion on it. The film is one sided, yes, but that only helps to
get the main point across. I recommend this film and I feel it is a
great artistic expression about the Iraqi war.

Like one reviewer has said, you feel hood-winked when you watch
Fahrenheit 9/11. It is clearly distorted and deceitful, and is NOT a
documentary. A documentary is something that is true and not misleading
in such an irresponsible manner. See the movie Fahrenhype 9/11 if you
want the truth behind Moore's untrue deception. This movie even
features some of the people that were "used" in Moore's film, without
their knowledge, as they declare such. Their clips were not accurate,
in that they were taken out of context, and many times were submitted
by reporters to Moore and used without their consent. Again, this is
straight from them, just so you know the truth. 0/10 rating. This movie
is awful.

I waited for a long with excitement to see this movie, hoping to see
some truth about 9/11. I have enjoyed Michael Moore movies in the past,
and I especially enjoyed Bowling For Columbine. We need journalists to
question authorities, it's a critical part of democracy. This movie
however, is nothing but anti-Bush propaganda. It's full of
misinformation and straight-out lies. If you decide to watch this
movie, make sure you watch Fahrenhype 9/11 right after. That way you
still have the possibility of making up your own mind, instead of
buying into Michael Moore's propaganda machine. Terrible movie,
terrible journalism, just terrible. Michael Moore - you should be
ashamed of yourself. 0/10

'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a brilliantly edited montage of Bush Jr.'s
questionable appointment to the U.S. presidency, the disaster of 9/11,
Bush's reaction to the disaster, and ultimately a bigger picture of
Jr.'s 'friends' in the U.S. and around the world.This film is slick, even stylish in it's delivery. Many scenes will
leave you wondering, 'Where did he find that piece of film!' The
increased production value of this film gives it a much different feel
from many documentaries. Gone is the newsreel feeling, replaced by
brilliant stock and original footage that call out for one's undivided
attention. Unlike other works in this genre, 'Fahrenheit' is more than
the dull drudgery of facts and stats. It both enlightens and entertains
while pressing it's point.As for subject matter, Fahrenheit 9/11 will certainly be more divisive
than other Michael Moore works. The reason? It aims straight for the
heart and takes no prisoners. The only shades of gray will be those in
the dim theater, certainly not on screen or in the dialogue. The film
is most certainly biased and unbalanced, but if that's what you're
after, this is the wrong place for you. This film represents opinion, but opinion that is worth hearing
nonetheless.See it and judge for yourself. I must mention that 'Fahrenheit' has
been widely discussed and attended here in Canada, as it will most
likely be in the same manner around the world.We'll all be watching this November!10/10

Right up front I'll make my positions clear.This film is clearly a personal grudge fight, in addition to a cry for
national sanity in an insane situation.Re. Michael Moore; I loved ROGER AND ME, and was less, but still
moderately impressed with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. I'm made a bit uneasy
by Moore's style of "ambush journalism". Roger Smith had it coming, and
the tactic (the only one possible in dealing with him) showed his true
shallowness, arrogance, greed and cunning. However, Moore came off as a
bit of a bully versus Charleton Heston when using the same tactics;
that interview showed a frail old man who came to a battle of wits
while hopelessly and totally unarmed... an ironic posture for the
spokesperson of the NRA. Re. George W. Bush; I didn't vote for him and I was utterly disgusted
by the fraudulent election of 2000, wherein The Supremes circumvented
the electoral process and installed a Caesar by fiat. Mr. Bush is
clearly intellectually unequipped to handle the job and too ethically
challenged to be trusted in office. Once he was actually in power and
SOME of his policies were exposed for all to see, my attitude changed
somewhat. I felt (and still feel) that the old Roman penalty for
corrupt public officials should be immediately applied, but with a
slight modification; Bush should be tied and sewn into a sack with a
half dozen or so rabid weasels, and the sack tossed into a fast flowing
river with plenty of rocks.That having been said...I resisted the powerful urge to see this film on the opening weekend;
long waiting lines and crowds are tiresome (I had my fill of that in
the service), and I don't have the patience to deal with a hoard of
clueless Yuppies and the collection of Bush supporter protesters in
front of the theater that had been promised by local groups. I
therefore waited until a noon showing on Monday... surely the crowds
and brouhaha would have slacked off by then.Imagine my surprise when, arriving early, I drove into a crammed
parking lot, and found myself in a waiting line anyway... at NOON on a
workday!As for the film itself... I expected no huge surprises from it's
content, and I didn't get any. Moore has produced a solid, workmanlike
documentary. It expressed the maker's Point of View (as any other
documentary does), and presented the facts of the situation at hand
clearly and pointedly.What struck me even more than the film was the audience there to watch
it.In the period between taking my seat and the start of the showing, I
noticed something very odd... something I've never seen in a movie
theater before.Headed up the aisle to choose a seat... an elderly man with a walker.
Then, another... and a third. Now, one with a cane. Next, assisted by a
Lady (apparently his wife), a man struggling up the aisle pulling an
oxygen cylinder on a small cart to feed a nasal cannula. Then a
relatively young woman struggled up the aisle with a cast on her leg
and crutches... and finally, installed at the head of an entrance aisle
by an usher, was a man in a wheelchair.That's when the importance of this film struck me full force.For these people, going to a movie theater is a major hassle, an
expedition that requires logistical support, planning, and a whole lot
of effort. Despite all of that, these people obviously felt that THIS
film was WORTH the effort. After the fight to get this film
distributed, these people were NOT going to let it pass them by.During the showing... there were few demonstrations or catcalls; this
audience was intently watching and listening. As the credits came up,
there was applause... not a roaring ovation; it was scattered and in
some cases tentative... but applause nonetheless.When I was leaving the auditorium I was deeply disturbed and made
uncomfortable by what I'd just seen and heard, both on the screen and
in the audience... and for the 2:15 showing, there was ANOTHER long
line waiting to get in.Maybe the long lines and crowds are saying something that Mr. Bush
should be paying attention to.This administration has held pitifully few press conferences, and
they've seen no need for openness with their constituency. Instead,
they've tried every way they can to close off information sources and
manipulate the media. That policy is what made the huge crowds for
FAHRENHEIT 9/11... people DO care about their country and it's actions,
and they'll get ANY information about it they can find, and get it
anywhere they can.

I had the afternoon to kill, so thought I'd watch "Fahrenheit 9/11"Phrases like, "learn to edit!", "steaming manure pile!", "a real clock
watcher!" come to mind.The movie loosely focuses on the ilks of the Bush administration. Okay
that wouldn't be bad, but about 15 minutes into the film, it starts to
loose co-hesion, and really starts not to make any sense at all. It
becomes somewhat of a diatribe. And we all know what that is!
(Constipation of the brain, resulting in diarrhea of the mouth).This "mock-u-mentary" suffers from glaring waste of time scenes,
interviews, etc. Out of 2 hours of film, 30 minutes is what I would
consider, usable information.This movie will have you screaming: "Make it stop! Oh please! Make it
stop!" A real snoozer/loser." Don't waste your time with this "excess
baggage!"Rated no stars.Wayno

8/10I watched "Fahrenheit 9/11" at the New York public premiere late last
night in the early hours of Wednesday, June 23rd, the first opportunity
for anyone not connected with Hollywood or the media to see this film.
I say this so that you take prior reviews (particularly those
dismissing the film outright) with a hefty dose of skepticism. I am
also a Marine Corps veteran of Operation Desert Storm, and thus am
acutely aware of the realities of war and its intended use only as a
last resort when all alternate options are exhausted.I've seen all three of Michael Moore's films; "Roger & Me", "Bowling
for Columbine", and now 'Fahrenheit.' Of the three, this current film
has a far more disciplined approach. There is generally far less music,
grandstanding, and general joking-around. While perhaps disappointing
to his long-time audience of liberal partisans (myself among them),
this more even-handed approach is truly welcome, because it instills
the documentary with a sense of reason and perspective that will appeal
to independents and perhaps even conservatives. Moore's audience here
is not his long-time left-wing choir; it is the millions of Americans
who trusted a President to be one thing and who has turned out to be
quite another indeed.The major newspaper reviewers justifiably point to the first 20 minutes
and the last 20 minutes, about Bush's Saudi links and the carnage in
Iraq, as the strongest segments. Indeed, the sequence where a series of
minority representatives are gaveled to silence in the Congress is
shocking in the extreme. Yet the film is fascinating throughout; it is
sometimes inchoate and contradictory, but it constantly encourages and
demands critical thinking. This is perhaps the real target of Moore's
fury; the unaccepting, unthinking acceptance of authority figures and
'leaders' who have not earned that respect. He uses Britney Spears to
make this point with devastating finality and grim hilarity. He asks,
indirectly, which side are you on-that of unquestioning obedience to a
betrayer of the nation's best interests, or the side of truth,
criticism, and transparency. It will be hard for Bush supporters to
muster the energy to defend their addled puppet after Moore's calmly
launched but devastating salvos. Furthermore, it asks the American
public to take responsibility for sending its children (mostly middle-
and working-class) into harm's way for less than convincing reasons.
The deaths of our servicemembers are the price we pay for this
president's leadership, and Moore demands that the viewer analyze this
war with a eye to its true costs and motives.I am sad that there are so many in this country who will refuse to see
this film for head- in-the-sand political reasons. Moore lets Bush and
his cabal do most of the talking, and as such lets them indict
themselves far more effectively than Al Franken or Howard Dean ever
could. The film makes an absolute mockery of this president, and it is
*richly* deserved. It is likely that this effort will finally 'screw to
the sticking place' the courage of a national media that has shamefully
aided and abetted this belligerent and bumbling national disgrace.All this being said, this is not a depressing film, at least not for
me. Many of the images and themes are certainly profoundly
discomfiting, yet the very existence of this film (in nationwide
release) is a testament to the endurance and beauty of the American
system. This country has tolerated and then dismissed other scoundrels
and crooks, and soon enough this current pack of liars and cranks will
be added to the dustbin of history. You can thank Moore for his courage
and true understanding of our freedoms, rights, and responsibilities
that you have the opportunity to see this film and form your own
judgment. Do that. Its high time for all Americans to become
responsibly informed, and to consider anew the true ideals of American
democracy and freedom which have lately become so distorted.Election day is November 2nd. That's the most important review of all.

Not being an American citizen' and trying to look at this documentary
objectively its hard to believe that so many u.s. citizens voted for
the Bush administration. Apart from the fact that this guy is a
complete idiot, did people not learn anything from George Bush SNR? did
people really believe jnr would be somehow the total opposite of daddy'
who was a warmongering, moneymaking pirate, who was friends with the
very family that allegedly killed thousands of Americans. I find this
totally beyond logic and this is what Michael Moore,s documentary is
about' regardless of the hundreds of other questions the the American
people didn't get answered by the 9/11 commission, how can a country
the boasts to have the best intel services on the planet miss something
this important, never mind the attacks and subsequent invasions, there
has to be more questions answered about the c.i.a. and f.b.i and any
other sevices that lets a tyrant rule their country.

The assertions made in this film are ridicules and based on such flimsy
and non-existent evidence that one either be entirely overcome with
paranoia, political bias, an ounce of marijuana, or most likely all
three. I don't like Bush either but this film makes those opposed to
Bush look hysterical. The history books may one day use this film as
evidence of democrat mass delusion! This film is a huge discredit to liberal ideology. If I did not know
better, I would think that Michael Moore is a closet republican trying
to discredit liberalism or the democratic party. Mr. Moore, next time, make a film that is fair and well researched.
Come up with something that will appeal to open minded thinkers.

I've found that the way to appreciate a Moore documentary is not to
judge it by how closely it reflects truth but, instead, by how
successful it is as a catalyst for discussion. In that respect, this is
a fine film.Moore unmistakably pushes his own agenda in this film, which was his
attempt to persuade voters to oust Bush from office in the
then-upcoming election. Of course, he was unsuccessful in that regard
and must have felt doubly devastated since he sacrificed Oscar
eligibility in order to televise the film.While this film bends and omits facts I don't think that it was as
egregious an offender as "Bowling for Columbine". There were plenty of
unpleasant facts already in the public consciousness, so I suppose that
Moore didn't feel the need to invent situations of his own. That being
said, there are of course some cheap tactics like approaching
politicians to get them send their kids off to war. At least that's in
support of a valid point; that the 'haves' are quite content to let the
'have nots' die in order to uphold the country's supposed freedom.Probably the most laughable point put forward by Moore was the quote
from George Orwell's "1984". He's spent the entire film attacking the
Bush administration for ineptitude and a flimsily justified war and
then compares them to the unstoppable power of 'Big Brother'? Give me a
break.On the whole, I do think that the film is fairly well done from a
technical standpoint though not nearly as artistically rendered as
"Bowling for Columbine". With that in mind, I recommend the film with
this caveat: Don't just mindlessly swallow what you're presented with
like the anti-intellectuals of Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451".

Moore inspires extreme emotions in people. The comments on this board
are testament to that. Even the most incoherent gibberish gets dozens
of useful votes as long as it takes a swipe at Moore.Watching this movie now, with Iraq still in chaos, the sub-prime
fallout pushing world economies into recession, Al Gore an Academy
Award and Nobel Prize winner, and Bush as lame duck as Presidents come,
it is hard not to think, "What if...?" Criticism of Moore for lack of
journalistic ethics or not adhering to certain documentary conventions
is disingenuous - the man is a self-confessed polemicist, looking to
add left-wing bias to counterweight what he sees as the overwhelming
right-wing bias in the establishment media. Yes, he left out the UK in
his Coalition of the Willing sequence, but did you need to be told the
UK was on board? Having said that, you do wonder if Moore's antics make
it all too easy for his critics to dismiss him. Trying to get
Congressmen to sign up their children for service in Iraq raised a
titter, but it is hardly hard-hitting discourse - and it does provide
an easy target for your enemies. Why did no Senator support the
African-Americans from the House of Representatives in their protest?
Was the involvement of the Bush family in the Florida election
completely above board? These are valid questions that still need to be
answered. The same people who condemn Saddam for election fraud will
turn around and claim it is disrespectful to the office of the
president to even consider the possibility of vote-rigging in Florida.
They prefer to deflect their attention to Moore's burgeoning waistline
and bank balance. If Moore really wants to create change, maybe he has
to think about toning down his showboating and letting the arguments
take centre stage.Is this all ancient history? Bush won a second election fair and
square, so who cares how he won the first one, right? It's all Barrack
and Hilary now, who even mentions Dubya these days? I'm not so sure. I
think Moore has posed questions that people will return to. Bush may
never face trial, but history will continue to judge him, and Moore has
gone some way to setting the agenda for that process. The skill of
Fahrenheit 9/11 is not in the evidence it presents, but in the
arguments it sets out to create. Love it or loathe it, you can't ignore
it.Ted Heath, commenting on the decline of British politics, noted that
opposing politicians in the British parliament used to say, "I disagree
with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say
it." At some point during the last 30 years, that mindset changed to,
"How dare you say that!" Depressingly, the brouhaha caused by
Fahrenheit 9/11 would suggest that shift is now a universal trend.

You had expected much and you get much, but not as much as you got from
"Bowling for Colombine". The first hour goes fast here but the narration is
also a little too fast. You are told about liasions between Saudi Arabia and
the Bush family. Maybe there is such a thing, maybe there isn't, but you
have no time to tell, because of the speed of the telling.The second hour is better, where you meet real people or the back-bone of
the US. This has always been Michael Moore's best work and this is really
tough stuff against the Bush administration, fair or not.Moore wants us to believe that the Iraqi war is about Big Business wanting
more money. The Marxist analysis comes at the end, telling us that what it's
all about, is the conserving of society's structures. Even if you're not
into socialism, it's refreshing to hear. And it's obviously also commercial,
so why not? Everyone should be satisfied.

Michael Moore's new movie goes where no white house politician in their
right mind would dare go - it, despite Moore's now infamous disregard
towards Bush's politics, tries to show the best possible "truth" behind
America's political agenda in the last 3 years and makes some pretty good
points along the way. Bush is interpreted as America's no. 1 liar and you
have to give Moore credit for digging up the stuff he does. But something
else happened while I was watching "Fahrenheit", something very peculiar.
Somewhere along the way I actually started feeling admiration towards Bush
himself, he was no longer the dumb and fumbling president of the most
powerful country in the world, underneath this carefully and meticulously
presented mask he was a darn good genuine rotten businessman that had
everyone thinking just the opposite. Boy did we all underestimate him, he
was the worlds most powerful money-making machine that used September 11th
and other scandals to fill pockets for all of his friends and relatives all
along. For not making the vast majority of the world realize this soon
enough I salute him, he sure did his homework on deceiving people as far as
behind-the-scenes happening was concerned. Moore eventually feels like a
highly liberal savior that has a lot of strings to pull as long as we're
talking about disgracing president Bush, yet he seems powerless when
attempting to "persuade" congressmen to sign their sons and daughters into
the army or when the reality line is pulled. His truth about the mishap of
9.11. is highly watchable and persuasive from a democrat's perspective, yet
now we the people are smart enough not to see nor only black nor only white.
It's always the gray that makes the strongest impact. Yet this one does
shift  much more into the area of the people that now mourn over the loss of
soldiers, sent into harms way for a cause that wasn't all that necessary to
begin with. 
A well made documentary that I predict is going to be remembered as a
groundbreaking achievement of campaign persuasion. Unintentional, of course!

SPOILER (but not really)Even if you agree with him (as I mostly do) Moore makes propaganda
films, not straight documentaries. He has become a master at using
(opponents would say "misusing") a complete panoply of film technics to
drive home his points and urge his audiences to action. These include
very selective editing of interviews and news clips; mechanical
juxtaposition of images to manufacture the "truth" of a person or event
(often to ridicule); commentative music (often to ridicule); and many
moore (sic). Non-fiction film can be usefully divided into five
categories: Entertainment (like travel films and reality TV),
Information (traditional documentary), Instruction (how-to films),
Aesthetic experiences (like films of the avant-garde from the 20s &
30s), and Propaganda (like Riefenstahl, Vertov and others). Obviously
these can intermix in any one work. A useful analogy to print media:
Moore makes editorials, as opposed to news stories.

I watched this movie together with another critical viewer and we both -
while aware of Moore's tactics and aware of most of the facts beforehand -
could not help but shake our heads in disbelief most part through the
"documentation". It's simply unbelievable. Is this what you get when you
educate a nation via television? The problems lie deeper and Moore fails to
touch those since he does not have an answer. However, he does have passion
for his cause and he speaks his mind, one would think.I can see how Disney did not want to distribute this documentary, still by
their attempts to stop this they just helped Moore push it even more.   
Make of that what you will, but it really is one documentary no one should
miss. I gather Moore goes to some lengths to provide facts on his web site
to further prove his "case", a case that concerns all Americans and all
world citizens alike.There are of course a lot of Moore typical elements that downgrade this
documentary to a soap style, slow moving, propaganda piece, but the moments
play with the spectator emotionally and as such can be justified, only that
it does not have the desired effect if you as spectator can detach yourself
from these scenes, which you should. A documentary should be objective, fact
driven and not play with emotions. But then again, Moore is rather emotional
when it comes to Bush and Fahrenheit 9/11 shows that at
times.Highly recommendable.

Hard to comprehend that this man has been the leader of the free world
for nearly 4 years now, a miracle we are all still here really. I think
the scene depicting the reaction of Bush to the 9/11 attacks whilst
sitting in a school is says it all.That said everyone who watches this film should take it with a pinch of
salt as some of the material is misleading at best and Moore at times
rams his point home with little regard for the facts, and i find his
links between the Saudi Royal family and Bin Laden tenuous at best (not
to say that the Saudis aren't evil in their own special way).This is a movie everyone should watch.

Much of the debate about this film seems related not to the film
itself, but to its politics. I really get the impression that a lot of
the people who are so against it haven't yet bothered to see it, or at
least weren't able to set aside their blinkers when they did. Scroll
down and notice how many of the critical reviews don't mention anything
specific about the film, instead attacking Michael Moore's politics and
left-wing politics in general. Let's have some facts, not just petty
name-calling.And yes, I know Michael Moore doesn't always have the best track record
for promoting the 'facts'. But therein lies the key observation about
this film: it's not a documentary, it's clearly, obviously and honestly
a political polemic. Michael Moore's purpose in this film is not to put
across a 'balanced perspective'- he's trying to make a point. It's not
a debate, it's an argument, and a very powerful one at that.Then again, the main weakness of this film is that he never seems to
decide exactly what his 'point' is, beyond 'we shouldn't have invaded
Iraq'. Is he saying that Bush is an incompetent, lazy moron, or is he
saying that he's a conniving weasel who schemed to send his country
into an unjust war? There are also several periods where the film seems
to drag (particularly the section from Sept 11 to the start of the Iraq
War).While some have disputed this film's 'facts', it makes some
observations far more clearly than I've ever seen in a mainstream US
film before. Is it healthy, for example, for the leaders of a country
to have such extensive ties with some of the biggest companies in that
country, and indeed with leaders of a foreign power? Is it healthy for
someone to become President mainly because his father was (the reverse
observation of this is why is it so hard for someone from an 'ordinary'
person to get anywhere near the top- see biographies of Margaret
Thatcher or John Major for how 'ordinary' people can make it in
class-ridden Britain, and ask yourself why that doesn't happen in the
'land of the free')? Why did we hear very little about the
representatives' challenge to Bush's election? Why did so many people
believe the falsehoods about WMDs? And finally, what kind of indecisive fool sits there reading a
children's book with a stunned mullet look on his face when he's just
been informed that two planes have crashed into the World Trade Centre?
A President's job is to make decisions. That was NOT what I call
'strong, decisive leadership'. Even if Michael Moore does show it a
little out of context, any half decent politician would have been right
out that door. I know this for a fact because I have seen it happen in
other (much more minor) situations. Why not this time?All these ideas are covered in the film. It's a powerful, powerful
film- where the audience rollercoasters from laughter to tears to
outright anger. Even if you don't agree with Moore's politics, try to
keep your eyes open and consider the facts objectively. It's really
quite disturbing.

I wouldn't complain so much about Michael Moore if 1) he wasn't so crummy to
people who don't deserve it (I don't mind when he picks on the head of GM or
Charlton Heston), and 2) if he didn't have the disturbing ability to insert
himself into touching private moments that don't need Michael Moore's
presence.Happily, both of these tendencies are mostly absent from Fahrenheit 9/11.
Republicans and Democrats take it on the chin, but the "average Americans"
are offered up without condescension, a rarity in the past for Moore. (He
does get a few cheap shots at small countries like Costa Rica and Iceland,
though.)As for my second point above, it might be useful to compare two scenes. In
Bowling for Columbine, we get a scene where Moore comforts a woman on
camera. The woman needs comforting; Moore is there; he comforts her. But
there's something smarmy about the event ... it's not clear why we have to
see Moore with his arm around the woman, except to point out that Michael
Moore cares. In Fahrenheit 9/11, however, there are several emotional
scenes, particularly those with the woman whose son was killed in Iraq.
Moore remains mostly off-camera for those scenes ... he lets us see the
woman's grief, it's powerful and important to what Moore is trying to say,
but he leaves it be, he doesn't insert himself for no reason.As usual, Spinsanity takes on Moore's cavalier attitude towards facts, and
there's plenty to kvetch about, but even here, Moore is improving. As
Spinsanity notes, the film "appears to be free of the silly and obvious
errors that have plagued Moore's past work." They do go on to note that the
movie "is filled with a series of deceptive half-truths and carefully
phrased insinuations that Moore does not adequately back up," but to be
honest, that doesn't bother me much ... I have no objection to Moore the
rabblerouser, editing his footage for maximum impact, I just don't like it
when he lies. And there would appear to be very few lies in Fahrenheit
9/11.I'd have to say there's some irony in the fact that Fahrenheit 9/11 is
Moore's most successful film at the box office, and also the least
"entertaining." Perhaps Moore should have been trusting his audience all
along to get his arguments, without the cheap stuff. Eight on a scale of
ten.

I saw this polemic (not documentary) at a house full preview in Sydney.
The movie is particularly interesting to Australians because we were
foundation members of the 'coalition of the willing' and our elections
are also due in a few months.The first half of Fahrenheit 9/11 is a mixed bag: some worrying but
unproven insinuations of inappropriate liaisons in high places, a few
laughs and even some boring moments. Hardly deserving of the Palme
d'Or. But the final 30 minutes are a powerful indictment of war, not
just the war in Iraq. There are scenes of mangled bodies (too graphic
for TV) and the wailing of mothers on both sides of the conflict. I
found the scene where recruiting officers chatted up unemployed youths
in malls of poor neighborhoods particularly poignant (Does this really
happen?). Moore uses these scenes and, most tellingly, the words of
George Orwell (from the novel, 1984) to expound his thesis  the
victims of war are largely the patriotic poor who fight to preserve the
privileges of the rich and powerful. This is a powerful and disturbing
message that is hard to refute. 9/10.

I can't really describe in words what I have in mind right now after seeing
this beautiful documentary by Michael Moore. I find it very brave for a
filmmaker to go and do such a good job in a documentary that might cost them
their own life in a country that claims having freedom above all. I also
find it great how Moore manages and expresses his own point of view, while
others criticize him for having one. I guess many people cannot handle the
truth especially now days. Many of those who criticize this filmmaker's
point of view should consider thinking about this movie with an open mind.
Just focus on the subject and forget how much you agree or disagree with
Moore. How about this film as a documentary? Is it good? Is it bad? So how
bad is it? Actually I might disagree about some of the points raised by this
movie but that's deep inside my head and it was meant to be raised. You're
free to think. It's actually much better if we do think. And to tell you the
truth, my life was shocked few hours ago and this shock still affecting
me.Ignoring the technical details in my review for now and focusing on the
emotional side I got. This documentary kept me interested minute by minute
and second by second. I loved the way music was used. I also noticed
something else about me there in the dark room (cinema theatre that is), and
what I noticed was being touched as a human much more than focusing on the
technical stuff as an amateur movie critic. I guess the beauty about
Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) is that it was meant to make us think, feel, raise
questions, and mostly know (or get closer to) the truth in a positive way
that might change your life.Sometimes it is political and sometimes comic. It's even sentimental few
times, but thought provoking after all and trying to stay as close to the
absolute real truth as possible. Reminded me of Oliver Stone's daring,
brave, great masterpiece that is JFK (1991) in many ways. I note here that
both of them had great masterwork of editing using materials which we all
surely saw on TV here or there and it involves conspiracy
too.In short: Important piece of work that needs to be seen by everybody
(despite what MPAA says).10/10

As a fan of Michael Moore's work, and an ardent anti-George W. Bush
American, I was obviously looking forward to seeing what Moore had to offer
us in `Fahrenheit 911', a film which gives an overview of the 2000 election
and war with Iraq.  Moore's first two documentaries, `Roger and Me' and `The
Big One' largely went under the radar because the `enemy' was essentially
Big Business.  `Bowling for Columbine' turned him into more of a national
figure because he took on a more controversial subject  and therefore
everything he did was viewed with higher scrutiny.  `Fahrenheit 911' was
proving to be ultra-controversial before it even hit theaters, so based on
past criticisms I had heard of his work, and my own reservations, I have to
admit that I went into this film with some trepidation.I think with F911, Moore relied more on letting the footage hold its own,
which was an overall wise move on his part, based on the subject matter. 
There are some moments where I knew that there was editing done, but I don't
consider that to be duplicitous, or even highly relevant  what I found
refreshing was that the most crucial moments were allowed to speak for
themselves, with sometimes frightening and sickening results.  (Bush's `7
Minutes' after finding out about the WTC literally made me sick to my
stomach)  By largely staying away from the spotlight, Moore was able to keep
the viewer's eyes on minds on the subject matter, and this was a wise
decision.  Bush looked inept all on his own, without any help from Moore.F911, however, is not a perfect film by any means.  The information and
images provided enraged me, but the film was fairly unfocused and therefore
I didn't know what to train my rage on.  The film started strong, with some
lighthearted touches (playing `Vacation' by the Go-Gos while illustrating
how long Bush was on vacation during his first months in office was
absolutely hilarious) but once we hit the war, Moore showed us some really
disturbing imagery and gave the audience some pretty scary figures, except I
was still raging over the first act of the film, so I had to
compartmentalize my anger and move on.  I also was a bit confused over the
business transactions between the U.S. and the Arabs; either I was not
getting it or it needed to be mapped out a more straightforward manner.  I
certainly got the gist of it, but all of the links seemed to get blurred a
bit.  One of the most highly criticized moments of the film, (Moore showing
the children of Iraq playing in the streets, etc. before the U.S. bombed)
failed to raise a flag for me, however.  For anyone who has read Howard
Zinn's `A People's History of the United States' there are several ways of
telling a story, from all perspectives while still being
factual.While its success is not surprising, the magnitude of its success is.  I saw
this film on opening night in suburban Wisconsin, and the late showing I
attended was packed.  When the film ended there were whistles, clapping and
cheers, and I have heard similar tales from around the country.  I'm not so
sure that the film is so much superior filmmaking as it is compelling
subject matter, but the mix of the two make `Fahrenheit 911' an important
film.--Shelly

The film is a breathtakingly dramatic and revealing exposé into some of the
factors and motives which led to the invasion of Iraq, and the consiquences
of them.The film is heavily biased against George W. Bush and his administration,
but I see that as a positive rather than a negative. They deserve all of it
and more. As such however, you won't get the full truth from watching this
movie alone, what you will get is the less told side of the story.The filmmakers are guilty of sensationalism, editing for dramatic effect,
and presenting facts, opinions and evidence which support their own
arguments and opinions in a more favourable light than those that don't.
Were they not to do so however, I know I would have been a lot less
interested and compelled by it, and it would not have had as much of an
impact, both emotional and intellectual, as it did on me.One could easily dismiss the conclusions drawn from such a film on these
grounds, but to do so would be missing the point. What's being sold here is
basically the truth.Osama Bin Laden was not caught.
There were no WMD.
Iraq posed no threat.
American corporations, some of which are run or owned by the Bush family and
the president's staff, stand to make billions in profit as a direct result
of the invasion.Bush, his associates and the media companies they own and control are
broadcasting their messages 24/7, do yourself and your mind a favour, and
take a couple of hours to hear Moore's.

I don't know if this is a model he can follow in the future, but I hope
he can.As a rule, his work is insightful and obstreperous, but undermines his
intent by his insistence in being on camera more than he needs to and
by being self-righteous at times. In Fahrenheit 9/11, he's on screen
minimally, and he lets the real subjects speak for themselves, whether
they are people he approves of (some U.S. soldiers in Iraq, some Iraqi
citizens, some parents of U.S. soldiers) or people of whom he
disapproves (many of the individuals in the George Bush Junior
administration). By letting each speak to make their point, the points
are stronger.This film works better than The Big One or Roger & Me, though they are
original and worthwhile work themselves. I hope Moore makes more films
like this, staying behind the camera and letting the facts speak for
themselves in front.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is unmistakably a Michael Moore documentary being very
similar in style to Bowling for Columbine. The first half of the movie
covers Bush's election and the early period of his Presidency and the second
half deals with Iraq. It finishes with a wonderful reading from Orwell's
"1984". The movie delivers a strong anti-Bush and anti-war message.This movie won't change your opinion if you're already anti-war or pro-war.
And you won't learn anything new if you get your news off the Net rather
than traditional media. But if you're unsure about the war and you use
newspapers and TV for your news then this movie will blow you away. That's
who Moore is trying to get at. And he will -- if they see this
film.This documentary is exceptionally well made. It's factual (if selective with
its facts), fast paced, emotional, engaging and challenging - exactly what a
documentary should be. The media's reaction to this movie and the
exceptional number of very low ratings on IMDB (from people who - I presume
- have not seen this film) sort of proves Moore's point about the one-sided,
intolerant nature of modern America.Highly recommended.

I think you can appreciate Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 best by thinking
of it as a political cartoon rather than as a documentary or, as Michael
Moore himself suggests, an op-ed piece. You don't look for objectivity in a political cartoon. You don't even look
for truth. You expect to see the cartoonist's opinion. You expect his
opinion to be expressed in extreme hyperbole. The images in a political
cartoon are caricatures. They are easily recognizable, but they are not
intended to be accurate depictions. So, this is what Fahrenheit 9/11 is: it's a political cartoon, and a very
well done one.

Just brought my brother (not normally knowledgeable or interested in
the US) to see F911, and he loved it. The cinema was packed too.One thing they could have done is explain all the major players a bit
better - I had to point out who Rummy, Ridge, Cheney, Powell, Dracul-
sorry Wolfowitz, Daschle, Rice etc all were at the start. But I concede
that most people going to watch this will already have some knowledge
of the subject matter. But still...It's splendidly put together too. The guy knows how to put together
docutainment...Seems more to do with differences between the haves and the have-nots
(or the haves and the have-mores, as Bush says....) than any perceived
differences between dems and reps. I loved the recruiting Marines.
Those guys were slick....The supposed gaping holes in your coastlines were covered. I refuse to
believe that bit is true though. It couldn't be.There were several times that my eyes tended to sort of fill up....it
was quite emotional in places.Obviously the WTC attack, which was tastefully portrayed (unlike some
recent Bush ads), but also the wailing Iraqi lady, and of course Ms.
Lipscombe. When she was getting hassle in front of the White House from
some crazy Ann Coulter wannabe who questioned whether she'd lost a son
at all, you couldn't not get mad.I can see why someone at Fox New said it was a brilliant piece of work,
quite frankly. It's not anti American in any way. It shows soldiers in
bad light in some places and pawns in others. Sounds about right.If you're conservative, I can understand you not wanting to see this.
It should have you quaking in your boots...If this movie causes a swing as small as a single percentage point,
that might make all the difference.I along with Michael, will have my stubby fat little fingers crossed...Besides, I've got £20 riding on the result, and I've never gambled in
my life.

I can only say what I feel in just a few words.Michael Moore as a Politician:
- I want to beat the tar out of the man.Michael Moore as a Filmmaker:
- Surprisingly, I have a lot of repsect for his abilities as a filmmaker.
When I was buying the ticket for this film, I had a feeling that it was just
going to make me hate him even more, but I went in knowing that it was going
to be biased and one-sided, which it was. But he has a dry sense of humor
and sarcasm that matches mine and I couldn't help but enjoy
myself.DISCLAIMER:
If you are a registered American voter, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT let this
film affect how you vote. Any schmuck can go out with a camera and film a
person in his daily life and edit the film to make him look like a fool.
This film is so biased it is scary. DO NOT BASE YOUR VOTE ON
THIS.9/10.

I saw this movie last night, and found it extraordinarily moving and
upsetting.  Much of Moore's "case" is not new, but some of it definitely
was.  Agree or disagree with the man, he knows how to tell a story, and the
footage he obtains is simply amazing.  I cried at several points in the
story, literally dumbfounded.  The theater was full, even on a Tuesday
night.There are those who dismiss this film, without having even seen it.  To them
I say, see it.  The images speak for themselves.  You don't need Moore's
commentary to get the point, in fact, the only flaw in the movie is Moore's
talking when being silent would have been the better choice.

For the most part I truly enjoy Michael Moore's coyly sarcastic
voice-overs and use of silly music and pop songs to spin his web of
opinions about politics and war, but as a documentary film-maker he
serves the viewers best when he shuts up and lets those being
documented speak for themselves. The segments featuring the patriotic
mother from Flint, Michigan grieving over her son's death as a soldier
in Iraq are some of the most raw and powerful scenes in any film I have
ever seen. And the most damning sequences are when Moore allows George
W. Bush and his cohorts to be themselves. No voice-over or commentary
is needed. The ignorance and arrogance is overtly apparent. Blazingly one-sided, this is brilliant propaganda film-making by Moore.
Unfortunately as a film and documentary I don't think this is a good as
his previous effort, "Bowling for Columbine." With that film at least
he accomplished something tangible (i.e. getting K-Mart to stop selling
a particular type of ammunition). The only thing apparent here is the
controversy he drums up. There are some inspired moments, like when he
attempts to get members of Congress to enlist their sons and daughters
in the military to help fight the war in Iraq or when he drives around
Capital Hill with a bull-horn reciting the Patriot Act. But most of it
seems like taunting, and Moore is too well known now to get away with
some of the things he used to get away with years before. Again, the
film works best when it shows raw footage of Iraqis and American
soldiers at the forefront of the theater of war and then juxtaposes
them with scenes of rich Saudi Arabians and Bush and his friends far
away from the strife. Like usual, Moore preaches to the converted. He
puts together pieces of a puzzle most liberals already had a pretty
good notion of. I just hope this film incites the liberals as much as
it does the other side, so that we might finally stand up for our
liberal ideals and take back this country. War is hell, and so is
political discourse.

Reading the reviews on here for F911 is like watching religions people
trying to deny the existence of evolution just because science has not fond
every bone. Like them, they expect Moore to have all the answers and to dig
up every fact before he presents his argument. Well As far as evolution is
concerned its like a puzzle, when enough of the pieces are in place you can
see that it's a cat, or a house or whatever. You still keep working on the
puzzle but even though all the pieces are not in place, you already know
what it is.What Moore is doing in F911 is looking at the bigger picture, he may have
gotten some of the tiny and nearly insignificant details wrong, but the
overall impression of what is really going on in (your) country is clear. I
saw the Chris Hitchens interview on Dennis Miller last night before I saw
F911, and I can say that Hitchens lied. I can even quote his
lie.June 28/04 Hitchens said on Dennis Miller that Iraq had never threatened a
US life, when in fact the movie clearly states that 'Iraq never Killed a
single US citizen'. The actual movie says nothing about Iraq's threatening
the US, which Hitchens went on to use as a contradiction in the movie when
GWB says "Oh ya and he tried to kill my dad". I went to the movie looking
for that exact quote spouted by Hitchens, and to my shock it was not in the
movie at all!Hitchens Lied. For what reason I do not know, but its amazing to me that
someone as smart as him would go on national TV and lie, knowing he is lying
and knowing he'll be caught.I'm not a huge Michael Moore fan but I saw F911 with eyes open, after
reading all the movie reviews and hate reviews like the ones here on IMDB
and I have to say that I was not impressed with those arguments. They spend
all their time IGNORING the big stuff in the movie and they try and draw
attention to the few minor facts that are slightly off from what they
profess to be true. Even if the stuff they claim is wrong in the movie is
actually wrong, it does not change the picture painted by the film. I am not
impressed with their argument, they totally failed to contradict the large
issues in the movie and failed to sway me from the feeling that something
huge and awful is going on in (your) country and as a result, the world as
well.Anyone who would support Bush at this point is like a religious person who
see's the Virgin Mary in a tree stump, and nothing on earth can convince
them otherwise.-Lobo

I've seen every Michael Moore release (including "Pets or Meat" and all
of the "TV Nation" run), and based on the hype, the many critical
reviews, and the picayunish nitpicking, but most of all based on my
experience in watching his films before, I fully expected a lot of the
sophomoric Michael Moore to be on display in F 9/11. I still keep going
back to seeing his films, of course, because the guy's got a huge heart
for his hometown and his people, and whether you agree with his
viewpoints or not, that affection for his folk and country comes
across. But I didn't have high expectations as far as subtlety and
narrative coherence when I entered the theater tonight.I was amazed to see in F 9/11 a mature, coherent, simplified, and dare
I say it -- subtle?!? film. Quentin Tarantino wasn't blowing smoke when
he stated the awarding of the Palme D'ors had nothing to do with
politics. This is an extremely accomplished film, both technically, and
in capturing the zeitgeist of an extremely trying time.What's especially encouraging about the way the film is put together is
that Moore seems to have gone to see some Erol Morris, Ken Burns, and
maybe even a bit of Sam Fuller. The film is not like previous Michael
Moore movies, where there's a lot of turning on the camera and letting
Moore say and do things we sort of wish we could and in the end often
wish Moore hadn't, after all. (Some of the more forced moments in "The
Big One", making poor PR flacks squirm, or the Charlton Heston ambush
in "Bowling for Columbine" come to mind.) Rather, there's an extremely
forceful and clear arc -- a story! -- that's told, and the story
itself, even if one knows all the constituent parts, speaks in the end.The Morris is evident in that he largely lets the subjects of his film
speak for themselves, whether it's members of the administration, the
soldiers in the field, greedy war industry profiteers, the Saudi
ambassador, or random passersby spinning their own media conspiracy
theories about the Peace Protest Lady in Lafayette park (she, I can
assure you, was not a set piece: I've seen her myself. Lila Lipscomb
certainly was no set-up.)The Burns is evident in that he's done an admirable job at taking
complex relationships of facts and not burrowing into excruciating
detail. Critics of the film who have taken on every nuance are treating
this not as a movie, but as if it was some kind of guest appearance on
Crossfire or an attempt to write a scholarly book. You wouldn't look to
Ken Burns for a scholarly recap of every detail of every battle of the
Civil War. So while the facts and video are laid out often without
bulky connective tissue, and occasionally with motives imputed, this is
not done with a sledgehammer any more than Ken Burns came right out and
said the South was doomed because slavery was evil. In both cases the
choices of the filmmaker in how to present his subject make the
argument much more forcefully. And, I might add, Moore's adopted some
of Burns' framing techniques for interviews, although his old
man-on-the- street style is also evident.The Sam Fuller evident in the film is the use of the raw truth of the
picture to tell the story. The rather arty use of reaction shots of
ordinary people during 9/11 itself and the even artier pictures of
paper billowing in smoke are positively symbolic but utterly true to
the real event. Where the punches aren't pulled is in showing the true
brutality of the war -- not just to the Iraqis, or to the victims of
the terrorists and resistance fighters being dragged through the
street, but the corrosive effect on our own troops, their suffering in
the field, their uncertain recovery at home. It's frighteningly brutal
to see some of the footage of an actual IED attack on our troops and
the evacuation of our wounded, and raw footage of Iraqi victims of
stray fire. It's even more gut-wrenching when you realize: I haven't
seen this before. Where was the media for this? There's plenty of the Moore trademarks, including some video inserts
and ironic background music and wry commentary. But for once they seem
to be done largely to propel his theme along, not just to be smartass
for smartassness' sake.What grabs one most intensely about this film is the focus on our
troops in the latter half. Moore draws a careful arc, using his
hometown, to show how recruitment is done, why young people will join
as a way out but also out of the best motives and from the best
families - "the backbone of our country" as the mother of Michael
Pedersen, Lila Lipscomb, puts it, and what happens when they get to
Iraq. It almost has the effect of following a single person from high
school to a body bag, even though there are dozens of separate scenes
in the development of the theme.And finally having learned from some other filmmakers at long last,
Moore injects the best parts of himself into the last part of this
movie. It's that sympathy, understanding, and love of his place of
origin and the people who struggle every day there that allows Moore to
be able to comment on the ultimate price we're paying for this war with
utter genuineness and a complete lack of ironic hipsterism. I think
it's entirely possible that one might disagree with the rationale for
the war that Moore alleges, the distraction from our real enemies, and
quibble with the things he leaves out. But regardless of one's politics
vis a vis Moore, the final third of the movie is a tale with resonance
not just for any patriot, but for anyone asking others to fight and die
on their behalf. What you get in the last 20 minutes of the film simply
can't be missed. I can't imagine you could not hear the story of the
Lipscomb/Pedersen family and be moved by the truest and most noble
patriotism.I believe that the critics of this film may have been annoyed by the
obvious challenge to that very notion -- what does it mean to be
patriotic? and the way that Moore decides to connect the dots in the
end. Of course he attributes venal motives where mere incompetence or
blind arrogance might be a better explanation. But it's not over the
top; it's a crafted message, one that cuts home to the ultimate
question of personal responsibility.Filmmakers have to make choices, and Moore finally seems to have mostly
made the right choices. He injects himself in the film a few times, and
twice for his celebrated stunts, but that's it. The rest of the film is
just an attempt to make sense out of a seemingly uncontrollable
situation with seemingly irredeemably tragedy.What else do you want from a documentary? It's not a textbook, it's a
film. And a good one.To my own surprise, I'm giving this film an 8/10.

Anyone who gave this movie a one is not being honest and anyone who
rates this movie a ten has rose colored glasses. And neither side
discusses the merits and drawbacks of the film. Like most Micheal
Moore's works his ability to frame the shot on the fly is unparalleled.
He can in a moment see where he needs to be, get the shot he wants, and
make the point he wants to make. Correction his victim makes the point
for him. This film had an added dimension of a slick intro... the
montage of makeup being applied to the members of the administration.
this showed a level of sophistication that has been missing in Moore's
previous work. Now for the negatives. This film was OBVIOUSLY rushed to
the studio. It desperately needed one or two more trips to the editing
room where some unnecessary fluff needs to hit the ground. The movie
went from hard hitting documentary to a barely undulating mass of goo.
OK OK you want an example... the inner city shots trying to equate the
inner city to Iraq. I KNOW what he is trying to say but for one thing
he doesn't convey it properly and secondly it has no place in the flow
of THIS FILM. If Moore wanted a film that dies of natural causes come
November ... this is it... if he was actually shooting a documentary
that will be seen in classrooms 10 years from now... it needs a lot of
editing.

I can't say I liked this movie. I'm a fan of Michael Moore - I think
his film Bowling for Columbine is the most amazing, touching, well-done
documentary I've ever seen. But this was lacking something for me.
Maybe because I feel as if he was very biased to the liberal side, much
more so than I expected. He uses all this crappy heart-wrenching music
during sad parts that made me think of CBS news. UGH. I didn't fall for
that, but a lot of people there did I'm sure.My theater was full of rich white people, which because I live in the
DC Metro area, isn't very surprising. I even had to stand in line to
see it! I haven't had to stand in line to see a movie since Star Wars.
And I was even seeing this on a Monday night (both theaters sold out)!
So I was expecting to be blown away, and most of the audience was blown
away I think. There was cheering and clapping at the end of the film,
but I feel like all those liberal richies were just there so they would
have something to talk about at tea tomorrow. Since I've been in the
military, it was more a painful movie for me. When I saw the scenes
with the guys with the blown off limbs doing rehab at Walter Reed, I
thought about my patients at Bethesda Naval. It's a sad, sad thing war.
Moore does capture that feeling and makes sure he gives props to the
troops and he does show the reality of being there in Iraq.And when you
see Dick Cheney's former company and the Bush family making a huge
fortune from the war, it makes you sick. Yet I felt manipulated in this
movie, like I was really not getting a complete picture. I am a
democrat, I won't vote for Bush, but this movie didn't decide that for
me. See it if you want, but don't let it decide your vote!

Although, I dislike the Bush administration immensely, I didn't think this
was the most brilliant film ever.  It's a good film (not completely
brilliant or deep, and sometimes disingenuous, but good). Michael Moore tugs
on the heartstrings nicely. He represents his point of view and conveys
information in a sensational-enough way that it actually wakes some people
from their brain-dead slumber.  Apparently it takes a sledge-hammer to wake
many people up.Facts are overstated and skewed (such as the implication that many of the
Bin Laden relatives are encouraging Osama to commit terrorist acts against
the US).  He implies a number of things that aren't completely
factual--often deceptively and manipulatively.  At the same time, most of
the "hard facts" he reports in the movie are taken from public sources such
as government reports, newspapers, and investigative journalists.  Things
such as the amount that the Bushes make from their Saudi oil connections vs.
the presidential pay are well documented. The movie is a mixture of
exaggerated implications along with well-established facts. It can be a
frustrating mixture since the sometimes misleading implications and
character assassination will probably make some people doubt even the
well-established facts. It becomes difficult for viewers to sort things out
for themselves if they haven't been diligent in following the news for the
past three years from an in-depth source.  Hint: 30 minute newscasts with 8
minutes of ads are NOT in-depth (especially with all those dippy
human-interest stories, along with sports and weather taking up half of
those 22 minutes).Ultimately, the movie's problems are also its strengths at the box office.
It's often simplistic, misleading and sensational, but demands attention
through its insistence, humor, and shock value. Moore has correctly figured
out that many people won't pay attention unless they're given something
shocking, big and outrageous. He delivers something that is a product of its
times and meets people on their level: simplified, entertaining,
manipulative, emotional, gripping and incendiary.  I don't like the "dumbing
down" aspects of the movie--but it's really nothing new.  Fox News and Rush
Limbaugh have been using these exact same techniques for years.  For
instance, people such as Rush Limbaugh did things such as implying that Bill
Clinton had one of his friends killed when it was well-established that the
friend committed suicide because of intense pressures and depression. Some
of the attacks on Bush are similarly unfounded and speculative. Moore has
figured out the antics of the conservative propaganda machine and beat them
at their own game.  He's fighting fire with fire. It's unfortunate that many
of these tactics aren't always particularly honest, are divisive, and
encourage emotion, rhetoric, and speculation more than rational thought or
responsibility.Perhaps for me the thing this movie does best is to summarize the very
troubling aspects of the Bush administration for those who weren't bothering
to pay any attention. Even despite the bias (or maybe because of it), this
movie will probably wake some people up who were too busy rallying around
the flag to pay any attention to what was actually happening. Even with the
bias, Fahrenheit 9/11 will stir up issues and ensure that they're talked
about rather than swept under the rug. Maybe this movie will even have a
part in being sure that government and big business are held responsible for
their acts or deception and irresponsibility if even some of the allegations
it makes are shown to be true.

Excellent work by Moore who manages to stay behind the camera most of the
time and occasionally lets footage role without his often-disingenuous
everyman indignation.  Compared to Columbine, it's not so smug and the
gotchas seem less cruel.Bush totally deserves what this movie does to him.I was a little impressed that Moore did treat that poor mother's grief with
some dignity.  When she's set upon by a smug protestor in front of the White
House who is trying to appropriate the death of her son into a critique of
the war, the real loss vs. someone's opinion about policy is terrible to
see.

Well I just saw F911.First off I'd like to reply to a comment I read earlier. The person states
"If you want to be informed watch CNN, FOX NEWS or better yet
PBS".LOL! Fox news?? Weren't they the news station that came in 1st in a study
looking to find which -- out of all news agencies in the world were the most
misinformed??? CNN is the American version Aljezzera. PBS is a good choice
along with the CBC (90% of the time) and BBC for fairness.Any way.... Good and Bad. (SPOILERS)Bad.
-Michael Moore's vision of a Pre-Iraq. Sorry Mike I know your trying to show
that they were better off before the war, but Saddam is a bad man and has
done allot of bad things to his own people in the past. Mike you could have
still shown those images with images of what Saddam and his regime has done
to them and your point of a useless Iraq war would still get across.- When listing the countries in the coalition of the willing Moore missed
England, Australia, Portugal, Japan, Italy, Spain and a fewother significant countries. Stuff like this gives ammo to those who put
down your films. But Moore's point about Afghanistan in the coalition was
dead on. Again the point of the film would not have been lost if you listed
those other countries. - In the film Moore displays the US military as a bully with Iraqi
civilians. They can be seen that way at times, but can you blame them? The
soldiers believe they're there to liberate a suppressed country, but yet are
attacked by civilians in car bombs at check points. I would be aggressive
to. But in FAIRNESS to Moore he does show that the men and women of the US
army are human and do have feelings about what's going on and they are not
monsters. Good.
- The rest of the film. Go watch it. For some Americans certain things will come as a surprise and completely
unbelievable, where the rest of the world already knew all of it. You'll
hear some comments from the people on the right say that the connections
with BUSHs and the Bin Laden family means nothing. Chaney has nothing to do
with Halliburton any more. Moore makes Bush look worse than Osama bin Laden
and all the facts in the film are lies.Complete BULL****. I'm happy this film was made. Ever since November 2001 I
always wondered why Americans were not outraged at the Bush administration
when no American citizen was allowed to fly home after 911 but the Bin Laden
family was given the green light with out questions. CNN and FOX could not
care less. Not one mentioned it, I watched for. It took this film to make it
a popular question. The movie is filled with other stuff like the above. Go watch it, look up
your own info and make up your own mind about the Bush Administration, don't
let the movie be your only source. I totally recommend this film.

While I went into the theater initially agreeing with Mr. Moore's point of
view, his movie made me understand clearly why everybody hates
liberals.While more than thirty minutes of the movie were dedicated to childish
name-calling, describing why everyone in Europe, America, and the Bush
Administration is stupid, the majority of the film attempted to be a
touching and sincere. This, however, was made difficult by Moore's constantly-sarcastic narration,
Kubrickian music selections, and hypocrisy (such as the making fun of the
the troops during one segment, and then the total support of them in the
next.)Moore claims that George Bush used the media to create an ever-present fear
in America by exploiting Americans' ignorance. This, of course, is true, but
when Moore uses similar tactics to woo his audience, he looks no better than
Bush. I was personally offended that, when Moore discussed how the "willing
coalition" of other countries had no armies, he used a clip from a certain
famous film (Nosferatu, 1922, Germany) to make fun of ... Romania? Banking
on the fact that few Americans would know the history of this film, Moore
used a very famous movie for a cheap laugh ... something that his movie
seems to be arguing against.Moore declined to mention or include the valid arguments against war made by
the UN, especially Germany and France. Although, had he included them, he
probably would have included xenophobic comments about those countries as
well.The film, though discussing history, was very one sided, and any true
historian knows that in order to prove one side superior, one must show why
the other side is wrong. Moore did not achieve that, and I was left feeling
that his "opinionated piece" was nothing more than a temper-tantrum to get
back at those who did not appreciate his Oscar speech.6/10.

A slightly less subjective documentary from Michael Moore finds the
filmmaker's totally justifiable rage at Bush II being vented. Moore
decided to back off on this one and let the subject speak for itself,
although some of his own narration I think weakens the effort. The
blaring gaffes of the Bush administration do not need any accompaniment
to be utterly shocking. Nothing in the film was so "un-American" that
it couldn't have been said in the pages of the New York Times, from the
disillusionment of the troops in Iraq to the incestuous
Halliburton-Cheney relationship. Moore does not overtly extrapolate the
problems presented into any kind of class analysis, which I believe is
absolutely essential in any critique of the oppression and exploitation
which is exemplified here. However, there are a few guarded attempts to
recognize the class issue, as when Moore stops back in his hometown and
lets the oppressed, subordinated, and underprivileged people in Flint,
Michigan question the rationale of fighting a war in Iraq when there is
a very real war being waged on the poor of the United States. Also,
there was the very powerful statement by a corporal who declared he
would rather face prison time than to go back to Iraq to "kill more
poor people." In this statement, all debate about the war is
reasonably, succinctly settled.

Actually, I tend to like documentaries. But I've never gone to see one in a
theater until Farenheit 9/11.It made me laugh; it made me angry. But it also made me shake my head a bit
with its liberal use of cheap shots, (pardon the pun). It was a bit too
preachy, and it is clearly a movie that the bleeding hearts can rally
around, especially those who continue to believe the poor black folk are
still being trodden upon.Still, I liked it overall. It made a comment that needed to be made. And it
made it quite effectively. After seeing this film, I don't know how anyone
could vote to re-elect Bush. I voted for him in 2000; I won't make that
mistake again.Micahel Moore knows how to get his points across. He uses humor, biting
satire, and dramatic sequences. The worst part about the movie for me was
that it had far too much maudlin footage of crying mothers who had lost a
son in Iraq. Yeah, I know it's sad to have to bury a son or daughter, but I
don't need to pay good money to sit in a seat at the theater and watch some
lady bellow on and on about it.That said, I would highly recommend watching this film. It's a documentary
everyone should see. I gave it an 8.

Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is a cinematic bullet aimed at the
administration of George W. Bush, and at the heart of the war in Iraq.
By turns acidly funny, shocking and heart-wrenching, Moore's two hour
op/ed piece challenges the legitimacy and qualifications of Bush, as
well as the legitimacy and motivations behind America's most divisive
conflict since Vietnam.Moore has an obvious agenda and vivid viewpoint. This movie is not a
'fair and balanced' look at its subject matter, and never claims to be.
Its point is made as clearly as if it were shouted through a bullhorn:
George W. Bush, a president of uncertain ability and dubious ties, led
the United States into an unnecessary war against a foe that posed no
real threat. 'Why did he do this?' the film asks. 'Why do the family
and business associates of those in power benefit the most, financially
and in terms of influence, from their connections to this struggle? How
have these links been used to further a pro-war agenda? Who is being
protected from public scrutiny and why? What dark secrets lie behind
the administration's public face of clear-eyed resolve?'All these questions, and many more, are addressed in Moore's trademark
style, mixing sarcastic smart aleck, zany comedian, clever
investigator, muckraking gadfly, insightful humanist, and intense
political firebrand.There are few new accusations here. Most of these same points have been
raised separately and in lesser combination many times before on
television, in the nation's op/ed pages, in political think-tank
analyzes, in dozens of books on all sides of the debate, and in the
digital halls of the Internet. But never before has one side of the
debate brought so much of the evidence together into such a ferocious
and powerful statement of purpose.'People of America,' the clear subtext shouts, 'you've been had! Ray
Charles could have seen the underlying truth! You've been manipulated
into supporting a war based on lies, half-truths and political
expedience, with a generous helping of greed slathered on top!'The movie features hilarity and screwy humor aplenty (witness the
montage of Bush taking off the entire month of August 2001: golfing,
fishing, playing with his dog, barbecuing, and boating, all set to the
backing track of The Go-Gos 'Vacation'). But there is also a deep and
abiding anger, directed mostly at those who walk the highest halls of
power. Knowing that it does not portray itself as journalistically
objective reportage helps one keep perspective on the film strengths
and shortcomings.Whatever those are, no one who sees this film will soon forget Lila
Lipscomb. A working-class mother from a strongly military Michigan
family, her son Ben is sent to Iraq as a Black Hawk helicopter crewman.
She speaks to Moore in her kitchen about the worry of her eldest child
being in such distant, hostile place, and how she 'always hated'
anti-war protesters. This self-described 'conservative Democrat' tells
of her patriotism and pride as she hangs the American flag on the front
of her house (careful not to let it touch the ground), as she's done
every day since her daughter served in Iraq during the first Gulf War.
She talks movingly about the economic and social ills of such blighted
towns as Flint, Michigan, where she runs an employment assistance
center for the disadvantaged.But Lila's worried loyalty to her country is transformed to
disenchanted, confused pain when she is informed that her son has died
in an attack on his helicopter. Surrounded by her solemn family, she
heart-breakingly recounts receiving the fateful phone call from the
Army, and its terrible aftermath. She breaks down in sobs as she reads
Ben's final letter home, received a week before his death. Her sorrow
unearths questions that had before lain hidden, and she is driven by a
need to understand why her son died, and on what altar he was
sacrificed.Lila makes a pilgrimage to Washington to stand before the White House,
the place where the decisions were made that led to her loss. As she
speaks to a lone protester with a display of Iraq war images, a woman
rushes into the frame. 'This is all staged,' she repeats with
skepticism and ill-concealed contempt. Lila tells the woman that her
son was killed in Iraq and the woman, unbelieving, challenges her.
'Where was he killed?' she asks. 'Where was he killed?' In a voice
shaking with grief and suppressed fury, Lila answers 'In Karbala. On
April 2nd.' The intruder simply stares, recognizing Lila's heartache,
struck speechless by her passion and sincerity. The moment transcends
the film's agenda, the terrible human cost to the families of the
fallen eloquently overshadowing our national debate on Iraq.This window on a mother's mourning provides Fahrenheit 9/11's most
compelling and poignant scenes. Lila Lipscomb's grief is gut-wrenching
and her pain transfixes the heart. It lends the film undeniable tragic
weight.Other sections are less successful. Much of Moore's tracing of links
between President Bush's family, the terrorist-tolerating Saudi royals,
and the bin Laden family comes off as a dry recitation of obscure
connections and suspicious conjecture. While many of his uncomfortable
questions deserve better answers than we've previously gotten, Moore
consistently suggests a 'worst-case scenario' point of view. Perhaps
some of the ties he makes are mere coincidence and happenstance, but
realistically, can they all be?Moore sarcastically lists the 'Coalition of the Willing,' countries
that supported our Iraq invasion, with hilariously appropriate film
snippets ('Romania' is accompanied by a grainy shot of Nosferatu rising
from his coffin; 'The Netherlands' rates footage of a young man taking
a huge hit of dope; 'Iceland' is backed by the black and white images
of Viking reavers). But the list tellingly omits Great Britain, Italy
and Spain. He obviously thought including them would lend the coalition
more legitimacy than he is willing to give it.Moore wisely stays off camera for the greatest part of the film,
allowing his images, culled news footage, and cleverly chosen backing
music to do much of the speaking for him. The grandstanding antics of
his previous work are kept to a bare minimum here, and are all the more
effective because of this. Armed with military recruiting brochures and
enlistment forms, he stops Congressmen on the street, trying to get
them to sign their own children up to serve in Iraq (according to
Moore, only one of the hundreds of Congressional children are stationed
there). One listens to him cordially while he makes his pitch; others
either ignore him or actually flee. None of them sign the forms.
Another gimmick finds him driving an ice cream truck around the
legislature, reading the text of the Patriot Act through a loudspeaker.
Representatives admit on camera that the labyrinthine bill was
hurriedly proposed in the middle of the night and was voted in with
little debate the next day, before most had the opportunity to actually
read it. Many later regret their lockstep acceptance. This throws a
stark spotlight on the old adage 'Legislate in haste, repent at
leisure.'Moore engages in cheap shots at the expense of our leaders, some all
the more effective because they are only partially unfair. Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz looks particularly Gollum-like
spit-combing his hair into place prior to a television appearance.
Vice-president Cheney is portrayed as a zealot unconcerned with
inconvenient facts. National Security Adviser Rice comes off as an
intellectually dishonest apologist for the president's policies. John
Ashcroft is painted as a political failure, rescued from deserved
obscurity (after having lost a US Senate reelection bid to a dead man)
when Bush appointed him as Attorney General.But the brunt of the ridicule is saved for the president himself. Bush
goofily mugs at off-screen colleagues just seconds before announcing
our invasion of Iraq to the nation. He painfully stumbles through
extemporaneous remarks to the public. On a golf course, he speaks to
the press about weighty matters, and then clashingly switches gears,
telling them all 'Now watch this drive.' He gets all of the ball, but
his good old boy hominess belies the seriousness of the subject matter.The president has made numerous ill-considered statements about Iraq,
and Moore lets few of them go quietly. Bush, speaking to a very
well-heeled crowd, calls them 'the haves and the have-mores. Some would
call you the elite,' he smirks, 'I like to call you my base.' In the
face of contrary evidence, he repeatedly ties Iraq to al Qaeda in
speech after speech (to the effect that, in August of 2003, a full 70%
of those polled falsely believed that Iraq was behind the September
11th attacks). He unwisely jokes on camera that running the country
would be much easier if America were a dictatorship. In addresses to
military personnel, Bush touts their courage and the nation's gratitude
for their service, all the while (as Moore cannily points out)
proposing cuts in their hazard pay, family assistance and veterans'
services.Michael Moore's stated intent with Fahrenheit 9/11 is to affect the
outcome of the presidential election in November. Whether he has
succeeded remains to be seen, but in the meantime, he will have at
least sparked further debate, inspired more pointed questions, and
touched the souls of all but the most hardened. He may even, with this
potent juggernaut, have changed some fence-sitting minds.There will be many who disagree with this movie and want it suppressed
(the right-wing group Move America Forward has organized massive
letter-writing campaigns and protests to discourage theaters from
showing it; the White House Communications director ironically stated
'This is a film that doesn't require us to actually view it to know
it's filled with factual inaccuracies.') Those Americans with
less-pressing responsibilities will be well-advised to see Fahrenheit
9/11. Regardless of political leanings, it has much meaningful content
to be considered.All the vitriol (and there is plenty to go around) aside, this is an
important film that cannot simply be ignored and dismissed out of hand.
Cut off from the social and political turmoil this war has spawned, it
would not be nearly as effective (which is why this film is unlikely to
age well as a cinematic work). But falling as it does at the very
height of the Iraq war's increasingly polarized and decreasingly civil
debate, it strikes with the power of lightning. And, as they leave the
theater, it resonates like thunder in the hearts and minds of the
audience. What filmmaker could ask for more?

Michael Moore's film exploits the media, the government and the
American citizen. He makes no effort to hide his agenda. Michael Moore
is a raving liberal, and has made millions of dollars by being a loud,
obnoxious, in-your-face bully. I have been, and always will be, a
registered Republican... who just happened to be an absentee voter from
Palm Beach County, Florida during the 2000 Presidential Election... and
I felt compelled to drag myself to see Fahrenheit 9/11 opening weekend
simply to enjoy the frenzy of political and emotional citizens, be it
Democrat or Republican, stuck in a room together for a running time of
2 hours. I consider myself to be open minded, but opinionated when it
comes to the current "State of the Nation." This movie is POWERFUL.
This movie is THOUGHT PROVOKING. This movie is GRAPHIC, SHOCKING, and
BLATANT. When the credits rolled at the end, and some audience members
were giving their standing ovation (some because they loved it, some
because it was finally over), I realized my hands were clammy and
shaking, and I felt nauseous. I had been so intently watching the
explosion of information that I had become physically affected by it. I have no personal agenda in writing these comments, but I would like
to suggest to each and every American... even if you HATE everything
about politics and what they stand for... please go see this film. This
movie is going to change the future of our country, and it's important
to be educated about what is going on with our leaders, citizens,
allies and enemies. Michael Moore is out to make a point, so he
presents information from his perspective. He is a biased and highly
skilled at "double-speak." He knows how to manipulate information to
try and trick his audience. He may even assume that the average viewer
is uninformed, and wants them to agree with him in the end. I'm smart
enough to know that... so I was able to view it from a relatively
unbiased point of view. There are some very important TRUTHS to SOME of the content of this
film. I noticed that any segment WITHOUT a voice over (narration) was
extremely interesting and eye opening, even genuine. Moore works
closely with a Michigan woman who's son was sent to Iraq. As the film
progresses, this woman's life is torn to pieces, and she changes her
tune. She began by being pro-war, pro-government, pro-welfare,
pro-everything... and ends up crying hysterically at the gates of the
White House because she is over come with grief about the senseless
death of her first born son, when his Black Hawk chopper was shot down
in Iraq. These are the moments that redeem this film. For every biased
comment Moore makes... he does allow people to speak on their own. He
uses quick editing to get his point across... and takes MANY things out
of context. He even tries to convince the audience that every U.S.
solider in Iraq is an ignorant, pre-pubscent, psychopathic murderer.
So, if you can handle an intense viewing experience, I'd advise you to
go ahead, watch the movie, give Moore his paycheck, but please make up
your mind on your own. Debate it with your friends and family, do
whatever you need to, but please make a decision based on how you feel
afterwards. If it shakes you, then tell some one. If you love it, tell
some one. Get the word out... because this is how American citizens can
make a difference. Get involved, and cast your vote in the upcoming
2004 Presidential Election.

The artistic value of this film has been acclaimed by the judges at
Cannes and elsewhere, though I have read at least one commentary
challenging the factual accuracy of the film. Even Moore says "It's
just a movie." But a thought provoking film it is.Anyone willing to view the film with an open mind, regardless of his or
her political leanings, cannot help but ask some serious questions.
Given the plethora of books about the Bush administration, including a
few from folks formerly part of the administration, we should all be
asking some serious questions. Moore does so poignantly.The words of a wounded soldier who is switching his registration from
Republican to Democrat because of the Iraq war. The tears of an Iraqi
woman at the loss of family and friends. And the testimony of a
patriotic Mom in Flint, Michigan, who lost her son in Iraq must touch
even the hardest of hearts. The fact that the right has sought to
prohibit to movie's release says something about its power.One may or may not respond to Moore in his grizzled beard and baseball
cap, but there are enough questions raised that one at minimum will
hopefully seek answers.Artistically, Moore does some marvelous things. For example, in his
story of the tragedy of 9/11, the screen goes blank and we hear only
the sounds of the tragedy. His focus of the President sitting reading
about a goat after having been informed of the attacks in New York as
the clock ticks is engaging.Few films that I have attended have generated applause at the end--even
some of the greats like Star Wars movies. But this one did. And the
difficulty getting tickets on opening night was a real surprise, as
were the hordes of young people at the movie. This is, in my view, a
movie for our time, and might net Moore another Oscar nomination for a
documentary.

I consider myself a political independent. I think its pathetic and
narrow minded when people lean too far to either side, and anyone who
gave this film a 10 or a 1 is probably an extremest. That being said, I felt this movie deserved an 8. The facts cant be
denied, however I believe the conclusion is a bit far fetched. I do not
approve of most of the decisions that the Bush administration had made,
however, I don't think that they are evil people. I believe they were
doing what they thought was right, but made tremendously bad decisions
in the process. Does that excuse them for the damage they have caused?
No, and in my opinion, it would be dangerous to re-elect someone who
has made such obvious and disastrous mistakes. Whatever you believe, don't discount or embrace this film 100%. Do your
own research and form your own opinions, don't simply follow the party
line.

Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, there are two scenes
that need to be seen in this film. No one need go further than the
scene of the Iraqi woman cursing the U.S. after her uncle's house is
destroyed to understand the depth of hatred that many in the Arab world
hold toward the U.S. No one need go further than Mrs. Lipscomb's grief
to understand the evil of war. Even if you're very conservative, isn't
it a fair question to ask why so many of us are wondering why we
haven't seen these scenes before?To dismiss this film as mindless propaganda has and will be done, as we
can see in many reviews here. Moore makes a characteristic mistake when
he depicts a carefree Iraq prior to the war. Mournful, tragic music
accompanies the electoral house proceedings - there is no real attempt
at objectivity here or in many other scenes in this movie. At times
Moore definitely risks getting ponderous, as in his statement that
abuse perpetrated on Iraqi prisoners is a direct result of the
immorality of Bush's administration.Let's face it, there are a lot of people out there who feel the same
Britney Spears. They will not be fazed by Moore's film. But be it marketing forces, mere curiosity, or some kind of mass
psychological wish fulfillment on the part of a bunch of liberals, this
movie's success at the box office is a good sign. It shows interest in
an alternative opinion, suggests people are interested in politics. I
feel it does raise valid questions that Bush can't ignore. As I walked out of the theater in predominantly Republican Utah and saw
the long line of people I was grateful that we live in a country where
divergent opinions can still be heard. Those who would silence Michael
Moore or brand him a traitor and betrayer of "American values" should
be ashamed of themselves.

Everyone should see this film regardless of political affiliation. 
Heartbreaking, poignant, funny, enlightening...what can I say?  Many of the
scenes were shocking, and I'm not talking about just the war scenes either. Thank you to all the people who made and/or appeared in this movie.
Especially Lila.  As a mom myself, I ache with grief for
you.There is no courage without sacrifice, there is no sacrifice without pain. That is my sentiment to all who appeared in this film, including and
especially to Lila, her son, and Michael Moore, and all the people affected
by war *wherever* you live.  Peace.

I have been a fan of Moore's for years now and every time he makes a new
film I am floored.  Just blown away with what he reveals to the audience. 
If you go into this movie expecting the lightheartedness of his past
features then you are mistaken.  Although there are the occasional comic
relief bits, this film is just gripping and emotional and heartbreaking.  It
is completely different from all his others since he doesn't put himself out
in front of the camera too often like in "The Big One" or "Roger and Me". 
Take your friends and tell everyone you know about this movie because it is
a must see for every American.  Not everyone will agree with what he says
and what he reveals, but they should not argue it's points without watching
the film first.

I don't believe in God. But if I'm wrong, and there IS a God, then I can say
with confidence that "Fahrenheit 9/11" is the reason that He invented
movies.Even if you disagree with Michael Moore, and adore Bush, you still have to
admit that this is an emotionally powerful and stirring
film.As both a film student and a disabled veteran of the war in Iraq, this movie
was very close to my heart.I urge everyone in America to go see this movie right now. And I do mean
right now. What are you doing this exact second? Well, drop it and go see

"Fahrenheit 9/11" raises an important question:  can a documentary be
nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award and its director for Best
Director?  Yes, it is that good.  Politics aside, the film is funny,
inventive, touching, maddening, and always engrossing throughout its two
hour length.  For anyone who avoids documentaries because they are boring,
here is a documentary that is anything but.  The editing is sharp, and the
scene selections on target with Moore's admitted point of view.  Unlike
"Roger and Me" and "Bowling for Columbine," Moore himself stays offscreen
most of the time.  He only appears in a few sequences and, in this case,
less Moore is more.  He also wisely does not show the 9/11 attack and lets
the sounds, which are played over a black screen, evoke each individual
viewer's memories of that day.  His clever use of old TV clips, especially
an homage to "Bonanza," are well done.  Talking heads are kept to a minimum
as Moore lets video clips of actual speeches, interviews, and events speak
for themselves.Although the film has a definite political purpose and agenda, it is
nevertheless a powerful, well made, and important documentary in its own
right and should also be critiqued as such.  As a personal aside, I believe
that the IMDb rating system has been debased by members who voted on this
movie without having seen it.  Why are the votes all skewed to "1's" and
"10's?"  Why were there more than 2,000 votes when the film was only playing
in two theaters in New York City?  This movie would make an excellent double bill with "1984," preferably the
Richard Burton/John Hurt version.  Moore reads several lines from the Orwell
classic towards the end of the film, which make Orwell seem to have been a
better prophet than Nostradamus.  Viewer's do not have to buy everything set
forth in "Fahrenheit 9/11," but they certainly have a right to see it and
judge for themselves.  One would hope that those who have opposing views
will produce an equally fine film to present their side of events.  The only
question is "Can they?"Perhaps, as with "The Fog of War," the DVD version of "Fahrenheit 9/11" will
have hours of footage that were not included in the theatrical version. 
What is set forth on screen just whets the appetite to know more about what
has been going on in our country while we have all been sleeping.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a very interesting film, but that interest comes more
from the subject matter than the treatment of it or the effectiveness of the
film as a documentary.  Many interesting facts and pieces of footage are
presented, but the film doesn't really pull them together or do anything
with them.  This affects the first half of the film mostly, where we are
given a list of tenuous connections and expected to draw "guilt by
association" from them.  Well, association is not proof of guilt, and
although it undoubtedly *is* significant that, e.g. members of Bush's family
played some role in the Florida vote-counting, the film doesn't offer us any
proof that this led to a false result.  Similarly, the fact that prominent
Saudis invested heavily in Bush's oil business is probably very significant,
but Moore doesn't give us any real conclusions or details other than an
intimation that maybe we should be suspicious.The film improves significantly when it shifts focus to the post-Iraq
invasion, and the most effective footage in the film is undoubtedly that
from Iraq.  It presents a very different impression of America's role and
the results there than anything you've seen on the news.  It leaves little
room for doubt that the invasion of Iraq was a stupid mistake at best, a
cynical crime at worst (and most likely).  This is hardly news, however, and
should have been apparent to anyone that gave the matter fair consideration
from well before the first bomb was dropped there.Perhaps that's why the film ultimately failed to deliver for me - that Bush
is an idiot and a liar and that the administration took us to war in Iraq
for the profit of themselves and their rich friends is something that has
been patently obvious for a long time, and I was hoping Moore's documentary
would go much deeper than it does into how the situation came about.  By
focussing on Bush he may achieve his immediate objective (get Bush out of
power), but he barely touches on the roots of the problem that need much
deeper investigation.  Namely, how does somebody like Bush get to the
position where he's nominated for president?  How is it that every 4 years
the American people are presented with a choice between two super-rich
people with a network of connections to big businesses and other special
interest groups and little to no evidence that the good of 99% of the
American people features anywhere in their plans?  How is that Americans
accept this, cast their votes one way or the other and believe the system is
so great that every other country in the world must be inferior and should
follow their lead?Democracy is a good system when it means that the people of a country get to
decide their own fate, but democracy as practised in the US is far from this
system.  We have votes, but the choices we get to vote on are carefully
manipulated by the unscrupulous super-rich folks who want to make sure that
whoever's allocating our tax dollars is doing it in their interests, but
there's enough of a facade there to let people believe that we're "free" and
the country is looking after us.  We're no more free than the people with
Iraq were before Bush decided for us that it was time to "liberate" them
(and their oil reservoirs) - the system that manipulates us just more subtle
and sophisticated.  If "the price of liberty is eternal vigilance" then
we've all failed in our duties as citizens.So, in as far as it goes, Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a bad film, and it might
just open up a few eyes (though the ridiculous polarisation of votes on IMDB
shows just how unwilling most people are to have their eyes opened or their
minds changed - how many of the people that voted 1 or 10 actually saw the
film first?), but it really hardly scratches the surface of the problems
that led to the state the world is in today.  Maybe that's a bit much to
expect of a 2 hour film though :)As an aside - now that I've seen both, I really can't understand how the
Cannes jury picked this film over the Korean film OLD BOY.  F9/11 has a more
powerful subject matter, for sure, but as a piece of film-making it's not
even close to the same league.

Anyone wanting to figure out who to vote for this November could do worse
than getting a dose of reality and watching this film. OK, I'll grant you
that it is somewhat unfair at times and Moore even admits as much in the
commentary, but it is presumably basically truthful (if it were not, he'd
know as would everyone involved that they'd have their pants sued off for
libel). Enormously effective at times, the film takes you on a roller
coaster ride of emotions from the depths of despair to the highs of hilarity
and who could fail to be moved by a mother's loss of a son serving in Iraq?
She went from being supportive of Bush to despising the whole situation
because now she understands from first hand experience what us 'liberals'
are complaining about.If you're a right winger of any description, you're going to hate this movie
because it makes Bush look like the idiot he is, shows just how corrupt most
of the leading players are and could have a helping hand in ousting the GOP
from power come November. It is my fervent hope that the DVD will be released in October to give the
maximum possible number of people the opportunity to learn a thing or two
before they vote.I say Well Done! Michael Moore for having the skill and nerve to make this
film as entertaining and to the point as it has turned out to
be.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see Michael Moore has a low opinion of
President Bush and his...well associates.So what!  The man has the complete right to make this movie and have it
reflect totally his agenda...come on you neo-fascists...this is still
America...we allow folks to say things we don't like....or do
we?This is the best of Mr. Moore's works by far and I think it is because he
feels so passionately about the subject matter and how important it is to
get his side of the message heard.If Mr. Moore's point is to point out the obvious...that Mr. Bush panders to
big oil and big bucks...then  duh? That is not news. If his point is that
Mr. Bush has led us as a nation into a terrible war for no viable
reason...and I am not sure he fully makes that case...but if that is his
point...then that warrants much more consideration and thought by us
all.The point that poor youngsters do the dying and rich ones don't even
serve...well that is trite too....but maybe the public needed reminding of
that point?Wars are horrible and they dehumanize all who are in them...but that is not
a new point either.If this is a consolidation of all the above points with the express intent
to hold the Bush family responsible for what a mess that things are
in...well it hits that dead on target.In fairness to Mr. Moore I am not sure he ever said the film was anything
else. He knows that Democrats are very diverse and out number Republicans by
at least 1/3 and if he can solidify their positions and focus their
anger...they cannot be stopped.  I think this film will do that if it does
nothing else!

This is a powerful film which works deeply on several levels. Scenes change
from outright hilarious, then switch to provocative, and then to extremely
sad and frightening. The sad fact is that there is a large part of American
society which rejects this movie as anti-patriotic, when in fact I have not
seen a film which portrays the real meaning of patriotism better.One of the best lines in the movie is what our servicemen and women ask from
us..."that they are never sent into harms way unless it is absolutely
necessary". This movie forces us to think a lot harder on that issue of
sacrifice than we ever have before. Those who should really see this film probably never will. But for those
willing to open their eyes, they will indeed be rewarded with a better
understanding of why Bush is the wrong president for our time.

I wish everyone in America would see this movie. The present administration
is the most corrupt this country has ever seen and this movie bares it wide
open.I laughed, I cried. Moore's wit cuts like a knife. This movie is extremely
well edited and shows scenes that we've never had the chance to see
before.I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority (if not 99%) of those people
that have voted this movie a one, haven't even seen it. If they had they
wouldn't. I saw this movie in a packed theater and there was a long line of
people outside for the next showing (and I live in the
suburbs).GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!

The first thing I noticed from reading the negative comments on here is that
it's clear the people blasting the movie didn't bother to actually see it. 
Leaving knee-jerk insults based on ignorance and innuendo doesn't say much
for the intellectual heft of the right.That said I was more than a little disappointed with this this movie.  Much
of the first half was entertaining but offered little more than guilt by
inference.  It would have benefited from digging deeper into links between
the Bush family and the Bin Laden's and the Saudi Royal family.  There's
probably enough material there for an entire documentary.I felt that the movie went largely off-track in the second half when it
focused on the grief of a mother who lost her son in Iraq and on recruiting
practices in Flint Michigan.  The problem?  While the scenes of the mom's
grief are undoubtedly affecting, people die in wars whether they are just or
not.  This woman's grief doesn't speak in any way to whether Bush is a liar
or the war is a sham and since it doesn't forward the case Michael Moore is
supposedly trying to make it really shouldn't be in the movie.  Likewise
Bush doesn't personally have anything to do with the fact that poor people
are more likely to enlist in the military.  I'm sure that was the case
during the Clinton administration as well.Michael Moore apparently felt that he had made his case and that he could
turn the last half hour of his film into a salute to our troops, but I think
this was another miscalculation.  I can't help but think that Moore might
have done this so he can claim to still be a patriot even though he is
attacking (deservedly) our war-time president.The best part of the film by far is footage from Iraq, mainly because our
worthless news organizations behave as if it is their job to support the
government and its policies rather than show the American people what is
really going on.  Iraqi footage of the dead and wounded and of a raid in an
Iraqi family's home is amazingly powerful.  If the news here wasn't so
sanitized and one-sided then we probably wouldn't even need someone like
Michael Moore.All in all I would recommend Fahrenheit 911 but I think Moore missed a
singular opportunity.  He definitely lands some punches but never comes
close to a knock-out.

Of course, those of us with our eyes open have seen many of these ideas as
they happen, and I hope that this film opens the eyes of other people as to
what is really going on. This is truly the hardest film to watch I have ever
seen. I am a movie buff, and have seen thousands, but knowing this is
happening right now, in reality, to our country, sickens me. How sad to see
the footage of the Iraqi children in pieces with their families in deep
grief, how sad to see the mother of a dead soldier helpless in the street
outside the white house, how sad to see the hospital for our American
servicemen without legs or eyes or arms in so much pain they need constant
morphene.  You won't see this on Fox News, which Moore points out, Bush's
cousin is news chief of. Or really any of the American news networks. We are
being "protected" and by not showing us this footage, we believe Rumsfield
when he says "Our precision weapons make for a very humane
war."The scary part was the Psychiatrist, who pointed out really what we all
know, that when people are in constant fear, they are easily controlled.
This explains the constant threat levels going up and down, and warnings of
attacks bigger than before, and notice how the level has never gone to blue
or green, so we can breathe some relief. No weapons of mass destruction also
surprises me, I would expect Bush to plant them there if he couldn't find
them, although it's not yet election time, maybe that's his big pre-election
surprise!It disgusts me to know that our health care is being cut, drug programs
destroyed, environment being destroyed, people losing their jobs here, so
that the wealthy can become wealthier, and at the expense of innocent lives
and sovereign countries. While I am not totally impressed with Kerry's
personality, I will surely cast my vote for him, and I would cast it for
Bozo if it were necessary to get this mad-man defeated.Moore also points out a fact that I have strongly believed since 9/11, that
we should have sent the same 200,000 troops into Afghan. and on their
borders immediately and possibly we would have many more Al Queda and maybe
even Osama. But many were able to escape because the number of troops we
sent was less than the patrols in the city of New York. I have always
thought this was a huge mistake, as well as taking many that were already
there out to ship to Iraq!I was very much into Michael's Columbine documentary until he did the stunt
with Charlton Heston, I thought that was totally wrong. But here, he has
made a brilliant, if not the most important, documentary ever, and my hats
off to him for helping to show those undecided voters, and maybe some
decided, what is really happening.  Anyone who contests things in this
movie, cannot face the truth, because he shows proof of almost everything he
says.  Thank you Michael, you have done a great service to your
country!

This isn't the best film of the year, but it's certainly the most
important. We already know that the war with Iraq was all based on a
lie--and now we know that the truth is far scarier than we thought. At this writing, 1400 people have given this film a 10/10, and 700 gave
given it a 1/10. Okay, seriously, there is no possible explanation for
someone giving a DOCUMENTARY a 1/10 unless a) the footage makes them feel stupid for thinking what they dob) they're scared the footage might shake up their beliefsc) they haven't seen it.I'll bet my paycheck that each and every one of those 700 haven't even
seen the damn film. Any takers?

SEE THIS FILM.If you are an American (especially but a variation on this applies to
everyone else) and think that our freedoms and being proud to be an
American is still important then you should see this film.Well, I have to say that I used to be a wholehearted supporter of Moore
and then his decision to support klarke in the presidential race really
soured my opinion of him. F/9-11 though and his actions since have
however notably increased my opinion and renewed admiration for what he
has accomplished.The film is a powerful indictment against the illegitimate bush
administration, at times gut wrenchingly powerful and saddening and at
others body-shakingly hilarious, it points out the ties of the
administration to Saudi Arabia, corruption of the rest of the
administration, and most importantly the toll that the (again)
illegitimate Iraq war has had on U.S. soldiers and their families at
home, and finally a powerful argument against ruinous war on the
innocent civilians-PEOPLE of subjected target nations.If you value the continuation and progression of the human race and
generations to come... If there is one film that you see this year this should be it.P.S. Of course I have to say to call this "documentary" really
stretches the definition though what that really is many still argue.
At first some scenes may almost may make you cringe with some
"over-the-topness" I submit though -in my own experience- that perhaps
this is the initial shock, once you have some time to digest the
enormity and power of the film you will see its WORTH.P.P.S. For a AWESOME 10/10 documentary (much easier to see as one) I
suggest the film, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," I can almost
guarantee you will not be disappointed but I can't go that far ;).

I strongly believe what Michael Moore was saying. Everything that I saw
in this movie shocked me, though. I can't believe all that happened in
Iraq. I mean when they showed that older woman crying to God and
wondering why those things were happening to the civilians, it just
made me cry. I felt so bad about what our country was doing. It just
absolutely sickened me.I agree with the comment Joseph Pintar made about censorship and I hope
more Americans will see this movie during the time it is in theaters.
When I went to see this movie it was opening day and the movie was sold
out. Most of the people in the audience, we guessed, were Bush-bashers.
But I know, and I put emphasis on know, that there will be others.
Maybe then they too will understand what kind of point Moore was trying
to make!

I'm surprised that almost all votes are the maximum or the minimum.
It's a sign of how polarized politics have become. I wonder how many
voters actually have seen the film, which I regard as powerful,
opinionated, rather rough in spots, and perhaps preaching only to the
choir. I agree with Moore's viewpoint. We need to get Bush and his
masters out of power before he does more damage to our country. In
retrospect, Reagan wasn't all that bad. Moore's accomplishment is more
political than cinematic. He should get points for showing us that the
emperor has no clothes. He should also get points for his passion,
which is evident in the film. I recommend that people see it regardless
of their political opinions or lack of such opinions.

Unlike Mr. Moore's academy award winning documentary "Bowling For
Columbine," in which the film-maker struggled with a question with no
simple or easy answers (why is the U.S. such a violent society?), and
looked at the issue from various points of view, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a
decidedly polemical film in which Mr. Moore carries a red-hot flaming
chip on his shoulder. That this chip is composed of moral outrage,
offended patriotism, and grieved compassion will make it cathartic for
those who share Mr. Moore's views. The film is a loosely structured
indictment that tries to present enough issues & accusations to
populate at least 3 or 4 episodes of PBS' 'Frontline.' As someone who
regards George W. Bush as the worst U.S. President in my lifetime (of
40+ years), I tried to assess Mr. Moore's methods with an eye on how
fair I would find them if he was a right-wing film-maker attacking an
administration I genuinely respected: by that criterion, I think he
often crosses a line into almost adolescent denunciation of his
targets, and such moments are unworthy of the substantive and
compelling scenes, questions, and arguments that make much of this film
so powerful and worthwhile. Despite its flaws, this film contains so
much that is pertinent, revelatory and reprehensibly under-reported by
the mainstream U.S. media that it makes a valuable and important
contribution to this critical moment in our national discourse. It is
also funny, heart-breaking, infuriating, and entertaining. Definitely
recommended!

Regardless of the loads of naysaying I've heard lately, this film did not
let me down in any way.  It was excellent.  I had even wondered if, because
of all the pre-release hoopla, I had already seen and heard most of the
salient points.  Wrong.  The film is jam-packed with thought-provoking,
edifying, wrenching images and information.  You really should see
it.Some folks think that Michael Moore made this movie not because he had a
point of view about the Bush administration but because he is: a)
egotistical; b) greedy; c) evil; d) all of the above.  Now that I've seen
it, that stance seems like a good case of "kill the messenger."And, if Fahrenheit 9/11 seems one-sided to you, what about the creepy,
you're-with-us-or-against-us government we've had for the last three years? 
It's been sadly, scarily, incredibly one-sided and, unlike a film, it
affects our lives every day.  That's precisely why Fahrenheit 9/11 had to be
made.Thanks, Michael Moore.  Well done.

Say what you will about Michael Moore: he is a jerk who gets into people's
faces.  He tends to be rude and self satisfied at times.  However, he has
probably made his best movie yet in Fahrenheit 9/11.  Moore shows how we
were duped into approving a war with Iraq even though there was no evidence
to show they had anything to do with the 9/11 terror attacks.  He tirelessly
shows how George W. Bush has deceived the American people with an
ineffective war on terrorism.  This movie shows how the haves acquire more
money and power while the have nots die for the power of the haves. I want to close my remarks directly at the movie theatres who refuse to show
this movie.  Shame on you!  You can have junk like White Chicks showing all
over the country.  Yet you have to look very hard to find a theatre showing
this movie.  That is censorship and that is wrong.  Also shame on all the
people trying to prevent the American people from seeing this movie.  This
is America and people have a right to see another person's point of view
other than your own.  I encourage everybody to see this movie to show that
the rich and the powerful cannot tell us what to see.

Unlike many of the alleged "reviewers" who comprise the 31% who gave the
movie a "1", 
I actually *HAVE* seen this movie, and you should too! While there's very
little in it that 
wasn't known before, Moore's contribution is to wrap the anti-Bush
indictment up in a 
neat and, yes, entertaining package.The movie is at times funny, poignant, and, occasionally, very hard to take.
The reality 
of war is that it is bloody and brutish, and in the middle section of the
movie, Moore 
pulls no punches, showing us both the Iraqi civilian victims and the
American military 
victims. And all along the way, he builds the case that our leadership do
not belong in 
the White House but rather in the Hague, on trial as war
criminals.Cinematically, the film is probably Moore's best. He manages to avoid
inserting himself 
into as many scenes as he has previously, and this avoids some of the
sequences that, 
in his previous films, almost rose to painful levels. The one extended
sequence where he 
directly participates (the attempted recruitment into the military of the
children of 
congressmen) is entirely appropriate and very, very striking.This movie is a 10; it certainly deserved the Palm d'Or, and it deserves to
be watched by 
*EVERY* American!

From the opening credits, the audience knew something big was unfolding. As
the cast 
of characters (George W., Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powel, Rice and a disgusting
Wolfowitz [sp?]) 
prepared for their "roles," a sinking feeling took hold of my gut. I was
about to see what the 
failed administration (and irresponsible media) had been hiding (or maybe
just withholding) 
for three years. 
The cost of war can be calculated in the haves and the have-mores (Bush's
words, not mine), 
dead babies, mutilated American soldiers, beheadings and many, many, many
destroyed 
lives.  And Bush has many friends with their fingers moving feverishly over
the calculator 
ringing up profits from this quagmire. These are the same folks who beat
their chests to 
the Star Spangled Banner and constantly refer to the bravery of the soldiers
(the same 
soldiers who ironically make it 
possible for these folks to cash in). Anyone can wave the flag and spout on
about liberty, 
freedom and the importance of defending these rights. But it took a true
blue American to rip 
the sheep's clothing from these wolves misleading the American people. Thank
you, Mr. 
Moore, for proving to the world how dangerous Bush and Co. truly are. Every
patriot must 
know this and make it a 
No. 1 priority to pile-drive him from his throne.

Any American that protests this movie without even seeing it is sick in the
head. They don't even know how sick and wrong they are. The Bush
Administration is the lowest form of scum. They are sending our young
citizens to die for nothing but oil and money. It is all business for them.
To those protestors who say that Moore hates this country or hates our
troops you are pathetic liars. He is standing up for our troops safety. They
should not be fighting a war for oil and money and the Republicans want to
sweep that under the rug. Anyone that sees this movie and still votes for
George W Bush is mentally damaged beyond all hope. This movie should be required viewing by every citizen of this country.
Every single one, including Bush and his lying cronies. This movie proves
that Republicans have absolutely no shame and will stop at nothing to better
their pocketbooks. This documentary is absolutely amazing. Kudos to Michael Moore for having
the guts to show the truth to America and the rest of the world at a time
when Republicans are using terror to scare people into submission.If Bush gets elected in 2004 then there is no justice and America has lost
its mind. We need to get these relentless, lying, oppressive, right-wing
freaks out of the white house and keep them out. Bush has to be a one term
president or America will fall into the abyss.Thank you Michael Moore. You are an amazing man!And Bush, you owe an apology to every family who has lost a loved and every
soldier who has been maimed for sending them into this unnecessary war. Bush
you are despicable.

Thank goodness for Michael Moore.
We need more people like him.
More people who are not afraid
to tell and show the truth.
This movie tell what most of America knows, that Bush is an awful evil man
who's agenda to go to war for only for two things.... OIL &
MONEY.
Poor, poor souls, our children who had to go to war on the idiot's stupid
command.  Him and his cabinet should all be burned at the
stake.
Thank you Mr. Moore for standing up for everyone who can not, and does not
have the power to ask the questions that you do.
You ROCK!!!

Now I know why the Right didn't want me to see this movie.Mr. Moore does an excellent job deconstructing G.W. Bush presidency.  He may
make his and there, but I only have to think that people that have called
Michael Moore a liar haven't seen the movie.  Sadly, the facts are all there indeed and people that don't believe are in
denial and do need to deprogram. Anyone that follows the news is aware of
the things that are happening since G.W. Bush took office. The movie just
adds two plus two. Excellent movie, better than Columbine. Michael Moore deserves the Palm
D'Or, he deserves all the prizes, including the Oscar.Thanks to Mr. Moore for making this amazing movie!

Not that I'm an arbiter of tastes, to be sure, but I just got back from
Farenheit 9/11, and I am holding back the tears. Is it slanted against Bush? Duh. By that, do I mean that it makes a
compelling & hard-to-dismiss argument that Bush has used fear for political
purposes while doing nothing to make America (or the world) safer? Yep. Lots
of other subsidiary arguments of a similarly liberal bent? Uh-huh.Are the facts played with fast & loose? Well, the specific examples that I
have heard so far from the right-hand side of the aisle turn out to be straw
men or total bulls**t. As far as I can tell, MM has pretty much stuck to the
facts, except where he's obviously offering up his own opinions. I'm sure
the Hannitys & Coulters of the world will torture out something they think
will invalidate the whole thing, though. It's how they make their money,
and, God bless them, this is America & all that.Is it an MM ego-fest, like you've been told? A little. If you hate the man,
you'll hate about 5% of the film. But for the most part he's done a pretty
good job of getting out of the way and letting the footage explain itself
(full disclosure forces me to disclose that I actually like his little
political theater stunts, but just cause I wish I'd thought of them first.
Especially the wallet exchange from a few years ago).Why the hell am I telling you this? Because I am stunned at the power of the
film, and want to share that with you. I expected to like it, but I honestly
didn't expect it to be this good.That's all. You've already made up your mind if you're gonna go see it or
not, and I'm stupid enough to think I can change your mind. Just saying
that, even though I'm part of the choir it's preaching to, it's, in my mind,
a fine movie. I'll be seeing it again. But I will have nightmares tonight.

I'll give you my review, but first, a question: did you see the graph for
the votes on this film? Holy cow! That's the most polarized thing I've seen
since the year The Academy gave a lifetime achievement Oscar to Eli Kazan.
As of this writing, 61.8% of voters give "Fahrenheit 9/11" a ten, while
31.0% give it just a ONE, with mere fractions inbetween.  By the same
yardstick, "The Passion of the Christ" is a model of consensus.  Way to go
Roger, you've out-polarized Jesus.Let's be clear: I don't like Mr. Bush but I like this film - surprise! So
group me with the ten crowd (actually I gave it an eight, but it feels
lonely).  But this "what-side-are-you-on" aspect is both Fahrenheit 9/11's steel toe
and Achilles heel. This film practically feels like an infomercial for the
Democratic party. Though it uses documentary techniques, it is not a
documentary, any more than Don Cherry is a news journalist.  Rather, it is a
well-said rant, using the powers of selective focus, clever editing, and
moving pictures. You know, like political TV commercials
do?My biggest objection: that scene where the mother reads her dead son's
letter saying not to vote for George Bush.  My second biggest objection: that scene where the soldier suffering from his
injuries says he used to be a Republican, but now he's going to become "very
active" for the Democrats.  And my third biggest objection: the scenes of Iraqi children playing,
implying how free and wonderful life in Hussein's dictatorship was before
those nasty Americans came over and bombed the place. Man, if I were a
Republican, I would have walked out.But I'm not. I'm a Canadian, living in a peaceful country whose armed
services DID NOT join the fight in Iraq. Why? Because our government, the
one neck-deep in scandal, the one fighting for its life at the polls, the
government we might bounce out of office on Monday, said not to. Despite all
their admitted and grievous failings, when the pressure came - from the
American government, from other allies, and from the conservative opposition
- to join in, the Liberals stood firm and said no. To former prime minister Mr. Chretien: sir, I don't like you, but I thank
you. To all you other Canucks out there: gang, we've got a choice to make on
Monday. And it isn't so darned simple. Please think it through. Vote
wisely.

This is the only Moore film I have been able to watch and not come away from
it thinking, 
"Gee, I'd like to agree, but it seems like he's really playing fast and
loose with the facts."  This 
pretty much sums up what the liberal media has been saying for the last few
months, and 
Moore does it with finesse.  Randy Rhodes only wishes she were this
eloquent, and 
conversely, I find her to be a little too far left nowadays.Of course, a movie like this is important in two ways:  it serves as a
historical document of 
the administration, and it serves as a blast of balancing opinion to counter
the overwhelming 
conservative bias of the mainstream media.I only wish I lived in a battleground state.  It will be interesting to see
if this film makes an 
impact, since film is a rather unused tool in the fight for public opinion. 
That said, this film 
is a decidedly biased view of things.  But if all you watch is Fox news,
maybe you should 
listen to the other side for once and then decide.

JUST THE FACTS MAM, JUST THE FACTS; AND DEM 'R THE FACTS !  10/10 June 25th.I'm one of the few voters who can say that I actually saw the film before
voting. A lot of good visuals for all the dialogue we've been hearing since
9/11. The movie/truth speaks for itself. Any lies (and I doubt it) will be
public soon; if any.  Most of it I already knew but I was surprised how great of a crash-course in
all-of-9/11 it was.  
 
I was hit with all those film clips putting faces to all that dialogue we've
been hearing since 9/11.   A must see film for those wanting to learn for
themselves what is happening around the world related to 9/11.    
One scene that I had never seen was the 4 tribal Talibans visiting Bush in
Texas.  They didn't look too happy being filmed by the media and probably
knew, and were smart enough (more than Bush) to know that that film footage
would be shown in a not too pleasant way. 
 
A lot of visual images fast paced in 2 hours. My screening didn't have a too
good "digital" look; part of it due to clips from video.  MMoore covers all
bases.   Bushes, Cheney, all the way to Wolfowitz are the best actors, and
script writers including the Saudi royals and family, along with Bushes
friends and work colleagues at Halliburton, Enron, Arbusto, Carlyle Group,
Saudi connections, etc....    American poor, American soldiers,  American
and Iraqi mothers of dead soldiers and relatives, respectively. The only
ones not playing major acting roles were Sadam and Osama.   
Even though I new most of the stuff; I found it to be quite a fast paced
story and one shouldn't blink. Great story telling from the Horses mouth
himself; BUSH.

I just came out of a midnight screening and thought this film was
brilliant.More importantly, everyone should see this film before they even
entertain the idea of voting for George W. Bush. My sincere hope is
that people will realize how badly they were duped by this
administration and will never allow themselves to be manipulated like
this ever again. Michael Moore has created the 21st Century equivalent
of Thomas Payne's "Common Sense". As usual, Mr. Moore does an excellent job balancing hard truths,
information and humor and heart. Even when the film looks at some of
the hardest facts about this Iraq war, he manages to lift you up with a
laugh right after. To anyone brainwashed by the Bush/GOP/FOX News Channel propaganda
designed to discredit Moore and his film, go see the film and then see
if you still support this circus in Washington DC. I don't see how
anyone with half a brain or a heart could not feel enraged by how
they've been manipulated.

I went into the movie thinking this is gonna be bunch of anti-America,
leftist propaganda. I came out with my eyes opened... this movie is not
anti-America, it's just anti-bush because in his opinion (Moore's) Bush
is actually damaging US interests and its citizens. It's based on the
facts that the director want to show us according to his opinion,
nevertheless, it's the same thing the administration is doing and at
least Moore is assembling it from actual events and actual persons...
Anyway, if you are 100% pro-Bush (not necessarily pro-US interest, just
pro-Bush), you probably not gonna like it. It portrays Bush as a lazy
imbecile with big corporation pulling his string. Maybe there's some
truth to that, the fact that Bush is really tightly associated with the
oil & energy industry, really speak for itself.

This is not for the faint of heart. Be prepared for a two hour barrage
of facts, figures and opinions that will further polarize and validate
the two sides of the political spectrum. After all, isn't that what
Michael Moore has done and what he does best, getting people riled up?
If you agree with Mr. Moore's politics,it will validate what you may
already feel. If you do not agree with his politics, you flat out won't
like the film. If you're in the middle, well, you better get out of the
way, because this is going to get ugly before November...This is a film
that will spark debate, but will it change peoples minds? Probably not,
I didn't see any surprises in the film, I don't think that, if you've
made a decision one way or another that it will inspire you to change
your mind, but rather it will get people talking, debating, and excited
about something we haven't been excited about in a long time, the
political process.

I saw the midnight show in Stony Brook, NY last night (early this
morning). For this film, I wish IMDb would require ticket stubs prior
to posting comments or votes. Move America Forward's Howard Kaloogian,
a leading critic of the film, admitted yesterday in a live Air America
Radio interview that he had not seen the film. He said he read a
"transcript". Looking at the negative comments -- presumably the "1"s
in the voting, I get the distinct impression that many if not all of
these reviewers have not seen the movie, and are only repeating things
that they have heard from their own anti-Moore sources.Well, here are some comments from someone who saw the movie. It is
brilliantly made and vitally important -- whether one agrees with Mr.
Moore's view or not. The most important aspect of this movie is that it
is telling the story that our mainstream media is for the most part
ignoring, and/or people have seen and forgotten. If one is to fault Mr.
Moore, it is in showing us the focus of the facts that he wishes us to
see. For example, while showing the devastation and innocence of the
average Iraqi (you know, the ones we're there to liberate) he does not
mention nor show any of the excesses and evils of the Hussein regime.
(actually, there were one or two in passing -- eg. using the weapons
that we provided Iraq with in the 80's).However, is there anyone in this country that does not believe that
Hussein was a repressive dictator who oppressed his own people? The
focus of the movie is trust in _our_ government leaders. I watched two
hours of Mr. Moore telling this story in his way, and I can't think of
anything I saw that I would like to have had cut in favor of showing us
things that have already had ample play over the mainstream and other
media sources. "R" Rating - This rating is justified for the 10-20 minutes(?) of war
scenes, including truly horrifying images of the devastations of this
war. It makes a concerned parent wish for an edited version more
suitable to pre-teens, younger children, and people who are
understandably sensitive to such graphic depiction. (The more gruesome
images may not have amounted to more than 10 minutes. They made such a
lasting impression though that it's hard to be quantitative about it
now!)Despite criticism I heard yesterday, this film portrays our military in
a respectful way. The message is clear -- the controversy lies not with
our military, but with the policy makers putting them into harms way.At the very least, this extremely well made factual movie is an
important component of our national debate. It tells its story with
respect and tension-relieving humor as appropriate. It is a must see.

Once again Michael Moore has proven himself to be an expert when it
comes to digging up the truth. He uses his trusty forum of film to
bring the truth to not only the rest of the world, but most importantly
to the American people who otherwise would continue to be ignorant of
the things going on around them. He has the footage, he has the
paperwork, he has the interviews, and he has the facts to back him up.
No matter how much the awful truth hurts, there's no disputing that it
is, indeed, the truth.To those who think they want to re-elect George W. Bush in November, I
urge you to see this movie. For those who have seen the movie and STILL
want to vote for good ole Dubbya, see it again. Please!

another great piece of work by Moore. while this film doesn't have as
much polish and presentation as "Bowling for Columbine" (which i still
feel is his best work) it presents a lot of facts and footage which
have not been exposed to mainstream US audiences by the corporate
media. stress should be placed on the term "footage" since just the
large volume of video clips shown in this film and nowhere else makes
it required viewing for anyone who feels the media is unbiased or
uncontrolled in this country.also fantastic were the large amount of interviews with recruits,
soldiers, and their families. Moore shows the true human impact of war,
particularly worthless and pointless war. Of particular significance is
the change we witness in one soldier's mother. Spending much of her
life uninformed and wrapped in the safe blanket of blind patriotism,
her first interviews show her pride in the children she's sent to war
in the past. Later, when her son's helicopter is shot down in Iraq,
reality hits her like a ton of bricks and she realizes the lies she's
been force fed by the government. Her pain and anguish is palpable and
should open the eyes of many pro-war families.See this film, with a group of friends if possible. Naturally, there
are plenty of right-wing ignoramuses who will immediately dismiss all
of Moore's work... but there are a lot of good, hard-working,
independent-thinking Americans out there who don't know how badly
they're being screwed by this administration. Take some of THOSE people
with you to see the film and it could have a HUGE impact in November."It always amazes and impresses me in this country, that the people who
have it the worst -- the people who are taken advantage of by big
businesses and by the government -- are always the first to step up and
say 'what can i do' or 'how can i sacrifice' when their country needs
them." - Michael Moore (i'm paraphrasing from memory, but the film's
final lines are truly patriotic and powerful)

Those who are scared of the 'camera does not lie' message portrayed in
this documentary claim that questioning authority is treasonable and
even Un-American (tell that to Patrick Henry). I, however, challenge
the patriotism of any American, who simply out of partisanship, refuses
to hear ALL sides that attempt to explain why 848 of our own young men
and women are dead. In a 'politically advanced' society such as
America, censorship and oppression is hypocrisy and only a major step
back for democracy. If Fahrenheit 9/11 is not being shown in your local theater I encourage
you to make a phone call and ask why not. It is reported that worried
right-wing groups are using big money intimidation tactics throughout
the nation. If, on the other hand, your local theater is showing the
film, call and thank them for showing true patriotic courage. I very
highly recommend this documentary.

I just saw Fahrenheit 911, and it blew my mind. This is a revolutionary
film, that will turn the tide of the election 2004 in favor of John
Kerry, for the better. This portrays President Bush and his staff as
deceitful, greedy, war mongers, and backs up his claims with cold hard
facts. It is a film filled with heart, as portrayed in the scenes with
the mother of the soldier killed in our operations in Iraq. Michael
Moore even manages to make Al Gore look stupid , as if that is so
tough(Jk I'm a Democrat.) He manages to assault the viewer with facts
and information that might be overwhelming to some, but it cannot be
ignored. One of my only gripes is that he makes Iraq appear as a serene
peaceful country before America invaded. For the most part it was
stable, but that doesn't mean it was as wonderful of a place as the film
would like you to believe. But this film is definitely what the doctor
ordered, and any American who needs and excuse to get fired up about
their country, should see this film. The R rating completely
unnecessary, btw.

The last time I saw a packed house was at the opening of the movie
Batman in the late nineties. The DC comic turned celluloid enjoyed
unparalleled media hype and a mega advertising blitz. So to see a full
house for a documentary at 11am on a workday was impressive. A woman in her 60's crossed the parking lot of the Baxter Avenue
Theater wearing a 'F%$k Bush' t-shirt. The politically active turned
out in full force to get the first glance of this film. The theater was
predictably cool but the chatter was red hot, very uncharacteristic for
typical movie crowd. This discourse was intelligent, lively, and
provocative. The same expectancy I had for the feature film.I can say unreservedly that I was not disappointed. Moore has a way
with words and images that elicit the very base of our human emotion.
Along with a flurry of short clips, and blurbs, the camera would
alternately roll on though long sequences that others would be prone to
cut. Even with Moore's obvious political leanings, a voice of concern
and honesty ran through the partisan hubbub. Even stretching to
highlight the passivity of Democrats during a time of need.There are people you can never reach and this film certainly doesn't
reach out to those who most desperately need the message. In an
interview for a previous film he said: 'This is a democracy! This is
not a spectator sport!' The theme an 'active democracy' subtly played
through here as well. The film ended with a standing ovation that
caught me pleasantly off-guard. Perhaps, unlike most films, it had a
point. As I stepped into the light of the ticket counter, the eye of a
news camera peered at me and I lurched for the nearest exit.I had not intention of having my voice edited down to a three second
sound bite. That thought didn't dampen a sublime feeling of victory; A
victory over the 'code of silence' many writers and artists like myself
faced after 9/11. Americans have a rough road ahead and I am once again
proud and eager to do my part.

I would gather that most of you can decipher fact from fiction, yes?
Moore's views depicted in this film are a meld of opinion and truth.
Make up your mind for yourself, take what you might with you and leave
blind faith to the naive among us. Maybe you may even learn a thing or
two (unless of course you are a blind follower, say from the far right
ala Rush Limbaugh).Personally, I believe Mr. Moore has offered an honest interpretation of
his view of Bush and his administration. Some of his logic isn't linear
and takes a leap of faith, but I didn't see anything false. Kudos to
Moore for his vision. Hopefully this will be the final nail in W's
re-election heart!

LEADER of your country, hears about a 747 crashing into the World Trade

sincerity, the compassion for the people of America?? What IS the

I just saw Fahrenheit. It is alternately hilarious and moving-- overall
an extremely powerful film. Although I of course can't vouch
personally for the veracity of every last fact, I am an avid consumer
of print and broadcast news, and from what I've seen so far no major
inaccuracies have been found.How those facts are arranged and woven into a story is at the
discretion of the writer/director. Certainly Moore has an agenda-- of
this he makes no secret. He himself describes the film not as an
objective documentary, but as an Op/Ed piece, designed in part to help
unseat Bush this November.That being said, the film has some valuable lessons to teach.
Patriotism is not the same thing as blind nationalism. Supporting
American troops is not the same thing supporting their use as
mercenaries of corporate interest. Perhaps most importantly, wrapping
oneself in the flag and reciting angry rhetoric does not justify the
loss of thousands of lives, American and otherwise. It is nearly
impossible to see this film and not realize how overdue this country is
for a change of leadership.

First, like "The Passion of the Christ", you have to see past all of
the so-called controversy to judge whether "Fahrenheit 9/11" is worthy
of praise, or has simply been overhyped. I would definitely agree that
Michael Moore has done a fantastic job of utilizing all the free
publicity to sell his movie, but that is part of his job. Beyond all
this the question should be "is this an important movie?" and "is this
a great movie"? "Fahrenheit 9/11" is undeniably the most important movie of the year
because it shows us many of the stories that the main stream media has
either buried or ignored.So, are these stories all important? Yes and no. However, the
importance of the movie is that it should make everyone question the
motives for invading Iraq. If it was for WMD and we have not found any,
then what was it for? If it was because of a link between Saddam
Hussein and al Qaeda, and there has been absolutely no solid evidence
that any link existed, then what was it for? These were the primary
reasons for intervention in Iraq that were unique to that country.
There are many other countries that posed a greater threat (North
Korea) or where state sanctioned genocide (pick a country in Africa)
was taking place, so why Iraq? It seems that the popular response is
that regardless of why we are there, we should support our troops and
get the job done. OF COURSE!!!! And this movie is not saying that we
should leave Iraq, nor is any rational person suggesting that. Simply,
for the sake of our national reputation internationally and the lives
of our soldiers we have no choice but to question the motives of our
president acting on our behalf. I find it amazing that people don't
realize that victory in the war on terrorism is impossible without
international support.The world is too large to conduct it alone. The fact that Osama bin
Laden is still at large should alarm everyone. As should this movie.This movie accomplishes what it sets out to and nothing more. It will
make you think, but it probably won't change your mind. Regardless of
your opinion of the Bush Administration, if seeing humans devastated
and weeping at the loss of their children does not evoke emotion, then
we have already lost this war and I would fear for the future of the
country even more.

I went and saw the first showing of this movie this morning at the
local theater. I was amazed at how good this movie was. It was awesome.
Moore was at his best. When the end credits came up everyone and I mean
everyone in there applauded (the theater was sold out). People don't
understand it not Moore's point of view. He is simply giving the fact
and he proves that Bush is in fact a moron. Bush couldn't have proved
it more but his answers to questions he has answered. I can't wait to
see this film again. Michael Moore knows his stuff. If you have read
anyone of his books (especially Stupid White Men & Dude, Where's My
Country?) who will see some of the same stuff but this times it's
visualized. The Bush administration are just plain idiots. The films
should be seen by all. 100 out of 10. This rocks, Moore keep up the
great work.

I actually saw the movie last night so I feel qualified to review it.
It was enlightening, moving, and thought provoking. Several of the
facts about Bush were presented in his book "Stupid White Men", so if
you've read it you will be familiar with a lot of the movie. I had to
drive two hours to go see the movie and drive back at 4 am and consider
the trip very worthwhile. I do encourage everyone to do your own fact
checking if you feel something was inaccurate, see for yourself if he's
telling the truth. If nothing else I hope that this movie inspires
people to become more interested in the world (and I mean world) around
them. I've seen "Roger and Me, The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11, and
Bowling For Columbine and they did that for me.

It's funny how almost 800 people have already given this movie a 1 on
the day it was released, and i believe it was about 740 just last
night, BEFORE it ever came out. The Bush administration declared it
"outrageously false" without even watching it. They know they have
something to hide, they know they can't run, and come November, John F.
Kerry will, God willing, bring hope and a light of vision back to our
White House, no matter what the rich cowboy businessmen and their
partners in crime tell us. John Kerry is a viable leader, knowledgeable
and blessed with an ability to make the RIGHT decision for America. I
find it telling Bush has refused to debate Kerry; doesn't he owe it to
the people to debate John F. Kerry, our only other viable option for
the most important position in the world come November?! I would hope
that after the Democratic nomination Bush would acquiesce; but just
like on so many other decisions that Bush sticks to like glue without
good intent, purpose, and effect, he will probably duck debates at
least until September. This is akin to Stephen Douglas refusing to
debate Abraham Lincoln, depriving the American people of truth telling
sessions and discussions about the best way to move this country
forward. There is something to be said for the direct head to head
matching of words and ideas between two men that is essential for the
American people to make the right decision. It seems there is a group
of people, probably 100% Republican, who find this movie so threatening
that they feel compelled to manipulate its points rating bu stuffing
the ballot box without having seen the movie. Register to vote, and
come election day, please make your voice heard. We need to be on high
alert for shenanigans in key contested states, by attempting to put
into place at the grass roots level--we need: oversights on potential
injustice resulting from 1)Bush ties to the companies who manufacture
the voting machines, 2)Bush's friends as the people in power to decide
votes, 3) companies that don't establish an ACCURATE list of voters who
have the right to vote (especially in voting districts where incidents
occurred in 2000). If this occurs and John F. Kerry does what he has
done his whole life, the American people will be guided into a brighter
future where key decisions are made with a balance between objective
analysis and personal engagement. We will all be better off if we come
together as one as a country--this is obviously a bitter, divided
America, and a house divided cannot stand. George W. Bush has proved he
is not the man to lead us during this crucial period; please, at least
'try on' the two futures available for our country depending on who the
next president may be. Give Kerry a chance, and this whole country,
from North Carolina to Oregon, Alabama to New York, New Mexico to
Michigan, will be able to look toward a future where John F. Kerry too
is afforded the same respect and consideration as our current
President.

I was at the first showing in town, with a mostly partisan democratic
crowd.My opinion is that there were very few false notes or 'wait a minute
that sounds wrong or unfair' scenes in this movie, and as for me I went
through the entire range of emotions in the course of watching, from
chuckles and laughs, to silent empathy, to stunned outrage, to tears of
sympathy, to determination to make a change.The audience as a whole definitely was swept up in Moore's indictments,
and we all applauded the ending. All of us were captivated start to
finish, and you certainly won't be bored or uninvolved. I don't know
about 'brilliant', but this film earned its Cannes award.Like George says: "Fool me once, shame on....you. Fool me twice..."

A great movie. I don't understand why people say that this movie is so
contriversial... Either you love your country and want it's laws
enforced and want leaders who do their best to uphold our ideals, or
you want Bush in office. It is as simple as that. This film did nothing
more than tie together information that is already out there for anyone
to research and draw their own conclusions on. I really find it hard to
believe that anyone who has actually seen this movie would give it a
"1." You may simply be ignorant and not agree with the premis or maybe
you are denying undeniable truths, either way, you should have been
moved by some of the films more riviting footage of the mother of a
dead U.S. soldier and her daily grief. As a U.S. soldier myself and a
veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I was moved that someone (Moore)
cares so much about his country that he does'nt want her troops to be
killed in an optional war.Go see it. Period.

I stand corrected. Having just returned from a sold-out 4 p.m. viewing
of F 9/11, I must say: the people trying to boycott this movie? They
had every reason to be afraid.Every fear they have, and then some, is realized by Moore's ability to
synthesize the still-thickening labrynthine story of the Bush
administration and how it has deliberately misled America by it's false
stories of WMD used to push forward an agenda using lives for
bargaining chips.Forget fact checking. If even 1/10th of this film survives inevitable
attempted evisceration by those who disagree with Moore, Bush will have
to buy his way into the White House --- as a guest.The nit-picking will happen. No doubt about it. Nevertheless, as the
song says "the fundamental things apply" and they most certainly will
continue to, as time goes by.The question of how George Bush was so certain he would win Florida
that, on camera he states "You can write it down" as brother Jeb sits
next to him, smirking, is still a viable question.The fact that Bush entertained Prince Bandhar of Saudi Arabia just a
few days after a terrorist attack where the majority of the
participants were Saudis still inspires outrage.The fact that Bush's family is so tangled-up in bed with the Saudi's
that it's surprising a grainy night-vision Paris Hilton type film of
them hasn't found it's way to the Internet yet is still unseemly.The fact that Bush and Co. repeated and repeated and repeated the now
disproven "immediate and credible WMD" threat despite not having any
data is still horrifying and disgusting.Those and other facts hold together a narrative that, while quite
possibly able to be picked apart by those hell-bent on doing so, makes
an overall excellent case for the argument that something is rotten at
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and it's up to us to clean up the mess.If nothing else, the narrative offers a clear view of the need for
Americans to be more inquisitive, to broach dialogue about current
events, and to pull our collective heads out of the sand, start asking
reasonable questions and demand real answers for painful questions.All hyperbole aside, the screening I attended made some folks very
angry. Only not at Moore. News broadcast snippets showing Cheney, Dubya
et al repeating what a credible and dangerous threat received audible
groans and the sounds of ire. People were nodding in agreement at
times, crying at some parts, laughing at others. Everyone in the
theater remained otherwise intent and silent, soaking in the film.
After the final frames, most people clapped for about five minutes.Like him or hate him, Moore's greatest gift is the talent for putting
an audience into the shoes of the subjects he interviews, evocking
powerful empathy and understanding from an audience. It's the everyday
people in Fahrenheit 9/11 who leave an indelible mark on viewers;
mothers who have lost their children, elderly women who acknowledge
we've all been duped, veterans recuperating from injuries sustained in
the war and vowing to work to defeat the current administration, and
scared, huddled Iraqi women crying out in confusion to what seems to be
a deaf God: for a few moments, we are them and they are us. Despite many reviewers saying the movie's main focus in on Bush, I saw
something different in the heart of Fahrenheit 9/11 . I saw a post-9/11
populace cowed by fear and kept silent by the promise of more terror. I
saw that the terrorist's succeed with unimaginable magnitude as all of
us, frightened into inertia, stood idly by long enough to allow for our
leaders to invade a country that offered no real threat to our
security.Finally, I saw a mass awakening, little by little, person by person, to
the knowledge that we are partly to blame for the damage done, but that
we are also willing to wake up from a collective nightmare and start
asking the tough questions of ourselves and our government.These things cannot be debunked and nitpicked into pieces. They can and
will continue to resonate in collective memory no matter how many
websites devote themselves to allegations against Fahrenheit 9/11.Leaving the theater feeling like the wind was knocked out of me, I also
felt a spark of hope that I've not felt in quite some time. We the
People have the power to stand together without fear and realize what
binds us is more than blind Patriotism or adherence to a cause that is
not really ours. It's more than George Bush and it's more than Michael
Moore. In the end, the only thing that will save us is realizing, as
Fahrenheit 9/11 shows us, we are bound to each other by our humanity,
and what diminishes one of us harms us all.

this is quite simply put, the greatest horror film ever made. bravo mr
moore.hopefully you have opened the eyes of the people of our great
nation. it is not too late to right this terrible wrong. we must get
bush not only out of office but into a prison never to be heard from
again.am i crying at the moon, perhaps. to say this film is powerful would be a great understatement.i for one
went to see this film expecting to loath it and michael moore. i had
always thought of him as a propagandistic which still might be true .
he has a definite point of view that he conveys brilliantly.the really

I read somewhere that going into the film, if people hated George Bush,
they would continue to do so once they saw it, but if they loved him,
they would continue to love him. I continue to hate him and support
everything that would get him out of office. Everyone should see this
film because it is a documentary of politics today. After seeing it,
you will think twice about the people who are running the country. I
thought that the cinematic journey was brilliant in the way he
illustrated the truth. Bush indeed had no real experience before he
became President, or rather he stole the presidency. It will make you
feel for the soldiers who have to fight the second Vietnam and it will
make you see the lies that have been told to the American people, and
the world.

As parked next to a car with a sign in the window that read "It's a
fortunate thing for governments that people don't think. -A. Hitler", I
knew I was in for it. Little did I know, I was underestimating the
experience.Moore steps back a pace in 9/11, declines to be heavy handed, and
largely lets his story tell itself. And tell itself, it does. From W's
vaccuous stare in a FL classroom as he is advised that the second tower
had been hit, to former FBI Director Thomas Pickard testifying that
just prior to 9/11, John Ashcroft told him "not to mention bin Laden to
him again", to a soldier in Iraq telling the movie audience, 'If Donald
Rumsfeld was here, I'd ask for his resignation', the drumbeat is
relentless. Moore wryly narrates, but seldom intrudes. He doesn't have
to.It looks bad for Bush and his posse. Real bad. So much so, I came away
with a couple of notions. Firstly, I actually found myself thinking
that Moore probably could have come down a whole lot harder than he
did. Secondly, as a direct result of the first, I couldn't shake the
feeling that there's sooooooo much more the world needs to know. And if
we only knew . .. .Moore doesn't exactly give equal time to the Demo's, but they don't
come away without a scratch, either. He makes sure you know that not a
single member of the (1/2 Democratic) Senate lifted a finger to help
the heart-wrenching army of disenfranchised blacks testifying one after
the next at W's confirmation hearing, and makes sure you sit and watch
footage of Democratic Captains happily rubber-stamping Bush's Iraqi
fiasco.Tears will flow, and heads will shake in aghast disbelief. Heartstrings
will likely not remain unplucked. If you support the guy, there isn't a
lot of joy for you. Moore's got his facts down pretty solidly. You
might try to call it 'bad cinema', but it's simply not - actually, it's
riveting. You might shoot spitballs at this minor point or that, but
taken as a whole, well, Fahrenheit 9/11 is an indefensible juggernaut,
factually and emotionally.If you hate the guy, you'll be real glad Moore is on your side. The
Neocons in a free America (sic?) can certainly screen their alternative
version, but good luck. This time, Moore is the age-old 'hard act to
follow', and they'll certainly need it.

i sincerely wish someone else's name was above the title - because
moore's name puts off a lot of people who really should go and see the
movie because their votes can make a difference in november. and i can
tell you - every American should see this movie. if for nothing
else,just to have a chance to make one's own opinion, as opposed to be
told what to think by our politicians or/and the media. but enough of that: as a movie, F 9-11 is the most disciplined,
inteligent and powerful movie MM has ever made... although it is still
more of a personal essay than a documentary. if there is something i
could wish for, it would perhaps be better if the director/writer would
stick to one issue instead of trying to point out all things that have
gone terribly wrong in the last four years; moore should have focused
more on how bush and his people handled 9-11, and used it to justify a
war which American people would never support if they were not mislead
about iraq's connection with al-quaida. still, it is a great piece of
work, almost free of MM's (in)famous wisecracking jokes and the
presence of the man himself. most of it is really not funny at all:
it's as bitter and harrowing as a movie about war and dying can get
(forget the sanitized TV coverage). and is guaranteed to get you angry,
no matter what your politics. but in this case angry is good: if only
1% of those people who left their theater as upset and shocked and
moved as I was will do something about it, maybe there is still a
chance things will be set right again in the home of the brave.

Michael Moore has created a work of art. No new information was revealed in the movie; rather he has digested
the facts and packaged them in a coherent order so that we learn that
Bush, his friends, and his Saudi benefactors are the true beneficiaries
of the terrorist strike of September 11, 2001.It played to a sold-out audience. I had never heard of such a crowd at
a documentary. Nearly all clapped and cheered for the film.It is a shame that this site already has so many comments from
right-wingers and Bush supporters who have not seen the film. They just
want discourage people from learning and understanding the truth! By
the way, a documentary by definition is supposed to be persuasive.

Good movie overall, my standards were satisfied. Micheal Moore seemed
to take a back seat to the subject matter with this one. A masterfully
edited collection of footage of George W. Bush acting like an idiot
combined with grim war footage, occasional Micheal Moore moments,
terrorist and foreign news footage. Occasionally funny, often sad, very
aggravating information was woven together to deliver a tough punch to
the Bush team. This one's for the liberals, the democrats, the other
Americans who feel that they're not accounted for by this White House,
and ALL OF EUROPE, too! Can't forget THE REST OF THE WORLD! Anyway,
good movie, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE was better and hard to live up to,
but F9/11 should act as a wake-up call to America to do something about
these terrorists of our Government, these money-hungry billionaires who
care for nothing but their fat wallets! I love America, I am Jason, a
film maker from Mass.

Michael Moore obviously takes great liberties with the information he
obtains. He stretches the facts he finds to create an image of a person
or situation that is usually one-dimensional and oversimplified. He
never lies outright however, and the depth and breadth of his fact
findings are impressive. He obtained Bush's military records uncensored
in 2000 years before it became an issue. The same with inhumane
treatment of Iraqi's by American forces in Iraq. His details of the
extent of Bush family's ties to the Saudi's and the private weapons
manufacturers are impressive.There are blatant manipulations of emotions in the movie as well. The
pictures of smiling Iraqis flying kites and peacefully eating in cafes
before the U.S. invasion is manipulative and masks the nature of living
under someone as ruthless as Saddam Hussein. At the very least, it does
not show the entire picture.However, all of the distortion and stretching does not change the core
themes of the movie that are true. The amazingly close and special
relationship between the Bushes and the Saudis. The conflict of
interest in using government contacts to make money through the Carlyle
Group, Haliburton, and other companies. The truly horrific and chaotic
and brutal concept of committing a country to war. The fact that their
is no clean-cut, finely tuned, accurate war that only harms the bad
guys in Iraq and largely leaves the "good" Iraqis free from all but the
most minimal collateral damage. This is an illusion propagated by some
in the administration. (i.e. Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz). The movie contains powerful and moving images of people affected on
both sides of the war. It also mocks and in some cases humiliates
members of the administration. The most damning part of the movie for
me was when Bush was told about the second plane flying into the World
Trade Center as he read to school children in Florida, and he just
stupidly sits there for seven precious minutes and looks indecisive,
scared, and unsure.This movie is obviously a highly partisan attempt to get Bush out of
office. In many respects, it is misleading. However it is no more
misleading then the bombardment of information we have been getting out
of Washington for the past four years. The real central fact is that it shows how desperate America wants an
oppositional press. Most of the clips from Michael Moore's movie has
been pulled from mainstream media news. The mere fact that mainstream
media does not provide the type of critical, and oppositional role to
the government is distressing. The American people wants a media that
challenges the government, not one that vacillates between blind
drum-beating regurgitation of the government line and hyperventilation
over scandals.The American people are so desperate for an oppositional press that
challenges the government instead of bows to it that they are willing
to take time out of their day, and money out of their wallets, to get
it in a movie theater.

Michael Moore is going to win another Oscar. It was well done, showing
evidence that is tangible and researchable. It showed footage of men
and women in Iraq fighting, talking about what has been happening and
their opinions of the war. It showed the connectable links between the
Bush family and the Bin Laden family, in a thorough and direct way.
There was not a dry tear in the room during multiple scenes. Everyone
stood and clapped at the end of the film. A memorable scene was when a
congressman was talking about how he had a toll free number people
could call him at, and since he never released it, Michael Moore put
his office number on screen.Keep your eyes open as you read people's opinions, badmouthing the
movie. They may say it is Anti-American, they may say it is full of
lies, but no comment earlier than mine has actually seen the movie. The
ranking for this film is 6.4, because you can see that over 30 percent
of the votes went to a 1 out of ten. Almost every other vote went to
10. I am not saying this film was a ten out of ten, I am displaying the
corrupt attempts to judge this film, BEFORE IT WAS EVEN AVAILABLE to
the general public. Watch this film and see for yourself the opinion
and proof of the War on Terror.8 and a half out of 10.High points: Correct and verifiable information, attempting truth and
hard boiled investigative reporting. Low points: Got tiresome near the
middle, a large amount of information to digest.

I admit it, I've always been a Moore fan, but my appreciation of this
film goes way beyond simple fandom. This film is an absolute MUST SEE
for EVERYONE. Do NOT listen to ANYONE'S well-meaning review,
ill-meaning put-down, or worst yet - uninformed dismissal. You truly
owe it to yourself to experience this film on your own. If you like
Bush, you certainly will not agree with much of the material focusing
explicitly on him, but there is so much more than this to experience
and learn from. There's been so much quibbling here and there about
whether one point or another is factually accurate - usually the case
about Saudis being allowed to fly out of the country after 9/11. But
bear in mind, so much of this film is simply eye-witness footage of
actual events. Like Groucho said "Who are you going to believe, me or
your own eyes?" Run, don't walk, to the nearest <brave> theatre you can
get to.

No matter what your political point of view is, this movie will stir
something up inside the audience that for once will get people
motivated and not scared. A great point was made in this movie about
how the people in power keep us afraid and go to war to make sure that
the structure of society stays in place. And for too long we, as a
nation, have been told to be afraid and to not ask questions about the
policy in America (because that would be un-American). This movie will
cause more people to think for themselves. No matter what the political
outcome in this movie is, the fact that people can now be empowered to
go and make up their own mind about what is happening to our country,
rather than taking what is being force feed to them on national news.
Another great aspect of this movie's fallout will be that it can, and
will, be a topic of debate which will spread even more ideas that what
has already been expressed in this movie. Even more so, people will
realize that what they hear and what they thought was true, just is
not. Debate and free expression is what made this country what it is,
and this movie is the perfect way to spark even more discussions and
allowing people to not be afraid to speak their mind and say "You know,
I don't like what my country is doing, and here's why...". That point
of view isn't expressed enough today in our open media, and I hope that
this film will start that again. No matter what your political view is,
go see this movie, if not to just be more informed. I applaud Michael
Moore for having made this film at this time, right when American
needed it. For too long there has been a plethora of propaganda for
George Bush and his crew. It's about time that there was equal
propaganda against George Bush and it was presented in such a way that
all America is aware of it and can judge it for themselves.

This movie is a must see. Before you pass judgment based on the average
user rating (around 6), notice that most raters give it either a 10 or
a 1. If you are ultra conservative and can't disassociate the
entertaining value of a movie from your politics, you might be better
off going to see something else (or watch Fox News for that matter)For me, the movie is outrageously funny and, if looked at objectively,
a very subjective historical artifact, but a bona fide historical
artifact nevertheless. If you consider yourself an intelligent,
discerning moviegoer, give a chance to this movie and form your own
unbiased opinion. I gave it a chance and I am happy to say that the
movie was worth every dollar I paid in admission.

Having actually seen "Fahrenheit 9/11," I can say that there is more to
Michael Moore's film than meets the eye. Sure it's an attack on Bush and his
foreign policy, but what resonates the most about this film is the human
stories about the men and women that have fought in Iraq.The fact remains that the mass media doesn't seem particularly interested in
showing what it is like for the average American soldier fighting in Iraq.
When was the last time that you saw a news piece on a specific soldier that
was killed and effect that the soldier's death has on a family?Another thing that really struck me about this film is the hypocrisy of
Members of Congress who voted for war, but whose children are noticeablely
absent from the battlefields. According to the film, only one Congressman
has a child fighting in Iraq. This is not merely a partisan attack, but one
that crosses all party lines. Of course who is the war being fought by? The
poor and unemployed. This is made particularly clear when Moore follows two
recruiters in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. With an official unemployment
rate of 17%, the military offers one of the few opportunities for the town's
young people to find gainful employment. It's a sad commentary.Overall, "Fahrenheit 9/11" will not sway highly partisan voters one way or
another. However, it may get a few people to examine U.S. foreign policy
more closely and our treatment of veterans in general, which is definitely a
good thing.

Unlike many "reviews" here placed by our fellow Bush worshippers, this
one is real. Written by a guy who saw the movie on opening day (June
23rd) in New York City.It's hard to give an unbiased critique of this film, because there's
nothing unbiased about it. But I'll try.If you hate Bush, this is going to be just more fodder and there's
nothing here you don't already know. If you love Bush, all of Moore's manipulations, scenes taken out of
context and half-explained conspiracy theories won't lean you out of
the right.This movie is directed to the undecided. The young girl or guy who
think politics don't affect their lives and don't really matter. The
suburban, middle-America mallrat who wouldn't watch five minutes of CNN
or Fox News if it meant their lives. To those, this movie is where it
will hit hard. No wonder someone (maybe unintentionally) is trying to
stop these kids from watching it with an R rating.Moore's message is clear: Get Bush out of the White House. If these
people I'm talking about watch it, it may fulfill its purpose. Not
without the help of Mr. Dubya himself, who Moore intelligently uses as
the film's comic relief. I believe no comedian can play a Dubya as
goofy as the man himself. This is the movie's more persuasive vehicle,
because after a while of watching how his policies are shafting the
poor American working class, you don't find anything funny about his
goofiness.Unfortunately, Fahrenheit is not perfect. Moore dumbs down a lot of
theories and uses cheap manipulation to reach a broader audience. It
makes the movie more accessible, but also more likely to be a target of
ridicule by his detractors. Spoiler: (One of his many manipulative
scenes show Iraqi children playing happy and free days before the war.
Although it's true, it's only a half-true given to make a point).Despite what right wingers say, one thing that I sensed during the
whole film is Moore's patriotism. I believe there's nothing more
American than championing the little guy. That's what Moore does.His portrayal of politicians and the media being cowards, cheerleading
Bush just out of fear of being intimidated by bullies who also swarm
this Web site with faux reviews, faux votes and faux patriotism is very
accurate.Finally someone has the courage to stand up to these bullies. It's time
for the little guy to fight back. This movie made me proud of being an
American. I should make you proud too.

Michael Moore is very passionate about fighting for what is right for
America.  He is very skillful at his art and this may be his masterpiece! 
He has dug deep to get to the bottom of our current corrupt administration
(which isn't easy considering that they do most everything in secret).  This
movie should help get us a new administration and give America a better,
stronger future.
If Bush is in business with the Bin Laden family how can we expect to catch
this killer?  Well, we know that Bush has decided to turn our attention to
Iraq in hopes that we will all forget about Bin Laden, but how can we forget
such tragedy?  This movie should be viewed by everyone registered to vote,
and then go out in Nov. and vote your conscience.

The movie is fascinating and very well made. Before seeing it, I didn't
know that Bush had remained in the classroom with those children after
hearing about 9/11 or about the secret flights that took place after
9/11. More importantly, the movie is funny and engrossing. At times it isn't
completely fair, but it is unfair in these cases in the service of
entertainment rather than politics.I realize that a lot of Bush supporters are criticizing this movie,
mostly without having seen it. My advice is to see it first before
forming a judgment. I think that many Bush supporters will enjoy this
movie if they go see it with an open mind.In sum, I recommend that Republicans as well as Democrats,
conservatives as well as liberals, see this movie. The issues it brings
up are so important that they transcend politics.

Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a powerful and sobering documentary
that takes dead aim at the current occupant of the White House, using savage
satire and unrefutable facts heretofore ignored by the mainstream American
media.   Wait till you see revealing footage that the media left on the cutting room
floor -- footage of Rice and Powell in 2001, of Wolfowitz during the opening
credits(!) and of a smirking president on camera, seconds before he
announces the start of attacks on Iraq on March 19, 2003.Moore leaves no stone unturned and his moving, disturbing, humorous,
incisive and deeply thought-provoking exploration of an America hijacked not
once (by 19 Saudis on 9/11) but twice (by a Bush Administration bent on war,
fear and lies) will leave even the most die-hard conservatives
dumb-founded.There are many subjects covered aside from Iraq, the Patriot Act, Abu Ghraib
tortures, the 2000 presidential election theft, Bush-Bin Laden connections
and the painful, heartwrenching story of a Flint, Michigan native whose son
fights in Iraq.  The film also shows the despairing ignorance of some of our
own fellow Americans, in one particularly anguished scene.There's lots more.  You must see this film.  When you do, you will see why those opposed to Moore's politics are trying
to stop this film from seeing the light of day.This film isn't about Moore.  It's about the truth that we here in the
United States have had hidden from us from a compliant and intimidated
mainstream media.  Instead of trying to stifle "Fahrenheit 9/11" those
opposed should make a pro-Bush film.  If those who don't like Moore claim to
be flag-waving patriots, perhaps they should remember that exercising
free-speech is a patriotic and constitutional right.  Stifling speech is un-American and un-patriotic.

I'm sorry to say that most people today forget the beginnings of the
dictatorship/Fascist State that took over Germany. The German people
approved what the regime did and their fantasy of a 1000 year reign
lasted less than a decade. Bad things happen to bad regimes, and it is
happening to us. I would hope that most Americans who see the "Left" as
a problem would read about the history of "the left" and compare the
deeds of the "RIGHT WING" dictatorships of world history to hopefully
make an intelligent connection. What is happening here in America, to those of us who saw the 3rd Reich
come to power and control all aspects of German life, especially the
judiciary, and the destruction they created, is very similar. An old
saying says, "The truth shall set you free." But in contrast to today's
media controlled rhetoric, it should be "The ACCEPTANCE of truth shall
set you free." Of course, one assumes we are learned enough to know the
difference.We, as free Americans, need to have more "leftist propaganda", as
Fahrenheit 9/11, if for no other reason than to check the "Neo-Cons"
attempt at controlling American hearts and minds and to give us ALL a
chance to DEBATE, not be dictated to, which direction we want OUR
country to move.God Bless the True American FREE Spirit.

This is one of the more insightful and purposeful 9/11 documentaries.
Although 
it's being promoted as "shocking" and "revelatory" it's unlikely that anyone
over 
the age of 15 will be surprised to find out that presidents lie and war is
all about 
corporate profiteering. Of course it's intentionally "controversial" and
skewed in 
its presentation, it is extremely well done and fascinating in many ways. Isuspect the people who voted it a 1/10 probably haven't seen
it.

By the time this film is actually released on June 25th, there will
probably be thousands of misleading reviews and comments about Michael
Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" posted on IMDb by people who have not even
seen the movie. As I write this, there are already nearly 1,000 votes
posted even though the film's premier at the Cannes Film Festival was
less than a month ago, and the first U.S. screenings occurred two
nights ago in Los Angeles.Mr. Moore's film delves bravely and surprisingly cautiously into the
battle for truth in America politics. In one of the most insightful
scenes in Mr. Moore's film, an anonymous woman approaches Moore's crew
as they film the mother of a recently deceased American soldier talking
and sympathizing with an elderly Iraqi war protester outside of the
White House. "This is all a set-up, don't believe it," she announces to
the audience. The grieving mother confronts the accuser and tearfully
argues, "My son is dead. MY son. Why?""Fahrenheit 9/11" asks many questions like these, but the fact that no
concrete answers are suggested is a testament to Mr. Moore's newfound
restraint. The arguments and evidence presented in the film are, for
the most part, not new; they are can be found in print and television
journalism, recent investigative books like "Plan of Attack" (which the
White House unbelievably recommended on its website when it was
released last month) and "Ghost Wars," from public statements by the
Bush administration itself, and from other sources like the incredible
speech delivered by Al Gore for moveon.org in May. A great deal of the
most effective footage, like the tragic footage of numerous African
American members of Congress protesting the Supreme Court's decision to
stop the Florida recounts, which they argue constituted nothing less
than the disenfranchisement of hundreds of mostly African- American
voters, was probably shown to a tiny audience on C-SPAN and never seen
since. Moore's film is the only place where all such relevant material
can be found in the same place, and an honest, critical documentary
like this is badly needed if only because the incredible secrecy of the
Bush administration seems to have silenced many of its potential
critics. Most of the reviewers who have posted negative comments of this film
complain that it is political propaganda, and there is no denying that
Moore advances a very specific political agenda. What these
single-minded critics fail to recognize that if anything Mr. Moore says
is true, and almost all of it seems to be, there is a great deal more
at stake than everyday politics in the upcoming presidential election.
This is a film everyone should see, period. It will likely prove to be
the most widely-seen, most controversial, and most politically
influential documentary feature ever released. It is also incredibly
moving, incredibly funny, and incredibly entertaining. If it gets an R
rating, parents should be aware that it earned this rating for the same
footage of atrocities and war violence that can be seen on the TV news.

Amazing..there are over 600 comments already. I know there is no way to
enforce it, but comments should only be added once you have actually
SEEN the movie. It is just like Moore's Bowling for Columbine. So many
have never seen it yet assume they know what it is about. It is NOT a
political movie, and it is NOT about gun control. And, it (except for a
VERY small part) is NOT about that terrible event. It is about our
propensity in this country, like no other country, for violence, for
which guns are just one tool. He does explore why Americans are so
afraid and feel the need to have a gun, and how events in our history
led to that. Please, rent that movie. It is not what you think. Then,
refute or argue what he presents as facts or opinions, not about his
political leanings. I.e., don't attack the messenger for that or this
new movie. Please see the movies, then argue the facts or opinions, not
the messenger.

Saw the film at Cannes and witnessed the over 20 min. standing ovation.
The film deserves the overwhelmingly positive response and the Palm
d'Or. It is unflinchingly real even though I know there will be a lot
of mindless vitriolic denials. That's still a river in Egypt and this
film could be the first step in a twelve step program for recovery. The Palm d'Or is not a French award -- it's an international film
festival and the most prestigious in the world. There was only one
French judge on the panel. Getting past sour grapes and recognizing the
brilliance of the film-making will be impossible for many while others
will recognize the genius.

Much of the criticism leveled at Fahrenheit 9/11 is about lies and
misrepresentations. As far as I was concerned, the film's main problem
is that it failed to deliver complete and singular line of thinking and
came off as fairly incoherent.We are shown that all flights were grounded, but special treatment was
given to the Bin Laden family to leave the US. It's implied that the
George W or related federal government influences made this happen. So
what do we take away from this? Well it seems that this open to
interpretation and the nature of the relationship is not explained.
Seems there's some sort on convoluted relationship, though what's the
significance or point of it all? Sometimes I wondered whether more was implying some kind of larger
conspiracy, but he doesn't! Though it's hard to pinpoint exactly what
Moore is driving at by giving us all these facts, that are somewhat
'floating in space.' Similarly, George Bush didn't react quickly to news of the 9/11 attacks
and allowed the children to read a story about a goat. This is
seemingly significant, but why exactly??? Is Moore suggesting that Bush
doesn't care? That he knew in advance? That he's an idiot? That he
doesn't care about Americans? The US sent troops into the Middle East, but Bush didn't send enough
and didn't send them fast enough and the terrorists all got away, but
at the same time, it's terrible that the US military is even in there
in the first place. Hmm... So is it a good or bad thing that terrorists
were pursued?Recruitment for the military is directed at poor youngsters and African
Americans. The people who have so little are always the first to take
to arms in service of their country, Moore contends. It's a rightful
and poignant point to make. Yet there's some kind of racism and
overtones of lower-class inferiority in a capitalist society, which
seem misplaced in the context of the film. The woeful and
shallow-minded "Congress should send their children to fight in the war
too" part seemed to open up a contradiction, as it seems to advocate
sending more troops to war while also denouncing the war. It's all
very... muddled. And constipated. It was like that classic mistake you made when writing essays in high
school: you list a pile of facts that are relevant, but fail to use
them to make a coherent argument and work to completely tie it all
together. Combine this with the fact that the production qualities were poor. The
handycam look interspersed with grainy news clips and and rigid editing
gave it a cheap and 'college-level' feel. There's no doubt that this did not deserve the Palm D'or. While
Tarantino assured Mike Moore that Fahrenheit 9/11 got the award for the
film and not the politics, it's impossible to see how the judges felt
that way and they clearly overlooked that this film/documentary is
actually quite poor, regardless of the facts and politics.

If you were wondering whether Michale Moore was a liberal or not 1.
You're not very perceptive, and 2. This film will put all your
speculation to rest. Fahrenheit 9/11 is Moore's documentary about the
tragic events of September 11th, 2001 and how those events forever
changed the United States of America. He examines the George W. Bush
administration and how miserably they handled 9/11. He chronicles
events leading up to the tragedy and the long unfortunate chain of
events that followed. It's a film that completely backs the citizens of
the United States and especially the soldiers who fought in Iraq, and
also pulls every punch it can at the administration. It's a brutally
honest film that is disturbingly shocking and tearfully sincere.I have the utmost respect for Michael Moore and what he does in his
documentaries. He is great at putting together pieces of a puzzle and
then explaining that puzzle to you. Granted, it's a little in your face
and feels a bit preachy at times, but everything he says is what he
means, and he doesn't hold back. Fahrenheit 9/11 can certainly be
overzealous and a little too theatrical at times, but the essence of
what this documentary is about is excellent and it accumulates some
incredibly important information. This is an incredibly important film
that is put together in such a clear and concise way that even the most
skeptical viewer can walk away with something.There's a lot of anger and frustration built up in Moore that is
evident throughout the film. This makes for a film that is fueled by a
lot of pathos, but is truly driven by a logical breakdown of the
actions of the Bush administration that threw this country into such
unnecessary peril. Moore uses sarcasm constantly to exemplify his utter
ferocity towards the administration and he ironically uses an
uncomfortably lighthearted tone in the film to parallel with the
gravity of what he is talking about. Sometimes this subtle anger
undermines the logical points Moore wants to get across, but all in all
it makes sense and comes together as something incredibly important and
an argument well worth listening to.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a film that will you make you sad, angry, and
disappointed, but it's all completely necessary. It's frustrating to
see the things in this film come to light so clearly, and it
exemplifies just how well Moore can get his point across. This is a
must see documentary. Even if you don't love the way it is presented,
the facts of Fahrenheit 9/11 are gravely important, and should not be
missed.

When I planned to see this movie, I didn't know what to expect. But
this movie turned out to be so much more then I thought.It gives an insight on Bush and his first four years as president. It
shows the many consequences that America had to face when Bush got
elected. This movie is so revealing and mind-blowing, that it's
unbelievable. It gives you an insight on how important politic really
is, and how your vote can change everything. About how the choices we
make, can effect us much more then we may realize. The hard-hitting
truth. I believe that if every American saw this movie, then America
would face a revolution. Because you realize the importance of your
vote, and how you can change everything, if you want, by voting.No matter if you are interested in politics or not, or if you like
Moore or not, or Bush, you have to see this movie. I can strongly
recommend this movie to everybody and I hope that everyone will find it
as surprisingly good as I did.

I have always been raised as a die hard republican. My cousin is even
the governor of my state and was one of George W. Bush's friends and
was also very involved in the Republican party in DC for many years. So
I had been putting off watching this movie. I finally watched it on
December 2, 2005. This movie has changed my view of the Bush
leadership. When the movie showed about when Bush was at the elementary
school and did not respond to the messages of the World Trade Center
attacks, that really made me start to think what kind of president we
really have. I have been hearing that he has taken a lot of vacations
and time off while in office, but when I heard 42%, that made me
irritated. I understand like George W. Bush stated that he doesn't have
to be in the Oval Office to work but the times he spent on the golf
course, at his ranch, and even on his yacht could have been spent
better serving the American people that have put trust in him. As a
proud American I would like to say that this is a movie that you NEED
to see. All Americans owe it to themselves to watch this movie. I am
not really how much of it is biased but it makes you think.

In his newest film Michael Moore criticized the politics of George W.
Bush, the connections between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens and George
W. Bush himself.The title Fahrenheit 9/11 is a dependence on the film Fahrenheit 451.
This film deals with a police-state in which reading is forbidden and
one firefighter is against this regime. Fahrenheit 451 is the
temperature when paper begins to burn. Fahrenheit 451 is a
Science-Fiction film which was made in the United Kingdom in 1966.First Moore showed some scenes from the election campaign 2001 and that
first every TV-channel said that Gore won in Florida. They said that
when Gore won in Florida he would be President. CNN and CBS already
declared that Al Gore won in Florida. However, FOX Channel claimed that
Bush won in Florida and is President of the United States of America.
Every TV-channel followed this statement, because it was a statement of
FOX. The other TV-channels didn't do their own research. They just
followed the FOX-statements, because it was FOX. The person in
responsible for this statement was John Ellis, George W. Bush's cousin.
Of course, many people and many independent people did research and
after the recount Gore should won, but finally the highest court of
justice decided that Bush won (Friends of George Bush senior voted.).
Gore accepted this decision and so everyone has to accept that Bush was
going to be the 43. President of the United States of America.Then Moore showed the inauguration. It's tradition that the President
walks the 100 last meters before his speech, but Bush was the first
President who went in the car. Many people demonstrated and they threw
eggs on Bushes car.Then Mr. Moore presented that Bush couldn't deal with his new job and
so he just went on vacation. He played golf and such stuff. Bush thinks
that he does not have to sit in Washington to work. He can do this with
telephone and fax. In another interview he said that he has to decide
and work on something very important, but he couldn't say what it was.
He just answered the interviewer:" You will see!" Well, then Moore
shows President Bush in a school where he read out of a book together
with the children. After some time the chief of staff came in and
said:" Our land was attacked!" OK, you can't say if that is true, but
Moore said it in his film. What did George do now? Nothing. He just sat
in the school and didn't know what to do without his bodyguards and
without his counselors. Well, that's how Moore described it. I think
that when Bush would jump up, Moore would say:" What President is this?
He has to relax and think before he does something! Please George:
Think first and act later!" So, you can see this from both sides. On
September 11 2001, 3000 people died because of these terrorists. After
these attacks all flights were cancelled. Some people had to stay at
the airports, even a superstar like Ricky Martin. However, after
September 13, 2001, family members of the Bin Ladens and some other
Saudis were allowed to get out of the States. Why that? 7 to 8 percent
of the USA belong to the Saudis. They are important for the economy.
Maybe they were allowed to "fly" because of this fact. It would have
fatal reasons if they wanted all their money back. So, Bush said that
it was Saddam's fault. Some experts say that the attack on Iraq was
planned before the attacks on 9/11, but now Bush and his administration
had a reason. Of course, they had to send soldiers to Afghanistan,
because it would be dubious if they didn't. I think they sent just
10.000 or 11.000 soldiers to Afghanistan and I think that there are as
many policemen in Manhattan. So, that's not much for one country. Moore
shows very clever how often Bush brought Saddam and Al Kaida together
in one sentence. He cut that very smart and after these cuts he shows a
picture where Rumsfeld and Saddam met in 1983. That's bizarre. Step by
step Moore came to Iraq War. He shows families who lost their children.
That's very dramatic, so, Moore also asked some members of the Congress
if they wouldn't send their children first into Iraq, but most of them
didn't even listen to Moore. Then Michael Moore presented two soldiers
who wanted to fascinate young people for the Army, but most of these
youngsters didn't join the Army, because they are that patriotic. The
didn't joined the army, because they think war is good. No, they joined
the Army, because they need money. Who cut the money for most of the
people except for the rich ones? Exactly, that was George W. Bush. In
one speech Bush said to these rich ones:" Some call you the elite, I
call you my basis!" Strong words by the President.Moore already made some statements about his film. He said that it's
more important for him that Bush isn't reelected than getting an Oscar.
He said that he wanted to see his film on television before the
elections. If a film is already nine month (or before) in television
after it was shown in the cinemas, it can't be nominated for the Oscar.
However, that rule is just for documentaries. Moore meant that his film
could be nominated as best film instead of best documentary. Some
people believe that his film isn't a documentary anyway.I think FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is a good film, but I do not like it as much as
BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Maybe I just like it better, because after
BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE I knew Moore's film style.

It is entertaining. How much of it is true? Well, define "true". Like
other documentaries and too often news programmes the footage has been
edited to give Michael Moore's version of the truth. In this he is no
different to his opponents and peers.As with any such work you should not watch it in isolation if you are
looking for truth rather than entertainment.There are some poignant scenes which make some thoughtful points. Not
least regarding the US military recruitment process.I'd recommend the film to anyone. Very entertaining. Just take it with
a pinch of salt as you would any news or documentary programme. If you
are concerned - do your own research.

I have seen this documentary almost at a year after it has been
released and i was somewhat shocked but not all the way,because i have
foreseen almost everything that was presented in this documentary,when
9/11 happened i was in bed,at home,it was 3PM ( Bucharest time) and
believe me i was not shocked but awed that one of my fears was coming
true.It was obvious that US had to do something to put back on track
the economy but instead they "did nothing" and somehow that nothing was
good because it gave them the opportunity to thrive. Best regards to M
Moore but i wonder ,who paid him to do this documentary? Most likely
the only "evil" people that were not brought to the stage ( or should i
say backstage ) of war =the jews.Why isn't anyone showing the reality
which concerns this matter ,that the jews rally have an influence on
global funding and everything that has money in it?? I hope i get a
response on mail!

Normally I'm not the kind of guy that likes to watch documentaries but
I made an exception for Fahrenheit 9/11. Michael Moore writes,
produces,directs Fahrenheit 9/11 also directed Bowling for Culumbine.
The documentary was made to expose the mistakes of the bush
administration and all those involved. Also it shows where he was
during the plane crashes in 2001 turns out he was reading to kids and
stayed there for minutes.The film takes countless point of views
whether it is on the front line on Capital Hill in front of a building
or somewhere in the heartland of America. It was a true stroke of
genius and a well thought out plot. The film can only give two things
the truth of bush and the countless deaths over in Iraq from our
soldiers. Tjis film is true and inspirational in ways. Such as standing
up for the truth, and getting every answer possible. My ratings 8/10.

Good documentary. I've heard many comments like "Ugh, it's not a
documentary, it's lies", but quite frankly, there is little in here
which was reported overseas at the times. "Documentary" to some people
- particularly when they dislike what's been said, seems to imply it
has to offer two sides of a story. This documentary is there to offer
the side which most of the American media - particularly in my
experience of living in the US - tries to ignore, and shouldn't.More than just the issue of Bush's validity as President - which in
itself has been long documented as dubious by many sources - it really
puts the war into the face of the viewer. The documentary - and the
governments of the coalition know that war is a nasty thing, and the
best way to retain public support is not to show them the nasty bits,
the things you don't want to imagine happening to the innocents and our
troops. But to justify a war you have to see all those elements, it may
not be politically expedient, but it's ethically necessary that one
doesn't blinker yourself to the real nastiness of what's happening.Freedom is a worthy outcome of any campaign, but when kids are being
sent to die by their country, they and their parents need to be able to
believe their sacrifice is for the right reason. That the blood and
pain they will personally have to deal with is in the right course.
When there are issues of business incentives, family grudges to resolve
and international stability to consider as well, one has to look and
ask whether these kids are being sent in for the right reasons. A
soldier obeys without question, it just has to assume it's
administration's reasons are beyond approach, that it is honouring it's
country.These questions are the sort that I think will be foremost in the mind
of anyone having watching this film, beyond the political issue of
Bush.Yes, this is a journalistic. When the commentary says Bush wasn't in
office much prior to 9/11, it offers amusing and silly images of Bush
with so complementary music. So yes, in that respect one might say it's
one sided in it's approach, but don't let that delude you from thinking
the underline themes and facts are anything but accurate or close to
the truth.A film which keeps the attention and both disturbs and opens your eyes.
I know people refuse to watch it, but what does that prove? One
shouldn't be scared of ideas even if you disagree with them. This isn't
Moore spouting him beliefs on a podium, it's real images and factual
evidence (which as I said, you'd find in the international media for
years, it's nothing new in that respect. You don't have to like Moore
to watch it, you just have to watch it!

Since the director Michael Moore made Fahrenheit 9/11 as a political
propaganda to have George W. Bush lose in the 2004 U.S. presidential
election, regardless of its result, the main role of the film is over
once the election was done. Though Bush won and the film's objective
was unfulfilled, it had certainly produced notable effects during the
election campaign; many on both sides must have learned about Bush's
history from the film. Hats off to Moore, for that matter.Now after the election, what values does the film have? , Moore's
almost primitive techniques of manipulation, mostly on editing, which
might be installed to make the best impact on the U.S. entire
population, could be an obstacle for the film to be an objectively
documented masterpiece. In the future, the film may be likely viewed as
a satirical or even cartoonish documentary that chronicles these
bizarre four years under the Bush administration, from Bush's tricky
victory in the 2000 election to 9/11 to the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.

I am not a fan of Michael Moore. He's obnoxious, overbearing, and gets
in the way of his own arguments by interjecting hypotheses that have no
basis in fact. I hated Bowling for Columbine precisely because of this;
Moore ranted without a coherent plot, point, or trajectory to his
diatribe.That said, Fahrenheit 9/11 is by far Moore's best work. Granted, he has
a lot of material to work with, and he still gets in the way of himself
too often (i.e. why does he have to hypothesize what Bush is thinking
as he sits in a Florida classroom the morning of 9/11? The shot itself
conveys the point). However, he really does pull together many obscure
and little-known facts--about the Bush family's relationship with the
Saudis, about war profiteering, about recruitment of poor and minority
individuals, about the U.S.'s involvement in a place where it had no
business being--to make a coherent story that paints a frightening
picture of our far-too-casual-in-the-face-of-war president. The movie
is often gruesome, showing how the impact of the Iraq war goes beyond
the unnecessary death toll--it's also reflected in the wounded citizens
and military personnel--thousands upon thousands--whose lives are
forever ruined, and in the perpetual state of fear it has put the
country in when it was ostensibly supposed to do the opposite. Some
scenes are simply stomach-turning.I am a borderline Republican with an open mind, and this film really
opened my eyes. It may not have been done in the most pleasant or
tactful way, but it introduces facts about Bush and Iraq that many
people wouldn't otherwise know about, in a convenient, entertaining,
emotionally-wrenching 2 hours. Recommended to anybody, Democrat or
Republican, with an open mind. 8/10

How often do you get to see a film that transcends what we normally
think of as a film? This "alternate reality" version of what happened
during Bush's 1st term is bombastic & provocative, yes, but many forget
just how entertaining this film is. Skillfully put together and edited
(with footage never seen before publicly) this rabble-rouser caused
such an impact it's hard to believe this is "only" a film. There's
humorous footage shown during the 1st half and some eye-opening
material (Gore having to shut down the senators who were protesting the
election, an ironic state of events; Bush reading My Pet Goat to the
children, etc.) Then the 2nd half takes on a dead serious tone, raising
questions about the reasons for going to war. This has the most
powerful anti-war message since Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of
July.

Fahrenheit 9/11 was the BEST documentary film I have ever seen. I am so
proud to see this film not once but 3 times and bought the CD. I think Michael Moore has done what many people want to do but our
afraid to. You won for People's Choice Award, so you must know that we
do believe in you, all the books and movies you have made our
excellent. I can't wait till your film Sicko comes out. I appreciate
everything you do and always remember we our behind you 110% of the
way. And over look the closed minded people, they are everywhere. I was
very sad when i read your book, Will They Ever Trust Us Again, the
soldiers in Iraq and the Iraqi people innocently beginning killed is
more then words can express. CONGRATULATIONS ON OUR PEOPLE CHOICE
AWARD!! YOU DESERVE IT. Tammie

The Story:The documentary has been built around the 9/11 attacks and what
happened after. Moore blatantly charges the Bush Administration of
being hand in glove with Saudi Oil businessmen and being incompetent to
run a nation.It begins with Gore's defeat and Bush's victory in the US Presidential
Elections 2000and Moore attempts to show that Bush was allegedly
involved in manipulating the elections at Florida. The movie continues
with a lot of such allegations that seem to have arisen from
investigative journalism of Moore.The story also highlights the plight of those soldiers who have been
living bad lives after being deputed to the war on Iraq. Moore however
tries to justify that the entire war was a hoax and that Saddam was
merely a scapegoat with the so-called WMD.Moore also demonstrates realism in which he asks Congressmen and
Senators to ask their children to join the military and be sent to
Iraq. Moore has captured their negative reactions on Camera!!Comment:Moore's work is a great piece of investigative journalism wherein he
has attempted to show evidence against the most powerful man on earth.
In an age where the fourth estate is stifled by even the most menial of
the politicians, Moore's work is a star. This obviously speaks volumes
about the writer's credibility.The documentary's narrative for the first half is filled with facts
that have shades of humour. You wouldn't help laughing your heart out
at Bush. An Indian viewer would suddenly feel proud that there are
scientists and intellectuals at the helm of our country.The story of course has its negatives. The story of an Iraq veteran's
mother has been stretched beyond tolerable limits (in fact, it at least
covers 30-40% of the film). Moore's view would have been to portray one
family in such vivid detail that the viewer would himself visualize the
plight of the rest of the families. However, this idea seems to fall
flat.Since the movie has a pure American focus, a non-American viewer like
me might not have been able to appreciate the documentary in its full
spirit. But, nevertheless, Moore's great work would definitely
entertain you and you wouldn't complain.

It is just unbelievable to see so many people giving bad comments about
this movie, especially Americans. It shows how patriotism and lack of
information can sometimes blind supposedly the most civilized and free
society.Although most the facts mentioned by Moore is arguable both ways, the
fact remains that the war in Iraq NOW is about oil and money regardless
of the reason why it started. There has never been a country in this
new era which has helped other countries without evaluating the
sacrifices and benefits involved. NO COUNTRY WOULD SACRIFICE ITS PEOPLE
FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANOTHER COUNTRY. People need to understand that
United States is no exception. This is no shame to the Americans. There
simply cannot be any such country, developed or under developed. Having said that, I don't find anything wrong in Moore putting the
whole blame on George Bush. He is the President of the nation. He is
responsible for the action. If he is not to blame, who else should he
blame? He doesn't need to blame the people for electing him because
that is quite implied.In fact, the people are not to be blamed much since an ordinary citizen
has got his own worries. He doesn't have time to think about big
problems of nations including his own. That is why we call him an
ordinary citizen. Moreover he never sees or is never allowed to see the
big picture. All he does is quickly process the information he picks up
from news papers, magazines, friends etc and come up with a view which
he finds comfortable. He never bothers to critically analyze the
information and ask questions. As time goes by, these views get more
and more concrete simply because the information that he picks up later
on would be the ones that strengthen his existing beliefs. He rejects
all other information just because they do not really matter to him.
They do not matter to him as long as it starts affecting his life and
his feelings he holds dear. In a developed country like America this is particularly true because
most people have what they basically need and are not really concerned
about how others live. It is not their fault; it is plain simple human
psychology. As long as the government supplies the ordinary citizen
what he basically needs, it can be sure that he will not bother to ask
unnecessary questions about why his government interferes in Iraq or
other Middle East nations.But in all nations, there are not-so-ordinary citizens or
intellectuals, who live for certain ideologies. These ideologies can be
good or bad. Although what is good and bad is a debatable issue, it is
good enough to assume that the principle of 'live and let live' is good
and anything that does not follow that rule is bad. When these category
of people break the rhythm of an ordinary citizen by providing him with
information that is contrary to his belief it is quite natural to find
repercussions. When someone loses their dear ones for a cause and if
they pick up any information which suggests that the cause was unjust,
it is quite ordinary to see what we saw in the movie. In this case,
Moore broke people's rhythm by providing information that they
otherwise would not like to hear.This movie is a very good eye opener to an ordinary American citizen.
He needs to be more critical in what he picks up from CNN, MSNBC and
BBC. He needs to understand that he has the right to get the right
information. He needs to understand that what he sees may not be the
full picture. He needs to understand that the other countries will
judge him by the actions of his government. He needs to understand that
American must not be built by oil from Iraq or Saudi Arabia, it must be
built by Americans.

I have to say that Fahrenheit 9/11 really struck a chord with me, and
was, in my opinion, even better than most of the critics had claimed it
was (and quite a few thought it was brilliant). I honestly don't get
why so many people seem to hate Michael Moore when I don't think he has
anything to gain by going against this Presidency. I mean, I didn't
even think he was a Democrat, he was just a man, a citizen of this
country, who decided to make a documentary about the negative side of
President Bush and his politics that so many of the mainstream
television stations never aired on their "news" programs. Sorry if
people don't like an opposing view point, but unless the U.S. turns
into a dictatorship, we are allowed to have differing opinions than
you. People just assume that what we see on the news on television is
accurate, or what we read in a magazine or newspaper are all the facts.
Something like 6 different companies/corporations control all of the
channels in the U.S., and it's a wonder that there are biases? The
Sinclair Group plans on forcing it's channels to air an anti-Kerry
slander campaign (propaganda is more like it) the day before the
election. In a totally free, impartial society, a company wouldn't be
allowed to force it's political views on us. I don't care how people
vote because I can't control what other people do, but I can't
comprehend why people won't at least give this film a chance and watch
it. You don't have to agree with me that Fahrenheit 9/11 is an amazing
film that shows the complexities of our nation and the world that we
have impacted, a side that is often brushed under the carpet so that we
can hear more of the same. That's it.

I agree. The film is biased. And i wouldn't doubt that there are indeed
some or a lot of inaccuracies that have been conveyed as fact.However, to think that 100% of the film is erroneous is also not
realistic.If you are the type of person who thinks for yourself and would like to
arrive at your own conclusion, then watch the film.If you are the type of person who cannot think for yourself and do not
possess enough wit to separate fact from misleading information then do
not watch the film.There. everyone is happy.

I wasn't impressed at all by Moore's Oscar-winning Bowling for
Columbine, for the next 3 reasons: - Fact too easily was mixed with
fiction. - The idea and conclusion of the 'documentary' were unclear. -
Michael Moore is an annoying brat.Now, although it is impossible to deny Moore still is that annoying and
self-indulgent brat, Fahrenheit 9/11 makes sense, is clear in it's
opinion and conclusion and is a work of some good journalism. Heck, I'd
even call it a real documentary.Moore makes no mistake about this one: he hates Bush. He hates
everything he stands for. He hates the fact Bush is America's first
representative. So he hates everything the guy does, whether he's just
to do so or not.So Moore uncovers some facts about the relationship between the Bin
Ladens and the Bushes, makes clear a lot of people in office are there
just because they're friends or partners of Double-Ya and finally
concludes his story about the unjust war the coalition troops are
fighting in Iraq.Sometimes Moore overplays his hand. Like when Bush is hearing the news
of the attack while sitting in a classroom, reading to little kids. We
see him ponder what just happens, there's a glimpse of disbelief in his
eyes... but then, who wasn't in shock and disbelief that morning (or
afternoon in these parts). I can't see why *that* would make him a bad
president.Or the meeting Bush has a couple of days after the attacks, with the
Saudi ambassador... it seems to me that would be an intelligent thing
to do, to keep the Saudi's close and to make sure to get their help
when trying to hunt down Bin Laden.But otherwise, Moore has learned his lesson from 'Columbine' and for
most of the time sticks with the facts. Now, although I would love to
hear him explain how he thinks Iraq, or for that matter, the world
would look like if Saddam was still in charge, I understand it's just
his job to uncover some of the lies the Bush administration have told
the citizens of America. And in some ways, he's getting that job done.7/10.

On the brink of war, documentary director Michael Moore, a man whose
become synonymous with many labels depending on which political party
you belong to, creates his next outrageous documentary/ expose which
leans towards the left and garnered many a controversy.Exposing the motives behind the Iraq-American war from the United
States, Moore manages to give a disturbing and rather intriguing look
at the intentions behind the war, the intentions we were told, and what
really happened while showing the things the news never shows, the
suffering of the families of the soldiers, how Iraq is suffering just
as much and maybe more than we are during this senseless conflict.I've never been much of a fan of Moore; he's an manipulative
opportunist and "Bowling for Columbine" was a documentary with much
potential that trailed into different topics, but Moore hits the mark
with "Fahrenheit 9/11". Yes, you may suspect what my political leanings
are by this review, and you may be right or wrong, but I won't tell
straight out, because I don't want it to cloud my feelings for this
movie. Whether or not this is a good documentary will not come into
play. Whether or not this is a good movie depends on whether you
support Bush or not.Now first off, there were just so many scenes during this that I felt
were so strategically placed and out of context to prove Moore's point
including some scenes involving Bush and some badly timed comments and
jokes that, while not funny, seem to be put to make him come out in a
less than positive light to the audience and it made me feel
manipulated to buy what Moore was selling. Also, Moore continues in his
least subtle more outrageous method of getting to his points by walking
Capitol Hill and Washington asking senators to enlist their children to
the military and by renting an Ice Cream truck reading the homeland
security guidebook. Moore can get his points across in less outlandish
ways, but then it wouldn't be a Michael Moore documentary if he didn't
commit those acts, would it?Moore, who remained extra careful this time around hiring lawyers and a
large team of fact checkers paints a portrait of a man who wasn't fit
for presidency taking us to war because A) his family has ties to the
Bin Laden's so we went to war with the easy target Iraq, and B) because
he was an under-achiever attempting to live up to his father's career.
It's safe to assume Bush does not come off well here depicted as a
trigger happy cowboy, back stabbing worm, and a man incapable of
running an organization let alone a country running three oil countries
to the ground yet still remained an executive because of his
connections.Moore shows the footage right at the beginning of the documentary of
9/11 where Bush was at a classroom reading with the students, he's told
of the attack, and he sits for seven minutes with a grim expression.
Moore meanwhile attempts to discover what was going through his head
which looks a lot like horror, confusion and shock that his job just
became serious. Moore manages to bring across an electric theme of
tragedy, conspiracy and satire through funny mock commercials, witty
narration (Moore only appears here in four short segments), and
subtitles that undermine what a politician might point out.Meanwhile, he brings to the audience some insight on the government and
their ties to other corporations and the obvious tampering of the polls
to elect Bush to office, the government's dismissal of minorities who
insist Bush wasn't elected honestly, not to mention he points out the
government's method in instilling fear into American citizens in order
to control them and their tampering of documents and taking away of our
civil liberties in order to "protect us" from the bad terrorist men.
Protection doesn't come through control, it comes through cooperation,
something Moore states that the government is unwilling to abide by.
Moore shows a government that wants to control the country and used the
war as a stepping stone in doing so.Moore gives some really brisk film-making while explaining many points
of the underlying themes of racism through recruiting as in cornering
people in low class neighborhoods less like recruiters and more like
car salesmen and we watch two recruiters joking and laughing at
minorities as they pass them and declare them as marks giving them
every reason why they should join even telling one person that the
marines could help with their music career. Regardless of which
political party you belong to, watch this documentary and become
enlightened before you bash it or praise it.Moore doesn't only criticize our government's sketchy handling of 9/11
but he also manages to point out how insanely paranoid we are with one
deputy in a small town sending a spy to infiltrate a small peace group.
They weren't extremist hippies, just people like you and I who ate
cookies and discussed politics, not to mention Moore exposes a
government that's lost its priorities and bases its affairs more
financially than what's important to its citizens.We've become a nation of people who fear and worry based on ridiculous
routines such as the color coded bar which is basically useless. Moore
does manage to reveal some interesting and astute points that, if
you've followed politics intensely, will ring true. Now, as for his
statement that the press is behind the government, I'd say they're more
like that kid in the school yard that follows anyone as long as it
means he'll be popular, they lean anywhere because it's all about the
ratings.We also get to witness the suffering of people who really matter:
families of the soldiers who went to Iraq, and families from Iraq who
suffer everyday. We witness soldiers who were painted a pretty picture
of war and some whom approach the war like a video game in some rather
disturbing images, and realize they're really there for nothing and
want to go home. Moore paints a portrait of many layers as we watch a
mother suffering with the death of her son and appears at Washington to
make peace and cry but is greeted with ignorance from witnesses. We see
the usual shock footage Moore shows to bring across his point with most
recent videos of Iraqi horror and we have to wonder if the violence was
already there or did we just tempt them into aggression? Though, the ending gives no clear answer, it will bring about some
sense of enlightenment hopefully and this is one of Moore's better more
insightful documentaries in his career. The really good part of the DVD
features despite the contents that hilariously spoof the utter
senseless terrorist color meter, is the special ten minute segment
profiling Arab comedians who have their very own tour mocking the
misery they've encountered post 9/11. Though their misery during the
last two years regarding name calling and being profiled as terrorist
threats are horrible, they manage to make light of it with some very
funny comedy, and that makes them real survivors.(***half out of ****)

People often wonder why citizens of others nations don't like America.
They think that we are envious or selfish or not understanding or
simply prone to hatred. They say that we should hold ourselves
fortunate because they saved us from the Germans. Not from the Nazis,
though, since a few studies show how private interests (such as the
Bush family's, among others) were pretty friendly with the bad guys in
those times. But what went wrong with the Germans, after all? Look at
them now, there are pretty decent guys in fact. What went wrong is that
they happened to find themselves in such a political and social crisis,
that when a loony with a lot of 'good ideas' took over the power, they
just followed. His ideas were great. Hitler fought unemployment, he
created housing and wealth, build amazing Autostrasse, offered free
education to the youth And in order to boost the economy, he went into
massive colonialist war. 80 million smart people followed him, without
a second thought. Sixty years later, beyond the Atlantic ocean, we have
a very similar settings. A loony is promising jobs and wealth,
advocating the virtues of Christianity, and even promising that he'll
take care of our retarded kids. The price to pay is the same: massive
colonialist pseudo- righteous wars. 300 millions people follow without
a second thought It is not about the Americans. We've got nothing
against them. They're pretty decent guys after all.Freedom a speech is a wonderful liberty, but is there much more than
half a dozen guys that make proper and decent use of it? Michael Moore
does, as well as Mike, Mikey, Mickey and a couples clone of M.Moore.
Anybody else has got something to say? Speak louder, please, we can't
hear you.

I think this film show what we have already know but not have clues. I
have already heard about the relationship between Bin Laden and America
but this film answers most of the questions in my head.Every American citizen and also every Muslim people must see this film.Finally I want to say that Muslim can't be terrorist, terrorist can't
be Muslim. I think no Muslim heart can stand the violence over the
innocent people. The violence for only making big money.As a Turkish citizen I live with terror caused by PKK or KONGRA-GEL. In
our eastern parts of our country still terror continues. Every day a
Turkish troop is murdered. Terror lost its temper but still goes on.
However American Government does not define PKK or KONGRA-GEL as a
terror group.

No one can be lukewarm about this movie. Depending on their political
affiliations, people will either love it or hate it. I thought it was
powerful, shocking, and accurate. Although some people have criticized
the movie for being biased, I find it closely follows information that
has been available since 9/11 in books, newspapers, magazine articles,
and news programs. In other words, the bias in this documentary comes
from people in the Bush administration, not Michael Moore. They have
condemned themselves with their own careless words and actions. He has
merely documented it for all to see. Michael Moore has done us all a
service for conflating a massive amount of information into a coherent
account of what, after all, is the truth. I was stunned by some of the
information that hasn't been shown us by the media; for example, the
egg throwing and demonstration against George W. Bush in his limousine
on the way to his inauguration. I'm beginning now to believe what I've
heard about the media being supressed or biased in its reporting. A
great documentary which I can't praise highly enough, and I have been
phoning everyone I know to go and see it.

Art is truly something that inspires thought and emotion. Nothing in
2004 (less some small arguments for Passion of the Christ) embodies
this more than Fahrenheit 9/11. I applaud Michael Moore for something
rather frightening when it comes down to it... simply exercising his
right as an American to freedom of speech. This film beautifully blends
the facts, along with Michael Moore's humour, and comedy by George W.
that tops a lot of the stand up acts touring these days. It is a great
feeling that in a time that ideas are suppressed in the sake of
security from terror, that such a voice can continue a tradition of
free speech. I can only hope aspiring filmmakers and voices out there
will continue on with the tradition and provoke free ideas and speech
beyond just one voice.

Our founding fathers were wealthy land barons who systematically
exterminated an entire race of people who they found living on the soil
that they wanted to possess. It has never changed. Men of power and
wealth have always sought to protect their status at all costs, even if
it meant going to war and sacrificing other peoples children. Michael
may have a chip on his shoulder, but it is a valid one. The Saudi's and
the Bush's have been sleeping with each other and screwing us for far
too long. Why does another country own 7% of ours? A revolution is
needed but the sheep are asleep in the field. Pacified by
pseudo-reality TV. All of the news organizations are owned by those
same men so how can they possibly be impartial. For a change this film
is not just entertainment it is an education. I am an American veteran
from the Vietnam era. That war was wrong and so is this one. Bravo Mr.
Moore.

Too often we are exposed to news broadcasts that are edited and
polished to assist in making The President look strong and capable, but
Michael Moore finally shows us the other side. While the only true
complaints that I have heard is that Moore is only presenting one side
of the story, it should be said that it simply offsets the crap that we
have been dished out for the last 4 years since Bush's "election". I am
a Canadian who sees the U.S. as a great country with great people who
are lied and used by rich, corrupt politicians who only use them to
obtain power. After you watch Farenheit 9/11, I think you will get the
needed evidence for you to believe the same. Good job Michael. It's
great to know that someone actually cares about spreading a little
truth to counter-act all the lying.

Despite Michael Moore's obvious dislike for the Bush Family, this film
is as focused as you can get. The proof is in the statements made by
the administration themselves. This was not a soup box film, but an
expose' of what many of us KNOW to be true.Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this film MAKES YOU THINK,
and I mean THINK FOR YOURSELF. Never mind what the media or spin
doctors spin. This has been going on for decades.Most importantly, I have make mention of the quality that Moore put
into this documentary. You would never know that this was the same guy
who sounded off with the words "Shame On You George Bush" at last years
academy awards. Moore appeared to maintain a steady hand in allowing
the footage and the interviews speak for themselves. I almost felt as

The movie is a great documentary work. I recommend seeing it regardless
of your political views. This is a film that intends to reach a
political influence. Most of the claims that were made by the director
Michael Moore were documented and shown to the viewers, and some are
arbitrary comments.The audience in the movie theather has been very emotional during
seeing it.I heard sounds of wonder, support cheers to Moor's
statements, After walking out of the theater I heard very intense
discussions and debates of what was seen and understood. I think that a
real bloody scenes in the movie does not justified the rated 'R' . I
think young population has the right and justification to see it. Enjoy the movie, it's a thrilling seen.

Ben Franklin once said "Those that can give up essential liberty to obtain a
little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."  I think this
quote does a great job of summing up a lot of our nation's problems these
days.  After the terrorist attack of September 11th, the United States as a
whole was scared.  What resulted was the giving up of freedoms so that we
would feel safe from these evil terrorists.Michael Moore looks at how the Bush Administration, in his eyes, has used
fear to push its agenda forward.  Now while this is a very topical issue and
this film is a must-see, there is a problem.  Much of America won't see this
film based on principle.  Conservatives don't want to go see the Republican
President and his polices bashed for two hours.  I in no way want to take
sides in this argument or talk down at either side of the political
spectrum, but there is a point.People need to stop being so narrow-minded.  This is a very important film
about the leaders of our country, whether you agree with Mr. Moore (a lot of
people don't) or you are a huge Bush supporter (a lot of people aren't). 
This film should be viewed by everyone, no matter where you are on the
political spectrum because it is so important to know what the people you
trust to lead your country are doing."Fahrenheit 9/11" combines news clips, stock footage and new stuff shot by
Moore to bring his monster to life.  The film is very entertaining and very
thought provoking, to say the least.Michael Moore's view is obviously skewed and this is something he doesn't
deny.  If he had it his way Bush would be out of office already, or better
yet wouldn't have been in office at all.  But what he does here, much like
"Bowling for Columbine" is bring up important issues and present the facts
that go along with them.  Some will argue that these facts aren't too
factual, and sure Moore will try to make things sound better for his
perspective, but Mr. Moore is a good film maker and also a very good
investigator.This is a film that should be seen by everyone, the sad thing is that this
is a film that won't be seen by everyone.  Whether you like Moore or you
hate him, I recommend you at least watch the movie and then draw your own
conclusions.  At least have an open mind and see what people have to say,
that's what this country was built on.8 out of 10.

Michael Moore is a rabble-rouser, and usually I find him a little
annoying. However, I was very impressed by Fahrenheit 911. It's very
good. I think it will win the Best Feature Documentary Oscar next year.
I've been trying to figure out where Michael Moore might be lying in
this movie, and I can't find anyplace. As you can tell from the title
of this Web site, the facts do matter to me. Now, there are one or two
places where he doesn't say something he should have (the pipeline
thing, for example, which is still in limbo, or that Saudi Arabia,
Afghanistan and Iraq were and are all dictatorships). But I really
couldn't catch him on much. From a movie-making point of view, he's constructed a pretty tight
film that makes all the right points. A few scenes run on a little
long, but the editing is generally pretty good. I only had a couple of
problems with it.* While he doesn't hesitate to show badly injured Iraqis (and, at least
once, an American soldier), he made a point of not showing anything of
the towers coming down - only dust and paper - or any injured
Americans. As a result, Fahrenheit 911 has a funny National Geographic
feel - we can show the awful physical suffering of "natives" but not
Americans - it would be too offensive. The movie should have been a
little less graphic, because a few of the scenes of injured Iraqis are
quite horrific. That said, he doesn't talk specifically about the
prisoner abuse scandal, but does show some Americans playing with a
corpse and having their pictures taken with captured, hooded Iraqis.* At one point, an injured soldier does say that the war changed him
from a Republican to a Democrat. However, Moore then fails to say that
it's not just poor people who wind up joining the Army - it's the
politically disenfranchised. A shocking number of people do not vote.What Michael Moore does particularly well is "connecting the dots." I
don't think I learned anything new from Fahrenheit 911, I was reminded
of many things that I'd forgotten. He's also grown as a filmmaker - as
he makes more complicated movies, he takes himself out of the movie. He
only shows up in about five shots during the whole thing, and he really
doesn't narrate as much of the film as you might expect. Instead, he
lets the interviewees make most of the points.When I got back to the Internet after the movie, one of the first
things I saw was this:U.S. Mulling How to Delay Nov Vote in Case of Attack*sigh* Michael Moore is sounding more like Paul Revere all the time.
And the danger is from our own government rather than from an outside
source.

Is this movie partisan? Yes, of course it is. However slanted Mr.
Moore's views may be though, the vast majority of data given in this
movie can be corroborated simply by reading the paper every day. I read
the NY Times every afternoon, and I was well aware of most of the
information given in this movie prior to watching it. While I agreed
with the general message given in Bowling for Columbine, much of it was
stretched a bit thin. However, fact checkers will have a hard time
disproving information in F9/11. This information has always been out
there-- if you don't keep up with the news everyday (not the bogus
local news, of course), you should check out this movie... It might be
quite enlightening!

Just saw the movie last night and I got out with an immense feeling of
sadness. I had the same feeling the day US attacked Iraq out of Bush's
personal agenda, even though UN inspectors said that there were no WMD
in there.I am not quite sure why some people hate this movie so much. For me, it
is just an exercise of freedom of speech. Most of the stuff that is in
the movie was in the media at one point or another, though this
government tried to play so much the card "If you're not with us,
you're against us" that not even media dared to criticize Bush after
9/11. It's a pity that there are not that many media people like Moore.
And about taking things out of context by cut and paste: I think that
what Moore did was put things into context! As we could see in the
beginning of the movie, letting everybody see the uncut version of the
"Leader of the World"'s response to a crisis situation does not do him
any good! I actually think that it's much more to be said about Bush's
lame performance as a president...I think it was pretty smart for Moore that he took a second place in
the movie and tried to present the change of mind regarding the war in
Iraq through the story of Lila Lipscomb from Flint, MI. Even though
some people were bothered by that: that's what war is about! And it's
even worse when you realize that people die for lies.

After reading many of the F9/11 reviews (extremely positive to
extremely negative) and hearing the pundits claims of Michael Moore's
distortions and unpatriotic slant, I had to see this movie just to see
why it was receiving so much hype. In fact, I had to see it twice
because I don't think those who are criticizing it really saw the
movie. They rant and rave but have not refuted much of the information
presented. Much of what they do refute, I didn't even see in the movie.
As a moderate Republican who has lost any hope that G. W. Bush would
govern as a moderate, I found Moore's presentation of the last four
years under this President to be very factual, emotional and powerful.
Were parts of the movie selective and biased? Sure it was. But even so,
how can any rational person come away not seeing how dishonest and
unethical this administration has become under the guise of protecting
America. I recommend this movie to everyone with an open mind and
concerned about this country's direction.

Mr. Moore has a bit of a negative bias toward the Bushes.(Understatement of the month) As such, he probably exaggeratedand presented one side of many issues. There may be someunsubstantiated assertions. Let's face it; he may not have passedthe "fair and balanced" standard of our beloved FoxNews. Buthere's what's scary to me: if only 25 to 30 per cent of what themovie portrays is true, we have a major problem!  What's worst isthat it is our fault (the US electorate). Moore rubs our noses in it for122 uncomfortable minutes.If a movie is judged on how well it makes its point, I should havegiven Moore's masterpiece a "10." I didn't; maybe I should re-vote."Fahrenheit 9/11" may not make Democrats out of thinkingConservatives, but one has to be blindly on the far right not torealize that we have elected an unworthy occupant of the WhiteHouse, to put it mildly.

It seems that the comments made about this movie are permeated by the
insatiable human need to critique. It has been said that those who can
do, while those who cannot criticize. The anomaly, Michael Moore, does
by criticizing. Criticism has a function in the right hands. Fahrenheit
9/11 shows this.The diversity of perception by viewers is apparent in the love and hate
generated by the different scenes and by the film its self. Some think
the part about Lila was effective, others think it weakened the
structure or manipulated the audience. The talk about whether this is a
documentary, op ed piece, propaganda, etc. is typical of the human
instinct to classify. It is a useless discussion. View the film as a
challenge to the senses and sensibilities. It has a function that is to
vote Bush out. Effective sequencing shows the cruelty of life of man,
the corruption of Bush of government and the pain inflicted. From the earliest civilizations to now men have sought to enrich
themselves on the weakened backs of their subordinates. But greed for
money and power is quantitative and men legislate it to different
degrees of perversity. The current administration is a particularly
greedy cabal, and it uses effective techniques of persuasion and
manipulation to control and extend its reign. Our beloved reactionary
conservatives share the advertising industry's method of screaming the
message continually until the desired result is obtained. The result in
this case being the duping of the populace. The democrats are generally
a less corrupt option, but our system of concentrated wealth and power
is invariably unfair. Only future generations of education, concerned
action and eventual enlightenment will complete the equality of man.
Fahrenheit 9/11 and the positive reaction to it is one step forward in
the march of humanity. 10 out of 10 on the strength of entertainment, content and humanistic
intent.

A must see movie. Go see it. It does not matter what party you are,
this movie demands to be seen. It put a few tears in my eyes. That's
how emotional it is.It amazed me how many facts was used. I really thought it was going to
be Moore ranting, but it really was more fact than rant. Lots and lots
of TV clips. Bush was given a fair deal in this movie. I know that Moore is one sided, but I have to admit that he has changed
my mind. Please see the movie with an open mind. It is not fair to
label Mr. Moore before you see his work.Chris.

The reviews had indicated that this was good, but not worthy of the
Cannes top honour, so I went prepared to be somewhat disappointed --
not so! From start to finish, this riveting, astoundingly informative
film absolutely took my breath away. This is a film every adult should
see, regardless of whether you're American or not; but Americans, most
definitely, need to be educated as to what is (and has) taken place at
the most powerful & trusted level of government. Moore, as usual,
manages to temper the hard facts with an edge of humour at times; which
in itself seems an incredible task given the serious subject matter.
Absolutely the best documentary (and one of the very best movies) I've
ever seen; the kind of film that one wants to call everyone you know
and tell them "you HAVE TO go see THIS!!!"

This film moved me to tears with its reminders of all this country
suffered in 9/11 and its aftermath. But I felt tremendous relief to see
that somebody is actually combining the available information about how
our lawmakers/leaders have been dealing with the aftermath. Many of the
*revelations* had been available from the media, but only in tiny bytes
and never with enough discussion. Michael Moore put it all together and
gave us a film that raises questions about motives, abilities, and
priorities that have been directing our country's actions since 9/11.
It is said that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. *Fahrenheit
9/11* is on the side of vigilance. Excellent.

I loved this movie and I think it will finally opened the American
people's eyes as to how our idiot president is ruining this country,
and what his interests really are! This movie was a well-put together
and well-thought out documentary that shows how one idiot can ruin
millions of lives. I hope this documentary affects the presidential
election of 2004. Also, I don't care what anyone says, Mike Moore did
not use editing to bias this documentary. Nothing was scripted. The
scenes with the president were straight from his mouth. I give Mike
Moore two thumbs up for this movie. In my opinion it is so far the best
movie of the year and everyone needs to see it.

Whether you are liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, Bush
hater or Bush lover, go see the film. Michael Moore presents enough
stimulating information to encourage critical thinking. And left out
plenty that could have been said. If you doubt the information, go home
and research it to see if it's true or not. The internet (which you
must have if you are reading this) is full of information on all the
controversies in this film. The best aspect of this film is that it
makes people think. As a nation, I feel that we are too complacent. And
that is dangerous. As Hitler once said, "What good fortune for those in
power that people do not think." Too bad we can't ask G.W.'s granddaddy
Preston about that...after all, he financed the Nazi party until the US
government made him stop. And so the legacy continues.See the film. THINK. As they say, knowledge is power.

I have viewed the film/documentary with an open mind and without bias,
yet, did it ever move me. Reeling 2 years of misery for the people of
the Middle East and Americans into the bloodied hands of an American
President in under 2 hours was no easy feat. Facts upon facts were
presented in a masterfully made documentary had more credence to truth
and justice then the 8 year's America suffered under the yoke of a
false president. A man that has brought fallacy and dishonour to the
American people. A powerful, very thought provoking documentary.
Michael Moore's master stroke is in nurturing throughout the film a
sense of hope. For the American dream beats steady in the hearts of
every American, that the idea of 'the land of the free' is ever more
alive in its people. I too share that dream, I believe, it is a common
right to all people of this fair earth even in this most dreary of
times.I have to disagree to certain opinions that the film was a personal
attack to discredit the current President, to be dismissed as a rash
political propaganda featurette. Ask oneself what is Michael to gain if
he was hell bend to do so? This documentary in my humble opinion is the
act of a man that has seen both sides of the story, and through
personal strive concluded that as a man of principles and wisdom, could
only be pushed too far. The facts could not be swept under the carpets
anymore, let the people of America decide what is best for America; to
fall from grace in the hands of a false president OR wrest freedom,
democracy back to make it their own and share peace and not war for all
mankind.I guess Americans that flock to the cinemas for this
documentary and made it no#1 in the box office had made a choice. and
Guess what? to vote for a credible president in America cost less that
the admission ticket! Its free!I give it 9/10!

there are many things in this movie that you will not see on CNN or
your local news broadcast, open your eyes, see the movie.I'm sure most of the 1 and zero ratings for this movie are from people
who have not even bothered to see the movie. Remember this is a
documentary and of course the editing and choice of video shown will be
biased towards what Moore wants you to see. However just take it for
face value. if you do not see this movie and rely only on what you see
on regular commercial television then you really are limiting your view
of what has gone on in the White House during the current Bush era.
Hopefully the full version of the documentary will be out on DVD before
November

F9/11 is not new information for those who do some reading and kept
uptodate on many points of view on 9/11 and the aftermath. Yet the
movie excellently takes a snapshot in time, roughly from 2001 to 2004
and shows us plainly and elegantly a very plausible sequence of events. Regular media tends to forget what was promised or said by Bush, and
never holds them accountable for their claims. This movie says, lookie
here, you said this and that, and it simply wasn't true. This movie
also says there's more to it than meets the eye and proceeds to show
regular people what connections rich and powerful people (Bush and the
Saudis) have, and also how poor Americans are recruited to go and kill
other poor people on the other side of the earth. This is an important
"fact" that the media just ignores.As a Canadian, I am thrilled to see a popular American film which is
not only thoughtful, but is willing to look just beyond the veneer. I
have always had faith in the average American's humanity, but was aware
that they were never knowledgeable about what else might be going on,
beyond what the TV told them.Anita

The opening scenes, the closing comments, the interviews with American
and Iraqi victims were very moving. The film's interspersed humor kept
it from becoming a dirge. The footage of Bush revealed him as being
even worse as a human being and as a national leader than I had
realized. I loved the expressions on the faces of the two members of
Congress (and their aides) that Moore interviewed on the street (about
what? go see the movie!) His treatment of the 'coalition' forces was a
bit superficial.I plan to go see the movie again, and am glad it is a financial
success. I do think Moore should keep himself off screen more.

It took someone like Michael Moore to finally come out in all his
blazing audacity to present to the American people how they have been
burying their heads in the sand about our glorious leader. I recently
wrote criticizing Reagan (Reagan Tributes-Enough Already! June 13th,
2004) and said that even with Reagan's blighted record, I would still
rather have him than 'Herr Bush'.'Fahrenheit 9/11' ventures into territory only suggested or hinted at
by the other media. No one had the balls to say it like it really is.
In fact, I thought Moore's film had in fact been somewhat kind to 'Der
Fuhrer' when considering the damage he has done to America and it's
image around the world. There is hardly a country on the planet where
Bush is not despised, laughed at, or held in awe that such an obvious
asshole could be the president of the mightiest land in the world. And
let us not forget his blessed cabinet, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld,
Rice and the worst choice of all, John Ashcroft. Each one of these gems
could be fodder for another film by themselves. Anyway, don't get me
started.Moore's film is perhaps the wakeup call America needs in these chaotic
times. Of course, I could criticize the mechanics of the film such as
the editing, directing, etc., but I will not. The film makes a powerful
statement on how things are and that I will not sully. The people who
saw the movie laughed, they cried, they fumed, and they cheered for
what the man was trying to communicate and that should be enough said
by itself. It took a lot of courage to defy the wrath of the ridiculous
right by presenting Bush and his gang of thieves as they really are
without whitewashing them Hollywood style.This could be the 'shot heard 'round the world' and indeed it has been
setting all sorts of box office records for a documentary film. It is
something that really needed to be said and said right now. The press
has been remarkably silent and ignoring Bush's betrayal of his country,
his incessant lying, and his ineptness in office. The special interests
Bush has been serving, such as 'Big Oil' and the Bin Laden family has
finally been given the exposure they have so richly deserved. It is now
up to the American people to shout "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going
to take it anymore.' (Made famous in the old movie 'Network' in 1976).I have heard criticism from other reviewers that the film presents
certain matters as though they are true without any support in fact.
Obviously, the reviewer either has not really seen the film or is so
taken in by the propaganda that they cannot or will not believe that
such a blatant abuse of power could exist in this country. Well I have
news for you. It can exist and it does exist and you better get aboard
and do something about it.The power has always been in the people; however, when they choose not
to use it, the 'evil empire' will fill the void with its own special
interests and take the rights and freedoms that were earned by the
people away from them again. I sincerely hope we heed this wakeup call
and not go back to complacency and apathy. We each have the power vote
this fall, get rid of this idiot in the White House, and have a real
'Regime Change' for the better. Outstanding Mr. Michael Moore!

One need not agree with all of Moore's perspectives in "Fahrenheit
9/11" to be shocked and awed by the footage in the film that the
supposedly liberal media have not shown us. The mainstream media have
done the American people a great disservice in these times. It has been
left to a gadfly to deliver to the public images and information that
counterbalance the myopic view offered by the administration and the
corporate media conglomerates. Some scenes are heartbreaking as we are
exposed to the effects that this war has had on the lives of both
Iraqis and Americans alike. Other scenes reveal character flaws and odd
behavior in our current leadership by using material normally cut out
of the evening news. This film is as much an indictment of the
mainstream media as of George W. Bush.

First off, you're either going to love this movie, or you're going to
hate it. Personally, I love it. Those who hate it are supporters of
King George, who believe this "fictitious war" really has merit, that
believe G.W. Bush is doing everything he can to end terrorism with his
War on Terror, which, like the War on Drugs, it will never end.Besides shedding light on the 9/11 and the war in Iraq, the film
contains everything American cinema-goers love: comedy (at Bush's
expense), violence (at Iraq and the U.S.'s expense), and drama (at the
world's expense).This film documents the the events leading up to 9/11, and the sudden
urge of our fearful leader to attack a nation that has never even been
a threat to this great land. It puts the Bush administration into true
light -- showing the absolute (yes, even if it is bias) truth.There's a new documentary coming out called "Michael Moore Hates
America," if you see this movie, you'll see that is false, that Michael
probably loves this country more than any other American.If you really love this country, the good IL' U.S. Of A., see this
movie, even if your politics differ from that of Michael Moore's. It's
always good to see all perspectives of those events the chronicle our
history and our society. Even if you leave the theater hating Michael
Moore, at least you learned something, even if it doesn't echo your own
sentiments.

Outstanding movie. Everyone in America should see it. We should all
take a lesson from being so easily manipulated into war and
surrendering our individual rights. I feel I should apologize to every
soldier in Iraq (including one who is my cousin).Bush and Company led us down the "primrose path" but we allowed
ourselves to be led, without asking questions or engaging in any
critical thought about the justifications they gave us for the invasion
of Iraq. Bush tied everything except the weather to Al Qaeda and if
anyone questioned it he branded them unpatriotic. We are headed down
the path to ruin with this administration. Wake up America!!! God help
us if he gets re-elected.

I'm tired of the liberal whining about the biased nature of this
"documentary." Argue until you're blue about semantics but this is
bigger, and more important than that. This film is not to be critiqued
as a "documentary" - it's an op-ed piece- and it should be seen as an
important cultural event. It's a bonding opportunity for lefties and
Bush-opponents world-wide. It's an opportunity for the world to see
that there IS dissent here, we are NOT apathetic, and there are people
wanting change. Thinking people the world over should see this film and
flaunt it's outrageousness. George W. Bush is a humiliation that we can
not passively accept! Michael Moore should be commended for realizing
our collective grief and frustration and rage! He's encapsulated, in
two wildly compelling hours, everything that we hate about this current
administration.He had the balls to stand up and invite us to gather and share in our
collective outrage. Thank you, Michael Moore. You've done a great

In a time when the media delivers news based on sensation, as opposed to
accuracy, Michael Moore brings us his new expose on the Bush Administration,
`Fahrenheit 9/11.' Like such news organizations, Moore's film is biased.
However, Moore's film actually substantiates its arguments with accurate
information that Moore, himself, cites throughout the film. It is one of the
most compelling and utterly shocking films that I ever seen. The debate as
to whether or not the Bush Administration was incompetent prior to and after
September 11, 2001 has more or less been answered. The real question is
whether or not the viewers of the film will believe it-in the end, this
film's truth or fallacy will be a choice of the viewer.	`Fahrenheit 9/11' opens on the problems with the 2000 election. Moore cites
that Al Gore won the popular and the electoral vote, however, as Fox News
was the first to report Bush won the election due to the Florida vote. At
this point, Moore points out that many minority votes were miscounted or
misrepresented in many other states. Moore then points out that Bush spent
over 40% of his first year in office on vacation. 
	Then September 11 happened. Moore sensitively portrays the events by not
showing pictures, but by darkening the screen and allowing simply the sounds
of the event play out. Moore shows the human reaction-people's faces and
their responses. It is at this point that revelations begin about the Bush
Administration: from allowing the Bin Laden family the ability to leave the
country when all planes in the U.S. were grounded to the slow response of
going after Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, allowing him time to flee.Moore feels that the greatest flub of this administration was that of the
Iraq war. He cites that the Bush Administration was hell-bent on going after
Saddam Hussein, not so much to liberate Iraq from the clutches of a vile
dictator or for weapons of mass destruction which simply were not there, but
for oil. Moore points this out by showing videos from various meetings of
oil companies and their enthusiasm over future ventures in Iraq. What's more
is that Moore draws the parallels between rich Saudi Arabian oil
billionaires and the former and present Bush Administration. It is Moore's
feeling that this whole war, like most in modern history, was about
generating profits. 
	Moore spends a good portion of the film exploring the U.S. military and the
events they witnessed and took part in Iraq. Moore points out that much of
the military is made up of young men and women from lower income districts
of the country, making known that the military is one of the only options
for these people to escape poverty. Indeed it is a good move, Moore would
agree, if the military was not fighting what he feels is in unjustified war.
Moore points out the heavy budget cuts to veterans that the Bush
Administration has allowed to occur. Furthermore, Moore takes the step of
actually approaching Congressmen and Senators in Washington, D.C. and asking
them if they support the war, and if so, would they consider encouraging
their own children to join the military and fight in Iraq. Most of the
officials simply look at Moore as if he were crazy to ask-after all, why
should the rich and powerful send their children to fight when the poor can
for them? 
It is undeniable that Moore takes a few cheap shots at Bush himself in the
film-how can anyone not, G.W. is an easy target. However, it cannot be
denied that Moore has done his homework here and delivered the American
people a documentary that criticizes its leaders with accurate information
concerning their own failures in running the United States. Moore is an
American and deeply proud of his country-that is why he has made this film.
He cares about the future of this country and he will not stand down to what
he feels is wrong. **** out of ****

I just finished seeing this documentary and was not entirely surprised,
maybe because in Europe we have seen the images that were filtered out
in the United States. I think it's educational, and hope everyone
watches it and remembers it all in November, when it really matters.
Also I'd like to comment on the remark made by Tarantino as judge of
the Cannes film festival, when asked about the movie, he said that they
didn't reward it because of the politics but because it was a good
movie, cinematographically speaking, which I personally think is a lame
excuse, this movie isn't a masterwork in that sense, but it is a great
eyeopener therefore positive in more than one way, and it deserves
recognition for that.

Some of Moore's finest work here, in that he lets the images and
interviewees tell the story, and skillfully edits the result. The message is
powerful and impossible to ignore.However, it won't matter. Moore is probably hoping to influence the coming
election, but:First, the election is several months away and Americans have notoriously
short attention spans. Plus they shut out things they don't want to hear,
which is of course how Bush managed to win Florida in the first place;Second, the people who really need to see this film, the Bush supporters,
won't. Or if they do, they nit pick and dismiss the whole
thing.Just look at the voting and the user comments. I have never seen such
polarity. The votes are either tens or ones. The comments from the people
who hated the film are from people who had already decided they were going
to hate it.For example, a Republican friend of mine has vowed never to see a Moore film
because he doesn't want to give "that guy" any money. He won't open his mind
for a minute to let a new idea creep in.Another example -- in my town, only one theater out of a dozen is showing
this movie. It was pulled from another one. What do they fear? This theater
is doing great business showing this film, and people were laughing, crying,
and cheering throughout.Yes Moore is making a lot of money from this. Yes it is an opinion piece.
Yes he may be off on a fact or two. Who cares? There are more than enough
facts here to bury Bush if anyone wants to listen.The truly frightening part is, this was all public information. Moore just
brought it out. Why is anyone shocked about it now? Why is Bush still a
popular president?Answer: the media reports what we and the government wants to hear.  Fox is
a Republican mouthpiece. CNN is better, but not much.PS: this film is not against America, or the troops in Iraq. They are doing
a terrific job in a terrible situation. The whole point of the film is, why
are they there in the first place? Not the Bush rhetoric... the real
reason.

An eye-opener, to be sure. As a moderate conservative, I tried to view
this film with as much objectivity as possible. I've grown weary of the
back-and-forth flame wars that go on between ultra-conservatives and
ultra-liberals in the DC area, and as such, I've tried to expand my
horizons to include liberal points of view, as well.I never really liked George Bush. I didn't feel that he had the salt it
took to run this country. I voted for John McCain in the 2000 primary,
and I voted for Al Gore in the general election. Needless to say, this
film re-affirmed everything I mistrusted about our President; from his
grotesquely unethical ties to the Saudi royal family to his deafening
silence on the morning of September 11 after he learned of the second
airplane strike.I don't particularly care for the film maker, Michael Moore, either. I
think that, beyond the facts he presented, his flagrant attacks on the
President were unnecessary and infantile (although at times, raucously
funny).Overall, I was impressed with the depth and detail of the facts pointed
against the President. The most calming element was that the video
clips of George W. Bush spoke for themselves and needed no
interpretation to grasp what was really going on.I walked into that film a moderate Republican, and I think I walked out
a moderate Democrat.

Just saw the movie with a friend this evening. One word - AWESOME! Sure
Moore takes liberty with some of the video editing to create greater
emotional responses but the facts he lays out are truly damning for the
Bush administration. What's truly funny is that it takes a movie on the
truth to tell Americans and the world what's happening behind the
scenes. We actually had to pay $10 to get the truth. Wow. Free
enterprise right down to the last drop. :-) What's funny is that we get this kind of truth everyday in our news
here in Canada. Our journalists make it their mission to expose
everything the government is doing WRONG - it keeps them in check. It
seems a shame that the US news outlets seem so pre-occupied with the
mighty advertising dollar that they dare not challenge anything the
government pushes out or keeps under wraps. I do hope this movie is an
amazing US success - maybe the $100's of millions of revenue from the
movie will once and for all prove to the networks that indeed there's
money in being investigative vs. only propaganda amplifiers. I think the other great service Moore does for the US is that it
separates the supposed culprits from the regular American citizens.
This helps remove the spotlight of Anti-Americanism away from the
innocent citizen and focuses it on the source of the problem. It helps
to remind us all that we are indeed all the same in the world but a few
bad apples tend to spoil the barrel.This movie is a classic movie of our time. It reminds everyone and
especially Americans that it's your right and your duty to ask
questions and demand accountability. Good for you Michael Moore.
Bravo!!!

Moore relentlessly presents his own take on Iraq, a conflict that in
his eyes is born of fear, deception and confusion and realized in
blood, death and tears, diminishing the American dream it purported to
defend. Moore pointedly questions the premises, goals and "selling" of
the war, its relevance to 9/11 and, most of all, its fearsome costs
both in national resources and human lives. The film isn't objective,
nor does it ever pretend to be. Moore keeps mockingly overstepping the
boundaries while imagining what Bush is thinking, playing up the
president's humor (both conscious and unconscious) and, at one point,
superimposing Bush into the "Bonanza" TV title scene, along with fellow
"Cartwrights" Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Tony Blair.This is a movie often much closer to David Letterman, "Saturday Night
Live" or "Dr. Strangelove"--or a Rush Limbaugh satiric tirade--than to
Ken Burns or "60 Minutes." There's a human voice behind every scene:
joking or occasionally--as in the scenes with bereaved war mother Lila
Lipscomb or Moore's moving paean to America's preponderantly
working-class fighting forces--rising to unexpected heights of grief
and eloquence.Worth watching.

Certainly the best film Michael Moore has made, Fahrenheit 9/11 appears to
take some of its 
style and structure from Errol Morris documentaries. Moore could emulate
worse.Moore has a lot to work with and it shows in the abbreviated attention he
pays to some 
aspects of the events between 2000 - 2003. He is even more abbreviated in
covering GW 
Bush's activities before his inauguration. And, I feel Moore spends too much
time on the 
Bush/House of Saud connections -- something of a non-sequitur.Most people who make documentaries do so because they have a point of view.
Moore's 
point of view is no secret. He uses a mix of vintage movie clips,
well-chosen pop music and 
some musical themes that sound vaguely like Philip Glass (the Errol Morris
influence again, I 
guess) all to good effect. Technically, there are a couple of errors and in a few cases, facts left out
to make a point. 
Neither are entirely forgivable, especially since Moore was publicly spanked
for the 'free rifle' 
setup in "Bowling for Columbine" but I think Moore probably lacks the
perfectionism 
necessary to make a -- pardon the expression -- bulletproof
film.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a powerful film because of what it says and shows, Moore
gets the credit 
for stepping up and tackling the job. In future, maybe a more 'serious'
filmmaker will tackle 
the same subject matter and make a 7 hour film. Moore gets the credit for
keeping F911 
engaging and powerful with moments of levity and a lot of real tragedy.It's sad that so much of this film is going to be a surprise to voters.
There's very little new 
and nothing made up here. But having all of these facts in one place means
this film has the 
power to change the outcome of a Presidential election if it is seen by
enough people. And 
that puts it in the top rank of documentaries -- ever.9/10

Firstly, to all the crapflooders from the "Free Republic" (major
misnomer) who have been crapflooding this review database...bite me.Second: this is a very important movie. I knew everything that was in
the movie, there were no factual surprises, but what hit me the hardest
was seeing the soldier writhing around on the ground with the very
large wound in his leg. Realizing that what I was watching was real,
not special effects or makeup or anything like that, hit me like a gut
punch. Like the Bowie song goes, "It's No Game."I will say this here and now: this should have been rated PG-13. The
biggest obscenities of this movie have nothing to do with the MF word,
and besides, by the time I was in 4th grade we talked dirtier than that
anyway. No, the biggest obscenities are the actions of a small cabal of
people who have hijacked the country I love. The jerk with his movie "Michael Moore Hates America" is totally,
completely wrong. Michael Moore LOVES America. And ultimately F 9/11 is
his love letter to his country and mine. If you love your country, you
will go see this movie with an open mind, without prejudice. And you
will take your children too. By children I mean Middle School or High
Schoolers, not Elementary School children. Elementary School-age kids
are a bit too young for this. But the thing is that military recruiters
are cruising Middle Schools in barrio and ghetto neighborhoods all over
the US looking for children. You can "jine up" as early as Middle
School now...it's called "Delayed Recruitment." I have a neighbor whose
daughter will be going into the Navy after she graduates High School. I
wish I could take her to see this movie. But I suppose we should be
glad that this movie IS being seen here in America now, considering the
current chilly climate for individual rights and liberties.

*Spoilers*I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11 the Sunday after it opened fully expecting to
see Bush get trashed for 122 minutes.  I am a registered Democrat so it's
fair to say that I was looking forward to it as I don't care for Bush or his
politics.  What I wasn't expecting was a film of great cinematic quality see
as it is a documentary.  After briefly going over the unpleasantness of the
2000 election in Florida with all his usual sarcasm and wit, Moore then
moves on to the tragedy of 9/11.  Here is where his cinematic genius begins
to show.Rather than bombard you with images of the planes hitting the twin towers or
the pentagon he chooses to keep the screen blank for about a full minute
while he plays a mixture of audio from the event.  You hear the sounds of
the first plane crashing and the reactions of people on the ground
witnessing this.  The second plane hits and you continue to see only a blank
screen as you listen to the sounds of people reacting.  The screen finally
begins to show the faces of people looking up at the destruction; some are
crying and shouting but most are stunned as most of us were watching at
home.  Finally the scene ends with the dust clouds and thousands of pages of
paper floating in an almost beautiful but eerie way.  Throughout this
segment Moore never once shows the actual buildings being struck or falling
and, as any one who was in the U.S. watching TV that day knows that was
virtually ALL that you saw for about a week.I, like most of us that day, was going about my usual business.  I wasn't
really sure what had happened that day until I got home from my college
classes at about 10:30 am EST and had only really heard that there had a
couple of plane crashes.  I thought that perhaps this was some computer
error or something like that and it wasn't until I saw that BOTH towers and
the Pentagon had been hit that I realized that these had been intentional. 
There is a mild sorrow that you feel upon hearing about a tragic loss of
life.  You don't know any of the people personally but you feel sorry for
the loss and the suffering that their families must be feeling.  When I saw
the totality of the destruction I went from the feeling I have just
described to a kind of dizzy numbness.  It was that feeling where you can't
really believe that what you are seeing is real, like it's a nightmare that
you are almost sure that you will wake up from at any moment.  The idea that
someone could have such raw hatred and disregard for all life that they
could do such a thing was not something that I could immediately wrap my
mind around.I know that I have gone somewhat off of the subject here but I felt it was
necessary to put my feelings from and about that day into words when
commenting on this film.Moore then goes on to expose the actions in the administration that
contributed to the tragedy, the contradictions, mistakes, and lies of the
administration in their rush to go to war wit Iraq, and the outright lack of
respect for human life that went into the initial bombing and the current
subjugation of the Iraqi people.For me there are two scenes that resonate strongly.  The first is the
reaction of the Iraqi people to the deaths caused by the U.S. military's
bombing of their cities.  The second is a scene where Moore is filming a
mother of a soldier who had been killed in Iraq Speaking to an Iraqi woman
one the street in DC who has also lost family in her home land.  As the two
of them are speaking a woman walks up and begins hollering that this is
staged (obviously thinking that the camera is for a news crew) and that they
are lying.  The Mother of the deceased soldier states that her son is dead
and the woman ask her skeptically "Oh yeah? Where did he die?" the mother
tells her Carbala.  The skeptic then brushes it off as if she doesn't care
if it's true or not.Regardless of how you feel about Bush the cinematic beauty and the raw human
emotion of this film make it a must see if only for the sake of satisfying
your curiosity.

Much has been written about this movie - with the Right reviling it
because it "lies" and the rest of the country glad to see some of this
stuff for the first time, and presented in some semblance of
continuity.There is one almost invisible notation that MM makes that is maybe the
most important. I don't remember the exact factoid (I think it was
about the Afghan Pipeline), but MM commented that the specific subject
was not published in any newspaper in the U.S. - but the Brits had it.I found out (due to links posted in an email) even before we attacked
Afghanistan that the BBC and The Guardian were VERY good sources of
info on all of this. At first, I didn't know if I could trust the facts
being presented, but some checking proved to me that I could. As time
went on, I pretty much stopped reading the one-sided pablum that passes
for news in the U.S., and I stayed the course with the British papers
online. The facts are presented objectively, they will call out their
own PM when he deserves it, they don't pull their punches, and when
they say "in-depth interview", by God, they mean tough questions and
staying on the interviewee and don't let him dodge it. Are they wrong
sometimes in their assessments? Certainly! But it is possible to get
more than one side of a story.In comparison, U.S. news media is all a bunch of cheerleading, too
scared to p*** off the Administration for fear of not getting access
the next time around, and known far and wide as "puff" interviewers.Moore, evidently was able to find the same info that HAS BEEN OUT THERE
SINCE BEFORE AFGHANISTAN WAS INVADED.Some news people have said, "But he doesn't present anything new."
Right, not new to them, but a lot of what they knew they didn't think
it was important to tell the U.S. citizenry. So, a lot of people are
getting exposed to this for the first time - by a moviemaker.What does that tell you about the U.S. news media.Yes, shame on Bush, Ashcroft, Cheney, Powell (a good man sucked into a
black hole), Rice, et al.But shame on the Congress for abdicating their responsibilities to be a
check on the Emperor.And shame on the Fourth Estate for cowtowing to liars, cheats and
frauds - and now killers of people in an innocent country.Yes, Iraq is innocent of 9/11. Bush now is telling everybody, "But I
never said that they were in cahoots with al Quaeda!" But he did, as
did all his top sycophants. That is why we invaded Iraq and killed its
people, and pout American boys in harm's way. Because he told us they
were one and the same.WMDs was just his lies to convince us there was a continuing threat.MM tells what we should have been hearing all along - the other side of
the story - the one you had to read British papers to find out.Shame on the U.S. news media.

I WAS SLEEPING FOR A WHILE ... WHAT DID I MISS? 
 I understand the anger that we as Americans feel after the WTC was crashed
into by hijacked airliners killing a few thousand people.  I understand the
pain and fear that we all felt and still feel because of it (although, I of
course cannot fathom what it felt like to lose a loved one in that tragedy).
 I, as much as I am against war, understand wanting to get the people
responsible for it and bringing them to justice.  
I do not understand how going over to Afghanistan and reducing thousands of
innocent people to ash accomplishes that, especially when it was mostly
Saudi Arabians involved in the crashes.  I do not see how sending Americans
over there to die did anything beneficial.  After all, the man who we are
told is responsible is and was nowhere to be found along with most of his
organization and I truly feel that this administration did not expect to
find him in the first place.  I haven't seen Osama smoked out of any holes
but they did conveniently find Saddam in a hole.  
I understand even less where Iraq plays into this.  Is Saddam Hussein the
only madman in the world?  Did he pose a direct threat to the United States?
 Explain to me how it is that Kennedy could present satellite photos of a
missile in Cuba in the 60's and we could not obtain one photo of the dreaded
WMD's in Iraq, in this era of supreme technology we live in.  What is the
real reason we are over there Mr. Bush?  Could it be OIL?  Could it be
GREED?  Of course not.  Shame on me for thinking our leaders in this great
corporate country would have such motivations.  That's just plain
"unpatriotic" and "anti-american."  Keep buying it America.  Keep letting
these people who could care less about the average person what is and what
is not patriotic and American.  Because Bush and his administration love
each and every one of us. Excuse me, I think I need to vomit now. I'm sure we can find a whole bunch of maniacal leaders throughout the world
who hate the United States.  There aren't a whole hell of a lot of countries
in the world that like us because of our wonderful leaders' magnificent
foreign policies and dealings.  Some of them say they do, because they are
afraid that we will massacre them if they don't, and others just enjoy the
revenue they receive from business dealings with us.  So, here we are,
murdering thousands of Iraqis and sacrificing the lives of our own troops
for the sake of what?  We were told that a big part of this was to give Iraq
a democracy.  Gee, I thought that people vote in a democracy.  I would think
that appointing a leader without an election would be the opposite, but what
do I know.  Then again, we live in a democracy, and our presidential
election is somewhat fictional at times.  We were also supposed to be there
to uncover these WMD's that Bush spoke so confidently about having knowledge
of.  Well, Georgie boy, WHERE ARE THEY?  Then again, if they had them, it
would probably be because we funded Mr. Hussein in the first place.  Oh
yeah, didn't our CIA train Bin Laden and the Taliban and provide him with a
windfall of money as well?  
Of course, I will be called anti-American for saying the things I say, but
nothing could be further from the truth.  Being against a greedy Corporate
run Government that stops at nothing to build profits is not the same thing
as being anti-American.  Not in my America.  I care about my fellow citizens
who share this land with me.  I care about our rights and freedom.  I also
care that we are being pumped with fear in order to allow the government to
take away the rights that we have.  I care that imaginary terrorist threats
are being fabricated and "taken care of" in order to keep us afraid and
believe that our leaders are keeping us safe.  I care that our government
developed something they call the USA "Patriot" Act to combat "Terrorism"
that gives the government the right to keep track of your every move with no
reason or valid suspicion of wrong doing.  Unless everyone is suspected of
being a terrorist, that doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense now does
it?  Remember those privacy forms you filled out at the doctor's office? 
Well, that was a crock.  The "Patriot" Act allows them to go through your
medical records along with anything else at their leisure.  Sounds real
patriotic, doesn't it.  About as patriotic as wiping your backside with a
copy of the US Constitution.  Damn them for using the word Patriot in this
Unconstitutional nonsense.  If being patriotic means supporting a War that
has no merit than I want no part of it.  If it means upholding the
constitution than I am all for it.  I am patriotic towards my fellow human
being, not towards a bunch of greedy warmongers hellbent on power! I am not against the troops that are so valiantly putting their lives on the
line because they believe that they are really fighting for our "freedom." 
I salute them for their bravery and feel horrible that the establishment was
able to convince them of that lie.  It's a shame that they send our soldiers
out risking their lives, with false intentions.  
The Corporate government and media have certainly done a wonderful job of
turning lies into truth.  A lot of people will not go see the revealing, and
powerful, Fahrenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore (because they were told by the
New York Post, Newsday, etc. that he is lying) without even bothering to
look into it for themselves.  People trust these wonderful corporate news
sources.  They trust them way too much.  There were actually things that I
read in a Post review of Fahrenheit 9/11 that were blatant lies claiming
that Moore said things in the film that he did not even say.  Other things
were disputed in that and other news sources, that Moore obtained from
government documents.  "Oh say can you see..." that the media is not
entirely honest with us.  Could it be that the same corporations that are
running the media are running our country?    
I have always been one to question authority, but I have never in my life
felt more justified in that distrust than I do right now.  I feel like I
should have been paying more attention to what was going on a long time ago
but regret is an ugly word that I choose not to define.  With the whirlwind
of lies that we have all been pasted with and all of the confusion that has
come with it, none of us can be blamed for being complacent.  We're
misinformed and misled.  I think we should shock the system and show them
that we know how to fight (without violence and bloodshed) and turn out in
record numbers this year to the voting booth to begin to take our country
back.  I admit with shame that I have not voted in a long time myself (I had
given up on all of these dishonest politicians and it was much more relaxing
not to fight it), but that is all going to change from now on.  All keeping
it in does is force your frustrations out on others as you misdirect your
emotions.  If we all can convince others to do so as well, we may not be
able to change things in a day, but a little at a time is all we can hope
for.  Send letters to our Congressmen when we have something to say or a
question to be answered and let our voices be heard whenever possible.  We
need to let the establishment know that we are not just going to sit in
silence as our rights are being incinerated.  What we can do for now is
vote, encourage others to vote, and otherwise just be heard.  We have to
stop grabbing our ankles and taking one for the team.  Vote for whoever you
want (just not GW ... ah hem ... just an opinion).  Seriously, just vote and
speak your mind ... I think there's a little bit of the first amendment
there ... somewhere ... I think.

... Suddenly takes a backseat to a larger, questionable agenda to the
powers-that-be in Washington, D.C. I don't know about the rest of
Americans, but I enjoy the rights granted to me by the Constitution,
and I'm not giving them up for any reason, even if it is to capture
terrorists, which our government obviously cannot do. Jolly populist
filmmaker Michael Moore pulls no punches with his latest documentary,
the wickedly titled "Fahrenheit 9/11," an obvious play on Ray
Bradbury's classic novel "Fahrenheit 451."I don't think that Moore has the slightest clue what really happened on
Sept. 11, 2001 when four planes were hijacked by terrorists and two
crashed into the World Trade Center, one at the Pentagon, and the last
in Pennsylvania. In the troubling times since that fateful day, I've
not heard a single convincing defense of the Bush Administration's
claims that the 9/11 attacks were in any way, not preventable, and that
the reasons for going to war in the Middle East are highly suspect as
well.Moore seems to believe that there was a lot more to the official story
that Osama Bin Laden and his terrorist camp al-Qaeda are always
plotting against us, that they may be the least of our worries, and
that our own President George W. Bush stole the 2000 election and is
using our fear of terrorism to help carry out sinister business
transactions in the Middle East. The film goes to great lengths to
condemn our president, to make him look like a fool (and in many ways
succeeds), to prove Bush family links to Saudi Arabia, and that he
deliberately misled the country into the Iraq conflict.I had never heard of Michael Moore before his Oscar-Winning documentary
"Bowling For Columbine" but after seeing that riveting masterpiece, I
now see a lot of his work as required viewing by the American public.
Whether this film will succeed in its intended goal of ousting Bush
from the White House come this November, remains to be seen. I am now
of legal voting age and I aim to take full advantage of this
opportunity to exercise this God-given right.Moore briefly explored Bush's reign of terror as the U.S. president to
some degree in his winning account of gun violence in our country. But
he did not go real deep into that subject matter and here, he takes
every chance to bash the hell out of him whenever he is on screen."Fahrenheit 9/11" is the most emotional and powerful documentary I've
ever seen; it is also downright hilarious in some spots, and brutally
graphic in others. Gathering up footage from the Senate and actual war
footage of the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, it makes for a funny
and disturbing experience. Beware though, this film's "R" rating is
there for a reason, and the realistic war footage is what earns it; if
there's one thing that the nay-sayers got right, it was the
"Restricted" warning.If you haven't guessed it, I'm obviously on the side that everyone
hates, which is Moore's side. I don't like Bush, and I feel that our
country could not survive another four years under his reckless and
dangerous leadership. Moore goes to the extreme sometimes with
"Fahrenheit 9/11" in painting a portrait of Bush as not far from the
people he is so eagerly pursuing with our military. In the film, Bush
is seen as being quite incompetent - totally unprepared to run our
country.I hope that Michael Moore continues doing what he is doing, being that
he may be one of the few, brave American filmmakers left in this
country that is willing to fight for what he thinks matters most  our
freedom; for some reason, this very right is being challenged by a
great many people in the George Bush America of current times.10/10

**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**The approach I always have about movies like this is, if 1/4 of the stuff in
it is true, it did it's job.  Of what's presented in Fahrenheit 9/11, I've
read about most of it in other books and such.  It's nice to see someone put
it altogether visually in such an engaging way.  Bowling for Columbine was
an EXCELLENT documentary, and Moore's Fahrenheit is right up there.  A LOT
of questions are raised, and a lot is exposed of Bush's devilish campaign as
US President.  It's kind of hard to dispute what's presented here, because
what Moore showed really happened; real news bites, real people; everything
is there in writing somewhere and has been proven....from the rigged
election to the current ill-advised 'war on terror'.  The news piece he
showed with the guy advertising his 'invention' of a portable parachute was
brilliant, because it showed just how LUDICROUS everything that's going on
really is.  The piece on Lydia, the super-patriotic woman bragging about
having a military family--turned anti-patriot mom who loses a son in the
war, was CLASSIC.  That whole segment could've stood alone and the point
would've been taken and understood perfectly.  I think that's when all of
what Moore shows & talks about in Fahrenheit 9/11 REALLY hits home....and
it's all presented and executed flawlessly.  Michael Moore has done it
again...this is a very important film you would NOT want to miss. 
Wonderful.**** out of **** stars.

Unfortunately we now live in a world where the right wing of the GOP
owns Fox News and CNN outright and ABC, CBS, and NBC follow their false
reporting like spineless sheep. Moore asks the questions millions of
Americans have been wanting answers to for three years. He shows us
things the White House doesn't want us to see: dead Iraqi civilians,
maimed US soldiers, and an unelected president who sat on his ass for
half an hour while the country was under attack. Unlike Fox and CNN,
Moore does not pretend to be balanced or objective. He is presenting
his point of view, and giving us the reasons he holds it. See this
movie, but be ready for tears of grief and rage.

This will be the most powerful move for years to come. It will show how
humans have become vulnerable to the power of the media and money. This
movie will make historic changes in elections. The movie was definitely
worth every dollar that I spent on it.Michael did a good job by including humor in an otherwise serious
subject. I really liked the story-line of the lady who lost her son. NO
ONE EVER THINKS THAT BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. I liked the way
Michael showed that Senators do not want their children in the army.
Michael did a "Tasteful" job of not showing the 9/11 pictures but
leaving us with the sounds of the day. Those sounds were so similar to
the sounds of Bagdad. The movie is definitely a shocker. Every one old
enough to vote should watch this movie.Not watching the movie is tantamount to ignorance.

The reason Michael Moores movies make such an impact on people is the
light hearted method in which he presents incredibly serious
information. Fahrenheit 9/11 is no different, it is hilarious,
disconcerting, gruesome, heartwarming, frustrating and shocking. Not everyone will agree with its content, but it is hard to imagine
that anyone can sit through it and not receive some kind of enjoyment.
Several of my hard core republican bush supporting friends have seen it
and while they think its all propaganda (thats another dispute
entirely) each of them agrees that the movie was done very very well.
How many documentaries can you say that about?Go see it and judge for yourself.

When a person commenting on the merits of this film's politics can't
even spell the name Kerry properly ... one really has to question the
validity of the persons views as being that of an informed, intelligent
person. The lies, misdirections and smearing of this movie by those who
don't agree with liberalism, and are knee-jerk (emphasis on the later
portion of that term) Bush apologists are so transparent when they pull
out wholly irrelevant non-sequiturs like blowj*bs in the Oval Office to
distract from the reality and facts this film lays out for the viewer.Iraq is Vietnam redux writ large.Anyone who has delved into the financial interests that led us into
that war need to take a close look at the players in this debacle.Anyone willing to read about just this aspect alone, all they need to
do is google "RMK-BRJ" and "Vietnam" in the same search and read about
who made BILLIONS off of building the bases and support infrastructure
in that war and this one. (hint, the BR stands for Brown & Root).Our bankrupt policies in the middle east, and as they pertain to Iraq,
Iran and Saudi Arabia is the most sorry sell-out of our moral
high-ground as it pertains to foreign policy.. which date back to the
after-shocks of WWI and specifically in the post WWII era. Overthrowing
the democratically elected governments of both countries, and
installing CIA backed puppets. To propping up the despotic regime in
Saudi Arabia. One need only look at who funds, arms, trains, equipped
and fills the roles of the internal Saudi security forces in that
country. Carlyle Group subsidiary 100%.Iran became the enemy in the late 70s as the despotic Shah we (via the
CIA) installed in 1953 and who made Saddam look like a rank amateur was
overthrown, then then we backed Iraq in the war against Iran, selling
them intel and the chemical weapons to fill those mass graves that the
GOP apologists use as their last desperate thread to justify the Iraq
invasion (after WMD and al-Qaeda links went out the window). Then Iraq
became the enemy when Saddam (also CIA backed and installed) went off
the reservation and invaded Kuwait when we said we had no position in
intra-arab conflicts.Iraq had to be invaded lest it finally have sanctions dropped because
it would then flood the market with oil, but selling it to the EU and
trading in Euros not dollars.Anyone who thinks that Iraq had anything to do with "security" or WMDs
or "terrorism" is a fool.Only the idiotic uninformed GOP ideologues or their duped enablers can
watch this movie (which has its facts vetted and bulletproof.. pun
noted) and still rail against the truths presented therein.Finally the medium of film, which can simply present these truths in an
easy to access form, is waking up the apathetic, the misinformed and
the fearful to the alarming truth. The cancer eating at the heart of
our nation in the form of self-absorbed, greedy faux moralizing
criminals looking to line their pockets.Most Americans have been to disengaged to the politics of our nation,
and the things done in our names. But we are a good people at heart,
and when presented with the truth, we want to do the right thing. This
is why this administration and its sycophant apologists and mouth-
breathing defenders are in a panic and apoplectic over this film...
because it exposes a bright ray of sunshine on the cesspool of this
administration.Michael Moore is a true patriot, who loves his country, loves our
troops and loves the ideals we hold sacred in our nation. Thos who seek
to rail against Moore and those who speak out, and speak truth to power
should heed the words of the great GOP (when they stood for American
ideals before their co-option by the witch's brew of corporate greed
and religious fanaticism) Teddy Roosevelt who wisely intoned..."To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that
we are to stand by the President right or wrong, is not only
unpatriotic and servile, but it is morally treasonable to the American
public."

Some are missing the point- what I think makes Fahrenheit 9/11 a very
good documentary: its not a matter of whether you agree or disagree
with its views, what is important is that its bringing up important
questions to the table; that it promotes discussions; that its making
people (especially in the US) think and question what has happened
since (and before) 9/11. Many accuse Moore of being biased, but
considering how biased the media has been in the US (a form of
misguided patriotism?), this is a breath of fresh air... a breath of
healthy air. Air of dissent. Isn't that what freedom of speech is all
about?

Some of the comments I've seen here seem to have been composed by
people who have "heard" about the movie (and its "lies") but who have
not been to see the movie. To those folks especially, I hope you do not
make a habit of posting criticisms of movies you haven't been to see.
Whether you agree with Michael Moore's tactics or appreciate his
film-making techniques, anyone who has followed the news will
appreciate that Moore has done his research. The most powerful message
of the film is that the USA cannot function without freedom of the
press. This country is lost if we do not demand responsible, tenacious,
thorough reporting of possible conflicts of interest in high places.
This movie started out light and then broke my heart. It is a plea for
pulling America from ignorance; it argues against squandering the lives
of our fighting men and women.Michael Moore may be heavy-handed and sophomoric at times, but his
message is critical to the survival of our nation.Consider yourself a patriot? Pull your head out of the sand, turn off
your FOX news, and go see the film.

Michael Moore made the film a reality check for all American people ,
especially the poor. Where was Bush when 9-11 happened? Vacationing in
Florida with his brother.Huh? 3000 people died on 9-11. could Mickey
mouse take the place of those 3000 people? ask any mother who lost a
child! My tax dollars are going to the goofiest Presidential terrorist
group I had ever imagined. The Bush administration. Only one person had
a son or daughter from a member of congress that was actually in Iraq.
Where's Georgie boy? hunting big game or playing golf on my tax
dollars. Are any of George's relatives in Iraq? No! Ask any poor mother
who sends her son or daughter to the military if they could have afford
a college education instead of sending their loved one to war to watch
Bush play golf? I would choose to work my ass off to know that I would
see my child the next day. If you are a Bush puppet keep believing him
or do a little research on your own. I could count the lies and I
certainly won't be fooled again.

Michael Moore's documentary compels one's attention. My family was
riveted and I learned a few things I did not know before. His
detractors seem to be fools who voted for Bush, without researching his
past, because he appeared to be a 'good Christian'. These ridiculous
idiots could not be expected to take advantage of information
technology because; gaining knowledge requires effort and discipline.
Michael didn't distort information, he exposed dirty facts and, he left
enough out to make another movie. The Bush family hasn't felt bound by
anything as pathetic as legality, morality or humanity since before
grandpappy Prescott. Bush is not an intelligent man, but he believes in
his divinity and would not lose sleep over the deaths of a few thousand
Americans. Don't be angry with Michael's methods. He's just trying to
pull your head out of the sand long enough to glimpse the world.Michael, you're a brilliant and witty educator. I have some projects
for you, how about researching Leonard Peltier's case? Why not run for
president? You'll get my vote.

Given that we know Michael Moore has a certain point of view, I went to
see the film with an open mind, to see what I could verify as "fact"
apart from his agenda.Even given cutting, editing, positioning, juxtaposition, etc. there are
some very damning words right out of Bush's own mouth, which are
clearly revealing of his character (or rather lack of it) his
ineptitude, his greed and his tragic lack of leadership. There is no
doubt that he exposes himself as a very weak and tragically inept
president. "It's nice to see all of you here tonight, the haves and the
have-mores. I just call you my base."But there is far more to this film than mere Bush-bashing. Moore
explores the plight of the young soldiers sent to Iraq, the pain of
their parents and the miserable dilemma of both those sent to fight a
senseless war and the civilians killed and maimed for no reason at all.
Moore introduces a theme that is completely absent in the works of
Rumsfield, Cheney, etc, - human compassion.I went to see this movie on a weekday afternoon and the theater was
completely packed- I just hope it's not preaching to the choir and that
those who are undecided, uninvolved or not registered to vote will get
off the dime and take America back while there is still time. Michael
Moore may have his agenda, but I think he has spoken at last what we
need to realize and Fahrenheit 911 is a great act of patriotism.

This work of art, compiled masterfully by Michael Moore, should be seen
by all in the U.S.. Whether or not they have interest in politics, a
movie like this opens the eyes of America. Someone who has always
blindly voted for their leader should see this movie and see just how
much they have not been seeing. There is a method to madness, which is
why the government is run just like a corporation, to make profits for
the upper members. There are some graphic images in this movie, but
they are for the better. I do not like how the media is so censored and
biased. Not to say that this movie is not biased against our president,
the sheer volume of facts that Moore has makes it worth the while to
watch. This isn't the kind of movie that one will go see, laugh at, and
forget it the next day. This movie will affect the way you think for
the rest of your life for the better, opening your eyes to a whole new
line of thinking.

I can see how the opposition could attack some of his weaker points,
and say that there is creative editing. However, I think the basis of
the film is strong, there are obvious contradictions and ignorance in
the Bush administration. For example, they gave a location as to where
the "weapons of mass destruction" were in Iraq. Um, yeah, never there.
Also very compelling was the letter of the deceased son of the woman in
Flint, Michigan. It was heartwrenching, but also informative. He did
not believe that we should have ever gone to Iraq and was set against
Bush after that. Also, the Colonel that said he'd rather go to jail
than back to Iraq. Some of it is difficult to watch, but I would
recommend that everyone with a mind see this, for this upcoming
election will determine our country's fate.

See Fahrenheit 9/11. Whether you're a peacenik or a hawk, it answers
those haunting questions we've all had since 9/11. Why were FBI
warnings ignored, why were the planes not stopped, why was the Bin
Laden family secreted out of the country immediately by the White
House. But the most powerful part of the film is the personal story of
a woman who lost her son in Iraq and a look at what's actually
happening to all the kids we've sent to that hell hole. War doesn't
look like such a viable option when it hits so close to home.
Especially a war waged for money and greed.

Whilst this movie taught me nothing new (people outside the US actually read
reliable non-partisan news sources) I think it has the potential to bring
the message, the real truth about 9/11, about Bush, about Bin Laden etc...
to the vast sitting down, hamburger & popcorn eating American
audiences.Exactly what the hamburger-maestro-documentro-extrodianaire Michael Moore
wanted.Purely for this fact this movie deserves a 10 in my book.But I worry that more terrorism will "happen" to arrive in the US
pre-election, and thus disrupting the election or even possibly posponing
it.  Then the world will see "Great Leader" Bush again and he will get the
sympathy vote or get a chance to steal more votes this year in the
predictable confusion.  Still, at least it gives Michael Moore a
sequel.

I have been hearing nasty relationship between Mr.Bush and oil industry. 
Before watching this film I thought it was just another gossip.  After
watching this, I cried hard because billions of people are suffering by the
actions of, just for his family/gang's interest, Mr.Bush.  This has to
change.  I would like to vote for 2004 presidential campaign, but i have
foreign nationality all I can do is to pray.One comment made by my American friend (we watched this movie in Canada
together) was that, "this is my first time to see dead US military people". 
Mr.Bush is controlling news media very well, it seems.  I would like to have
a satellite dish which can receive Alja-jira (sp?), so that I can watch news
from US point-of-view as well as the other side.

Michael Moore is fantastic! I didn't care that it was biased at
all...every American should see this fascinating movie that reveals
truly what a deer-in-the-headlights president we have. He questions his
integrity, how much he himself is actually doing (the beginning shows
him on vacation for much of his first year in office) and what exactly
his plan was/is for Iraq and Afghanistan. Michael Moore is rough around
the edges and known for making trouble, and in fact many people he
approaches in the film hear his name and take off without another word,
but he is ultimately very effective. Disturbing and moving, every voter
should see this before November...do you really want this guy around
for another 4 years??

I believe that most people do want to know the truth. And so many of us
were not aware of the truth, because it was not made readily available
to us via most of our media. American Idol was pushed into our homes,
and realities that we needed to be aware of were left out. Finally,
thanks to this film, we all have the chance to understand what has
happened to our world in the last few years, and why. Some people may
not want to see this movie because of the violence of war that is
depicted in it. And some people really cannot tolerate viewing
violence. Those who can, should watch it. After all, the victims of war
hardly have the choice whether to participate or not. And it does drive
home the reality of what has happened in the few last years. Those who
choose not to view it and those who feel that some of the facts may be
incorrect, should consider reading "House of Bush / House of Saud" by
Craig Unger, which has much of the same information and is very well
footnoted. It is most important for us to educate ourselves. History
books will not forgive us for following blindly.

Freepers are complaining that Michael Moore plays fast and loose with

Administration is that it plays fast and loose with the facts. I wonder
if the freepers are capable of analyzing the BS put out by the Bush
Administration with the same critical eye that they're analyzing
Michael Moore's polemic.By the way, "Fahrenheit 9/11" isn't the first time that Dubya appeared
in a feature film. In fact, he once worked with the late President
Reagan. Remember "Bedtime for Bonzo?" The Freepers Creed: "How dare you

This film presents a look into the behind-the-scenes, manipulative
activities of the powerful corporate elite and their U.S. government
allies in their efforts to transform the world into their own image for
their own self interests. Michael Moore elicits the secretive,
closed-door deals of George W. Bush and his powerful friends.This is a sad movie because it accurately depicts the continuing shift
of power from the average U.S. citizen to the powerful corporate elite
and how that transformation has overburdened average, middle- and
lower-class Americans with the war on terrorism, while giving the
powerful corporate elites comfortable, risk-free, economic profits and
power. I am a politically independent person, not a liberal or a

Wow. I thought I couldn't dislike George W. anymore than I did, but I
was mistaken. Any trust I had in him whatsoever is completely gone
after seeing this eye-opening expose on the business relationship
between the Bush family and the Bin Ladins of Saudi Arabia, I have very
credible reasons to hold Bush uncredible. The chain of events are so
fluent, that they cannot be coincidental. Osama created an attack that
diverted the attention and feelings of the world away from what Bush
really wanted to do (invade Iraq, because no president involved in a
war has ever lost reelection), and Bush covered Osama's ass because of
his ties to the Bin Ladin family from whom he received much capitol in
his previous business "adventures". The facts are there and for anyone
to contest them, they would be impossible to misprove. Great movie,
want to see it again.

It seems like Moore let blind hatred for Bush and his cabal get in the way
of clear thinking. Was this a film about a stolen election? Racism in
Congress? Ineffectual federal bureaucracy? Simple ineptitude on the part of
George W. Bush? Collusion between the Bush and bin Laden families? Moore
breezes through all of these, but doesn't concentrate on any of them long
enough to make it stick. The only theme seems to be that Bush sucks and
needs to get booted from office. Moore is hardly the only person making that
argument these days, and he doesn't do it any more convincingly than anyone
else. It seems like IMDb voters here aren't rating the movie, but rather John
Kerry. I guess it's no surprise that 63 percent of the people who saw this
movie gave it a "10." The likelihood that they appreciate the structure of
Moore's arguments is less than the likelihood that they just hate Bush and
will cheer for anyone who feels the same. Watching the crowd during a
showing at Berkeley's packed California Theater was itself quite a
spectacle. And I doubt that many among the 22% who gave the movie a "1" even
saw it. Surely one can at least give Moore credit for delving a little
deeper into Bush's National Guard files or questioning the decision of James
Baker's law firm to represent the Saudi government against families of 9/11
victims. Apparently the cousins of die-hard Bushies have clued them into the
existance of IMDb. Kudos to Moore for finding the intrepid minority of soldiers and their
families willing to speak out against the Iraq invasion.Though his arguments are pretty thin, Moore raises enough questions to give
pause to America's shrinking political middle: Why exactly did Bush sit
around looking confused after an aide whispered that a second plane hit the
World Trade Center? Why exactly were the bin Ladens whisked out of the
country? Did the family's presence at Osama's son's wedding constitute
support for the terrorist leader? How did Bush's cousin at Fox News
influence the outcome of the 2000 election? Did five (or seven) Supreme
Court justices really ignore questions of law in stopping the Florida
recount? Why didn't even one Democratic senator support African-American
House members in their protests of the election results? Was the USA Patriot
Act really pushed through in 24 hours, as Moore implies? What exactly was
the connection between the delay in air raids on Taliban and al-Qaeda bases
with the oil line that Halliburton through Afghanistan?If Moore was trying to prove anything, he failed. But if even a thousand
moviegoers felt jolted from their Fox News-flag-waving world long enough to
take a critical look at what's been happening, the country will be better
off for it.

If you are looking for a fair and measured evaluation of all of the facts
you can skip this movie. This movie is an opinion piece and thus one sided.
Criticizing it for being one-sided only proves that you miss the point.This movie represents how many of us see the Bush administration. Little
Dubya was a lousy student, a lousy national guardsman (drugs), a terrible
business man, and now he is a lousy president with lousy taste in advisors.The movie uses actual footage to illustrate many of its main points. Thanks
to clever editing these bits of footage are often very funny. The packed
theatre I saw this movie in laughed often and laughed loud.Hard core Bush fans will dismiss this film outright (probably before even
seeing it) Bush hater will find the movie very amusing as Moore pokes fun at
the Village Idiot in Chief. However, if you are on the fence you might want to see this movie for
yourself. Many of the facts presented are a matter of public record. When
you see them all pieced together to paint a larger picture you might be
suprised what you see. Read the reviews that bash this movie carefully. Most of them seem to be
more anti-Michael Moore or Pro Bush than actually about the movie.The movie itself is entertaining, interesting, and scary whether or not you
plan on voting republican in November.(And to everyone outside of the USA:  We're sorry. We will try to do better
in November. Give us some time.)

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a rather biased documentary of the Bush Administration's
actions relevant to the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001. It covers elements
such as the disputed 2000 Presidential Election; Bush's business background;
the Bush family ties to Saudi Arabia; the Department of Homeland Security;
John Ashcroft; Afghanistan; and, of course, Iraq.It's hard to review a heavily polarizing film such as this without
commenting on the politics, but I will endeavor to do so. As a film,
Fahrenheit 9/11 is actually a very good documentary.First, it has very interesting segments. Moore has a clever talent for
splicing various footages and soundtracks together to various effects:
sometimes humorous, sometimes horrible, all interesting. An example (one
widely publicized in the media), shows President Bush happily golfing and
cutting brush at his Texas ranch in August of 2001, all played to the Go-Gos
"Vacation". Very funny stuff. Some of the later segments are sad, or
violent, or disturbing. All of them are very well done.Next, this film has a better flow than "Bowling for Columbine". The film
easily transitions from one segment to the next, the viewer is never lost.
The best example of this is in the first half-hour, when he transitions from
that funny footage of the President into the terror of 9/11 with one of the
best black-screen moments in cinematic history.Moore is actually able to make his point in "Fahrenheit". His thought
process in "Columbine" was so scattered it was hard to see what his points
actually where. He does not have that problem here. And Michael Moore wisely
decides to stay off-screen, making an excellent narration, instead of trying
to be the star of the piece (another criticism I gave to "B4C"). He needs to
keep his own persona out of his films. Use it for media coverage, Jay Leno
interviews, etc. But keep it off the screen.On the negative side, and to Moore's great discredit, he still likes the
surprise attack, this time harping on Congressmen who don't send their
children to Iraq. I always find this tactic distasteful. Whether on an MTV
"Punk'd" episode or a high-minded activist documentary, it's still abhorrent
to me. Cheap shots are not entertainment.9 out of 10. I took one point away because of the Congressional ambush
stunt. Moore needs to take that trick out of his playbook ...
forever.I do have to give a disclaimer that I am opposed to our President Bush. But
I didn't need Moore's film to tell me why.

In my precedent post I have been talking about the honesty of this movie
which shows real facts and doesn't push so much the audience suggesting
conclusions. Now I want to emphasize the reaction of the public. What
surprised me is that I saw this movie at the Miami Beach theater, where
people are not so intellectual and politicized and even in this theater
every time the face of Mr. Bush appears on the screen people start to laugh
out of loud. At the end of the movie people stand up and applaud. As we are
just few month far from the president
election I guess that all that is a really bad sign for the next
ex-president. By the way, I'm Italian and from my point of sight this is a
very well done documentary about this controversial presidency and it helps
a lot the audience to understand how big economical interests can push to
wrong decisions just to help big economical trust even taking disastrous
results. A really must to see.

This was my first Moore film. Even though I have heard many positives of his
works, I was never motivated to see one. An avid watcher of The Today Show,
I was impressed with the speed, clarity, depth and compassion that Moore
used in responding to questions that were meant to derail the legitimacy of
his answers. This is the single most important film for the black man in at least a
decade. Moore exposes, discusses, and for the most part plots a destructive
path that started 30 years ago, and ends at the top level of government.As many rumors abound, and stories you may have added your two cents too, be
sure to see this eye opening examination of the country's first family.Not since Oliver Stone examined JFK has a political campaign been so
exposed

This movie is going to spark heated debate for a long time, and it's
going to be at least a marginal reference point in political history,
so you should see it. It's not an Oliver Stone conspiracy theory - it
just clearly depicts the powers and motivations that actually control
this country, and it's an important film to see for education's sake.
Regardless of your party affiliation, after this movie you won't see
the government the same way. I personally found it emotionally powerful - no one in the theater
could resist tears at Lila's grief - and though I was strongly opposed
to the war in Iraq and to Bush before seeing the movie, the raw and
brutal footage of the carnage was an awakening. My complaint with the film is Moore's smug voice-over. Had his tone not
been so wry and smug, and potentially off-putting to undecided voters,
I'd be more confident in the movie's potential to affect the vote in
November. The Republican party also seems to be trying to suppress it -
you should go see it before they make it illegal.

Let the critics (most of whom haven't seen it) rant. Moore lays it out,
letting the Bush administration speak for itself visually and verbally.
The movie makes its point with humor but never fails to drive its
points home. If the news media did its job, we wouldn't need Michael
Moore. As it doesn't, we most definitely do.It's hard to imagine how Moore got hold of some of the more damaging
footage. The post-election scene in Congress is hard to believe. The
footage of Iraqi civilian and US military casualties is graphic. I
found myself asking again and again - "Why do I have to go to the
movies to see all this - why is it not on the nightly news?"No matter how much you think you know about the last four years, I
guarantee there will be surprises here.

killed and our own troops put in unnecessary risks. If you don't like
hearing that our own pseudo-president has lied right from the
beginning... this movie isn't for you. Just keep living in your dream
world... or wake up and smell the coffee... we have been duped. I know
that it is a hard pill to swallow...but we were wrong to do what we
did....and if you feel that Micheal Moore has skewed the truth....I
think you should consider the way bush skewed the truth first.

I hadn't voted. Simply because I've always felt choosing candidates was
a tweedle-dee versus tweedle-dum choice. No matter how I voted I would
be marginalized. Money and corruption would make the decisions in
Washington; not the people.While I still believe many in all parties in Washington are corrupt
Michael Moore's film has gotten me to believe I am partly responsible
for this situation as I am doing nothing to help correct it.'Fahrenheit 9/11' is unquestionably a blatant attack on President
George W Bush. Whether it is a documentary or not depends on how one
defines 'documentary.' This film is scarier than the Exorcist at times
... and funnier than dumb and dumber at times ... so it could be called
a horror film or comedy as well.'Fahrenheit 9/11' does make George W Bush look like an incompetent,
50-something, amoral, frat-boy of very limited intelligence.If there is even some partial truth that the George W Bush of
'Fahrenheit 9/11' is the "leader of the free world" then it's a very
scary, eye opening movie.So what this movie has done for me - and why I believe it's a great
movie - is to get me to acknowledge that it may matter who is running
our country. It may matter who I vote for.

i am deeply saddened. the media have partaken in gross mishandling of
this information. they just are not doing their jobs. this movie is
completely shocking and i find myself in a surreal state after watching
it. how could this all happen without a peep from the media? this is
number one proof that our media are bought and sold and complicit.
please tell 10 of your friends (whatever their political stance) to see
this film. i wish i could tell you more, but you just must see it, you
won't believe it. you really won't believe it. one thing that made me
crazy in disbelief was george bush laughing when getting ready to
announce that we were going to war on iraq who had NOTHING to do with
911. he was laughing. sick.

Well, perhaps unavoidably the IMDB comments for the film have become a forum
for political flag-waving.  It seems that it's virtually impossible for
anybody to consider political issues with any degree of objectivity, since
the 2-party political system instills party loyalty greater than an y
football team.  Those that class themselves as "Republican" will vote 1 and
declare the film to be all lies (probably without seeing it in many cases),
those that declare themselves "Democrat" will vote 10 and say it proves that
the Democrats were right all along (about what?).   Politics shouldn't be
about parties, it shouldn't be about loyalty to anyone or anything - it
should be about making decisions that are right for the country and for the
world, and each issue needs to be considered in its own right, regardless of
where any particular party stands on it.So, anyway, back to the film :p  I keep reading comments that the "real
hero" of the film was Lila from Flint, and that her scenes were the ones
that really made an impression on people.  Whilst watching the film I
wondered if that was what Moore was trying to achieve (by giving her more
screen time than her story seemed to deserve), but it seemed to me that she
came off almost as badly as Bush.  Now, call me heartless, but here is a
woman that was totally pro-Bush, pro-Iraq invasion until her son got killed.
 As a soldier.  In Iraq.  At no point did she seem to have the slightest
concern about the THOUSANDS of Iraqis that have been killed, including many
who were in no way combatants.  She didn't seem to care about the hundreds
of other American mothers that lost sons either ("Why did it have to be MY
son?"), just the fact that HER son died.  In a war, as a soldier.  It's
exactly this kind of self-centred (apologies in advance) idiocy that got the
country into the war in Iraq, that gives a president like Bush enough
popular support to get into office and launch an invasion against a country
that has presented no specific threat, based on no particular evidence that
it might do in the future.  "Hey, if it takes a few Iraqi deaths to
safeguard our homeland security that seems fair enough" (no, she didn't say
that, I'm trying to imagine the mind set).To me this is where Moore's energies would have been better directed - not
at the fact that Bush is a terrible president (well documented), but at what
it is about the American people that lets a man like Bush become president. 
Why it is that the US became a target for terrorist attacks (hint, it's not
because anybody "hates freedom" - try looking into the history of the many
coups and rebellions the us has sponsored in the past 40 years, including
one led by a certain Osama Bin Laden).  It's happened time and again, under
Democrats AND Republicans, and now its backfired.  Have we learnt our
lesson?Bush is out of the office this coming election, no question about that, but
who's going to be in his place?  Kerry this time, who next?  How much do we
know about Kerry?  How did *he* get to the position where he's a candidate
for the US presidency?  The fact is that that we don't care *who* is
president, or what they do on foreign soil as long as it allows us to live
our comfortable lives with cheap gas and a flag to wave that makes us feel
special.  The 2 party system is not a democracy, it's just a show to focus
our attentions on and let us pretend we're in control of something that
we're not.  Bush's failure as a president ought to finally open our eyes to
this fact - he's as much a failure for the super-wealthy that put him in
power expecting a brainless puppet they can manipulate for their own
"special interests", who probably never expected him to be so self-righteous
and arrogant he'd draw all this attention to himself.  But Bush is not the
problem, he's just the warning sign.  The problems run much deeper than
that, to the whole system of government that is practised in the USA today. 
The principles of "Truth, Liberty and Justice For All" have long been
subverted to "More Profit for the Rich" (incidentally, how is it that
"Liberals" are called "Unamerican" when "Liberty" is one of 3 things that's
meant to define America?  How long before Truth and Justice are declared
unpatriotic as well?).  Voting for Bush or for Kerry isn't going to change
that...  America needs to take a much deeper look at how the country is run,
who wins and who loses.  Unfortunately, as long as we're driving our
gas-guzzling SUVs and sports cars, there doesn't seem to be much urgency. 
It's not until it affects us in a more direct way, like Lila, that we start
to ask whether the price of our comfort is really worth
paying.Whoops, I guess it's hard to write about this film without getting political
after all :p

A very powerful movie.If you walk out of the theater unaffected then you have a heart of
stone.I wish this movie was already available on DVD so that I could buy
copies and send them to all my relatives. Instead I'll be mailing them
$20 bills and imploring them to go see this movie.This movie impressed me. I heard all about the slant and how Moore has
been accused of doctoring interviews to get his point of view across.I didn't see any of that. I see footage from CNN and White House press
conferences and legal documents released from the White House.Every American needs to see this movie.

Fahrenheit 911 was exactly what this country needed. In a nation where
the "Patriot" Act scares people into keeping their mouths shut, we
needed a man as brave and talented as Michael Moore to release a film
of this nature. It brilliantly portrays the darker side of the Bush
administration, which is the side that other parts of the media are
afraid to mention. It masterfully shows the atrocities committed by the
current government, starting with the sneaking and lying used to obtain
their power right down to the dishonesty used to get blind support of
an unjustified war. This movie was heart-wrenching, thought-provoking,
and wonderfully informative. Moore gets a 10/10 for this gem. Thank
you, Mike.

The movie has been sold out all over Dallas all weekend. Finally saw it
this afternoon. Before the movie began a guy was screaming that you
can't vote out a president when you are in the middle of the war.This man didn't have anything to say at the end of the movie. I never cry in movies yet I cried in this one. My husband never cries
yet this movie made him cry. The man on the other side of me, a
complete stranger, cried.This is not a movie to see only once. You must see it more than once to
take it all in. I can't wait to see it again and take friends so we can
discuss it.People stood and cheered at the end. Yes, in Dallas, TX.

Michael Moore is a genius. The construction of the movie is tight and
to the point. From Bush's selection by his Daddy's friends on the
Supreme Court, through his connections to Carlyle and the Bin Ladens,
and finally, to his stunted state of development, as evidenced by his
inane facial expressions, both just after the attacks of 9/11 and as he
waits to speak to the nation.And the Democrats? Barely worth mentioning, except for the Senate's
inability to rouse one senator to protest the sham that chose this
so-called president. Moore's write-off of Daschle, giving him a brief
cameo stating he will endorse Bush waging war on Iraq, is priceless,
just priceless.The heart-rending recording of a mother's grief, with the ultimate
question:"Why?", followed by the piece on Haliburton is neat and clean, and
harks back to Dylan's "Masters of War". And the startled reactions of
members of Congress, when asked for the enlistment of their children,
is as graphic a presentation of the hypocrisy of it all as one could
desire.A jewel of a movie, a mega-bomb of truth.The Old Hag Detroit, Michigan

It seemed pretty obvious to me when watching the film that Moore's
primary target audience was the Average Joe. And keeping that in mind,
he did an excellent job. This movie used a bit of every of the
filmmaker's signature tactics to put together a movie that will finally
send people doing something about it. However, i guess i was expecting
something new or more. All the facts related in the movie are known
stuff to people with any interest in news and politics in general.
Seems we needed someone to put this all together and facilitate the
connections between all of those or maybe Average Joe doesn't have
access to news or no interest in getting them in the 1st place (hint
for Average Joe: The BBC has a website...oh and Fox has The
Simpsons..not news)Of course, now that Iraq had been proven a total fiasco, facts opposing
the war are not so easily dismissed and digging dirt on Bush seems like
an amusing pastime for so many people at the moment that all of these
first overseen facts will finally reach the people that didn't both
listening the first time around.Moore also relies more on the "get your Kleenex" scenes than usual
which is kind of sad. I believe he uses humor so much more successfully
than tears and scenes like that in a documentary always feel kinda
manipulative.Moore's detractors will definitely classify this work as lefty
propaganda. I'm not objecting. Of course it's propaganda. If there's
one thing the republicans easily proved during their time in charge is
that progagandha DO work. Why not fight them on their own ground?While Fahrenheit 9/11 could potentially be more important and initiate
more changes and actions, I enjoyed his previous works a bit more.
Also, most of the issues related in this film is covered more deeply in
either Stupid White Men or Dude, Where's My Country. Anyone who enjoyed
the movie should dig these books if they want more. I also recommend
reading some other works on the subjects just to get a different point
of view. (Another hint for Average Joe: a lot of the footnotes in books
can be tracked on the web when you doubt a quote had been taken out of
context)So while F911 is definitely a must-see, I still give my vote for doc of
the year to The Corporation

I just saw the movie and I loved it. I am neither a republican nor a
democrat. I choose to be a person who votes based on the position the
candidates have. I do have to say that I do have a strong distaste for
President Bush. I do not believe that he truly has the country's best
interest at heart, I think he has his own agenda. But that is beside
the point. I do not want to preach my vote to anyone just as I do not
want someone to preach their vote to me. If anything I would like to
preach peace. I have read several reviews of this movie and I have
found that many people think that Michael Moore has no respect for the
troops. I have no idea what movie they saw but I thought he had a hell
of a lot of respect for the men and women fighting for our country.
Just because he doesn't agree with the war doesn't mean he doesn't
support the troops. I think what we all forget is that those men and
women are fighting so that we can have our separate views. They fight
so that you and I can disagree. Most Americans find pride in the fact
that we are the land of the free, then we criticize those with opinions
that are different than ours. "Yeah I love America, we're the land of
the free unless you have a different opinion than me, in that case get
the hell out of my country." So I think that we should take a minute to
think about how lucky we are to be able to disagree on a topic and not
be persecuted for it. That is what this great nation is all about.

I'm not much of a Moore fan, but I'm not against him either. He usually
gets in his own way and trips over his own opinion in his movies, and
it becomes Just Another Moore Vehicle. This movie, by contrast, does a
really good visual job, and tells a two pronged story. Whether you
believe his story or not, he puts together a non-fictional, yet not
documentary, version of the Bush administration's reaction to 9/11.He starts off with his opinion concerning the 2000 election, which
didn't seem quite apropos to me, but it does set the style of editing.
It also gets the audience full bore into the flippant monologue which
is Moore's chosen way to editorialize. Then he focuses on Bush's
attendance record for a while, before truly coming down to the point of
the movie. It seems vendetta-ish for a while, but when you look at the
movie as a whole you see how Moore is setting up a theme of "how Bush
acts on his responsibilities," which feeds the rest of the film.As a New Yorker, I cried bitterly with my memories when he turned focus
to the terrorist attack on 9/11. However, I was extremely impressed at
how he portrayed it. The editing and choices of footage are surprising
and emotional without being too exploitative, ending in a beautiful yet
desolate metaphor of lost lives. From there the audience is taken to the much-reviewed "7-minute"
scene, which would have been better if Moore hadn't continued with his
very flippant remarks over the top of it. It is still shocking and sad
to watch, though, and while Moore undermines his own work by mocking
speculation of "what the President is thinking," there is no denying
that Bush made a huge mistake at that time. From here onward, Moore weaves his film around the string of mistakes,
miscalculations, and manipulations surrounding the War on Terror that
have plagued the Bush administration. I admit to being politically
bored with the Bush/Saudi connection. It was interesting detective
work, and it was intriguing to know that the people he placed in power
had those corporate connections, but I didn't think it was the terrible
thing Moore did. If Moore didn't think corporate nepotism was alive and
well in American politics on both sides of the fence, that was a bit
naive ;) I was even further annoyed at his "Coalition of the Willing"
montage - I found it unconscionable that he portrayed the countries in
such an arrogant, patronizing light (corresponding Iceland with a movie
clip showing Vikings, and Palau with hula dancers), and neglected to
add more active countries such as England, Poland, and Japan. On the
other hand, once he's gone to footage of the Iraq war, he does a
marvelous job showing the wide and diverse range of opinions in our own
Armed Forces, from deeply inhumane to profoundly introspective and
touching. He also does well when showing the transformation of opinion
that happens to some soldiers and their families. When Moore stops
editorializing and he just films these people talking, or adds
news/media footage from hearings, press conferences, and other public
events, there's an amazing sense of power to the content. Scenes of
soldiers in physical rehabilitation, or scenes of policemen and state
troopers expressing frustration, or scenes of congressmen on both sides
expressing dissenting views - that's where this movie shines. I don't
think I'll ever see any actor express anything as powerful as the face
of the corporal as he makes his stance known. I also think that these
scenes outstrip anything that could be done in a true documentary,
because you can see with great clarity that this is a present-tense
problem and people are still struggling with the ramifications of the
decisions they've made.People who tend to agree with Moore's stances will, of course, adore
this movie. But to anyone who is a fence-sitter, I beg that you go,
ignore Moore's flippant and arrogant editorializing, and just listen to
the people he interviews. Don't let Moore put a wall of resentment up
between you and the voices of the people in his scenes. If you listen,
you will learn things, you will cringe, and you will come away with
something more than what you had when you walked into the theater.

I think this is the truly great movie of the year and don't know how
one can see it and not come away with a changed mind. It belies how
corrupt and immoral George Bush is and what a tangled web of lies the
neo-conservatives in this country wove in order to convince the
American public of the legitimacy of committing the terrible sinful act
of invading Iraq without provocation. This is a wonderful country and I
celebrate the privilege of living the wonderful life I live, here, like
everyone else. For leading use down such an awful path of trepidation,
I think he at least deserves to lose the election in November, and more
so should be impeached. God forgive his soul for abandoning the
American people.

I just want to say, I think it's really cool that a movie could stir up
so much emotion and controversy that the boards are flooded with
chatter about politics. Down with apathy!I appreciate Michael Moore. I think that it's only right that if there
is a Rush Limbaugh, there should be a Michael Moore. It just makes
sense. For every bleeding heart hippie liberal there should be a
cold-blooded, crusty Republican to be a counterpart. That's probably
why our elections always run so close.Just to be fair, I'll admit I tend to agree with Michael Moore. He is
pretty extreme, but I think a lot of people already know that, and are
capable of sorting out the entertaining, over-the-top stuff from the
deeper points he's making. As any movie reviewer will mention right
away, Michael Moore is not trying to be fair or balanced. His
documentaries don't pretend to be objective (not that complete
objectivity in a documentary is attainable).I don't think it's necessary to argue our own personal credentials in
order to have an opinion about the president, the film, or whatever. If
you are a citizen, you can believe what you want and vote how you want.
If you're not a citizen, you can still express your opinion. You don't
need a college degree or a service record or powerful connections to
have a voice.Regarding the president, there are a lot of people with degrees and
military service records who are not necessarily bright, moral, or
capable people. Bush can barely put a sentence together, and that's not
really a secret. It is true he may prefer an "informal" speaking
environment but I'm inclined to think the leader of the Free World
should be able to communicate effectively, in public. This impediment
does not make him a bad president...the things that *do* are reserved
for another message.Peace!

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a mix of political satire, witty comedy, and documentary
all rolled up into one.  It is Michael Moore's love child; a living
testament to his hatred of the Bush administration.  It opens with Gore's
victory celebration on the evening of November 4th, 2000.  You see Ben
Affleck and "that taxi driver guy" as a background to a jubilant Al Gore and
a somewhat vacant Tipper.  Then, suddenly you hear a voice over, Moore of
course, asking you whether this is all a dream.  He proceeds to tell the
tragedy that unfolded on that fateful night and the following weeks and
months of clashing news reporters and weighted, somewhat suspicious court
decisions.  He tells of the folly of the Florida debacle and the terrifying
actions and effects of the Bush administration.Now this was a great film.  It was emotional, it was well written, it was
sprinkled with intelligent humor and terrifying pictures of war.  It is a
masterpiece of cinema.  But it is not your standard documentary.  Things
that are presented as facts are sometimes opinions and half truths.  Moore
has done a brilliant job of splicing together facts that support his views
and leaving out all the rest.  There is a point where he shows clips of
Baghdad before the war.  There are children frolicking in the streets,
weddings happening, old men laughing in a restaurant.  But where are the
torture scenes?  Where are the effects of Hussein's oppressive rule?  I
mean, I know Iraq wasn't full of shiny, happy people.  Saddam Hussein is a
bad guy, and he was oppressive.  There is another point where Moore makes
fun of the "Coalition of the Willing" (which is laughable), but he
conveniently leaves out the larger more respectable countries, like England
and Spain.  Moore has created a great piece of film and a great piece of
propaganda, but it's not the whole truth.I totally agree with everything this film stands for.  I am a far left
democrat and I believe that Bush is one of the worst leaders in the history
of this or any other country.  But I will admit that this is not everything
that is out there.  Everything said in the film is correct.  It's all the
truth, with opinions here and there.  But it is not the WHOLE truth.  So it
should be taken with a grain of salt.Overall, this was a brilliant film.  It was well made and it won the hearts
of the audience (except for those who didn't agree with the film), and it
even won the Palm D'or, the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival.  I
highly recommend it.  I give the film a 92 out of 100.Well, go out and see it.  Please.  And educate yourself about the
surrounding issues, too

I am no American citizen, but here in Canada, we are well aware of the
current status of the United States.  Being both a Liberal and a
Conscientious Objector, I am completely and utterly repulsed at Bush and his
entire propaganda.  What I don't understand is how the public can accept
some bumbling fool, and where are these hidden, almost mythical supporters
that he has? Michael Moore is very much a ray of light in the darkness of
stupidity that exists in this world.  His documentaries have always been
amusing and informative and this one does not disappoint.  After reading his
books that lead up to this film, (i.e. Stupid White Men, and Dude, Where's
my Country?), I knew that this movie would be great.  Mike really can stick
it to the man, or in this case, a stupid, cowardly hick.  I really do hope
that Canada does not duplicate the mistake our neighbours to the South have
done.  Please don't elect Stephen Harper, if you want reasons, see this
movie.

This is an important film, not only in the history of film making but
in the history of the USA. Its implications may very well sway the
course of the next election. Moore's intelligent and sensitive case
against Bush Jr. and the Big Business of War vs. the human face of his
action's realities will move any person with an ounce of heart and an
iota of brain. It's a deftly crafted film, finally giving the people a
chance to see the humanity attached to the actions taken by our
government in the past several years; faces that have been hidden from
view and voices that have been silenced. Thanks so much to Disney for
trying to crush its release. In doing so, they've helped to promote a
film that may ultimately lead to the demise of the Bush regime.
Congratulations to Michael Moore.

This is a must see documentary, especially if you are on the fence
about the coming election. This is the first time I have seen anything
this excellent that tied together all the facts that I have read from a
number of sources. Even if you know all the information in this movie
you will be impressed by how well Moore ties it together. He clearly
shows the Bush family connection with Saudi Arabia, and he is able to
unravel the amazing connections between the administration, favored
corporations, and Iraq. As a Vietnam Vet I appreciate how Michael Moore
supports the troops without supporting the war. Even after hearing all
about this movie it still was beyond my expectation. I plan on seeing
this movie a number of times and then purchasing a DVD.

This film is a brilliant expose of the incompetence and deceit of the
present American administration. Redneck detractors heap abuse on Moore
and the film, but the fact remains that this is a documentary, and
images of Bush and his stooges lying and playing while the world burns,
are accurate.The images and examples of the shocking incompetence, inhumanity, and
greed of Bush and company are too numerous to list here. However, one
scene must be mentioned as an illustration of Bush's incompetence......
When the first plane hit the WTC, Bush was about to visit a public
school in Florida and participate in a photo-op showing him reading
with the children. Instead of canceling this blatant political show
upon hearing about the tragic event, he went ahead and visited the
school. It's pitiful to watch this stupid clueless man carrying on the
charade at the school at the same time that thousands of Americans were
being incinerated or jumping to their deaths in the most serious attack
on the USA in 60 years. And then, an aide comes into the classroom
where Bush is perched uncomfortably on a chair, and whispers in his ear
that the second plane has hit the tower. Incredibly, Bush still carries
on the his photo-op and shows no visible reaction to the news, other
than a dazed, nervous, shifty-eyed expression. Here is the leader of
the free world, paralyzed with indecision because his stooges are not
there to tell him what to do. God help us if anyone launches a full
scale attack on the USA during Bush's sleepwalking watch.See this movie.

I posted yesterday, prior to seeing Fahrenheit 911, that I had many
issues with everyone's bickering about Mr. Moore's film. Enough is
enough... if you bash this film you are being anti-American. Are we not
living in a democracy where we believe in the right to freedom of
speech? Do we not believe in challenging our government (which plenty
of people did when Clinton was in office)? So why is Michael Moore's film such a big deal? Now I have seen it (even though it was so hard to get tickets for it
since all the shows were sold out). So here are my feelings about the
film. I feel the same way that I did when I saw Roger & Me and Bowling
For Columbine. Wait, before you read this, promise to continue after this next
sentence. Fahrenheit 911 is absolutely brilliant. Moore's film should be taken as more of a dissertation on the Bush
Administration's reaction to the horrific events of September 11th,
rather than what one would refer to as cinema verite (if you want that,
go seeControlRoom). While the arguments that Moore makes are just as convincing as they
were with Bowling For Columbine, I have always had a special
appreciation for thequestions that Mr. Moore asks. Personally, I my current MAJOR qualm with Bush is his reasons behind
going to "war" with Iraq. According to Mr. Moore, Americans should be asking a few questions: why
do we have so many more soldiers in Iraq than we do in Afghanistan? Why is there, in fact, a connection between both of the Bush presidents
and Saudi leaders that deals with money? Why did Bush decide to sit in a classroom for 15 minutes (after already
knowing about the attacks on both the Twin Towers and the Pentagon) and
read a children's book with a bunch of elementary school students?And (this is not the last thing to think about) why didn't we hear
about any of these WMD prior to 2001? Why aren't we getting answers that justify these actions and why does
everyone feel the need to hide information that would answer some of
these questions?AND since so many people (not just fanatics like Mr. Moore, but ex-FBI
agents, current politicians, and American soldiers) have made pretty
well thought out claims, why aren't we AT LEAST discussing these
issues? As Americans, true patriotic Americans, shouldn't we all ask what the
hell is going on here? For those of you who want people like Michael Moore to shut up, I would
argue that his being silenced (which was definitely attempted) would be
EXTREMELY unpatriotic. It would. So don't be hypocritical. That's just what I think. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, should go and
see this movie. Honestly, don't go and see it if you don't want to, but don't bash it
until you do. This film might not do anything for you, but it may make
you ask a few more questions. Why are people so afraid to be learn about what's going on in the
world? One last note: The interviews with parents of dead soldiers (including
one with a mother who was, at one point, a Bush supporter) are
particularly poignant, and are worth seeing by all individuals.

On of the rights our country is based on is freedom of speech. This
includes expressing disagreement for how our country is run. Although I
don't agree with all of Michael Moore's opinions, he does make some
very good points in this movie. For the people who say that this film
is "anti-american" and call the ones who view it "traitors", I'd like
to say that freedom of speech and differing opinions are the American
way. It seems to me that when one tries to silence that way by wrapping
themselves in the flag and calling others who disagree "traitors", they
become guilty of their own accusation.I recommend this film.

Don't know how I missed this when it came out....probably something to
do with school or being in a podunk town from which I have to drive 90
minutes to see any sort of movie which is made without the dirty money
of Hollywood. Anyway, having seen Bowling for Columbine which is also a
scabrous, large-hearted, piercing indictment of the peculiar obsession
of Americans for guns, and more recently, Sicko I knew that I had to
see the last of the three tours de force he has released over the last
six years.I believe that what drives conservatives batty about Michael Moore is
that he doesn't read from the Democratic insiders' line on how to frame
his points. He doesn't care if you don't like him. He realizes that the
truth is funny, incisive, and it doesn't kowtow to the supposed
sensitivities of those who might not agree with him politically.
Michael Moore is real. He might be a bit coarse or he might be a bit
scabrous, but he's giving you the truth, straight no chaser. This movie sticks to his formula, featuring some sharp juxtapositions
of images and sound which comment quite acidly on one another along
with his willingness to tell a joke which might not be funny in a light
Tom-n-Jerry way, but which you have to laugh at or you will cry. Flint,
MI features prominently and serves as a representative of Anytown, USA
quite aptly. Moore realizes the emotional heft of using his
unglamorous, blue-collar town as opposed to focusing on those in a
metropolis on the left or right coasts. Many in the middle of the
country do not get a lot of attention from the media and Moore gives
them a voice.......and there are many many people in between the coasts
who are often less wealthy and less educated than those living in the
media-attractive markets on either coast. Flint, MI stands in for
Anytown, USA-affected by layoffs, outsourcing, national political
corruption, and insufficient local civic resources. Moore focuses in his laser-like attention on the inconsistencies and
misinformation fed to the American public and the world and how this
was sold.....and how....when called on it, the Bush cabal further
misled and dissembled, and how this has led us into almost unfathomable
horror and death-and the fact that-as he and a brave soldier make clear
late in the movie, the moneyed and Washington insiders do not see their
children going off to war. He focuses on the hypocrisy of American
foreign policy and how it has aided the Taliban, how we helped Saddam
Hussein in order to fight Iran which we had no sympathy for owing to
the hostages which Iran took in 1979. This does not in any way justify
what happened on 9/11/01, but some history usually enriches our
understanding of events by putting them in the larger context of the
swath of history. Some conservatives like to attempt to suppress
dissent by suggesting that offering context is a means of justifying
the unjustifiable. That is not true. It is, as I said, simply a means
of understanding that things do not happen in a vacuum and as much can
be said for the acts of those whose acts might well be unfathomable.Anyway, the movie itself is a tour de force, one that one could hardly
imagine if it were not true. Foreign intrigue, double-dealing,
inhumanity....but Moore's use of personal narratives in order to thrust
the story forward and ground such unimaginable cruelty and the broad
sweep of macro-events. Moore's sharp wit does not spare anyone who
accedes to the Bush administration's double-dealing with regard to Iraq
regardless of political party, and the fact that more of the crooks at
this time are Republicans is not an indictment of Mr. Moore's focus as
a film-maker.

I believe that most USA citizens curse the attacks to twin towers and
the others but mistreated people related to this disaster are not just
them, also Iraq people, also the whole people all around the world.
After this disaster, middle-east never have found the peace. Primarily
innocent USA citizens around the disaster had suffered, after
Afghanistan, after Iraq and now the most serious one is the chaos in
Middle-East. For example, Lebanon chaos between Israel in 2006, the
corruption of united structure of the Iraq and the terrorist attacks
against Turkey leaking from North Iraq borders.After giving the messages, let me tell about the messages of Michael
Moore in F 9/11. Moore tells us the reality with some simple ways which
contain senators', soldiers', Iraq citizens', soldier's relatives' and
lots of different people's speeches. Split's timings for explaining are
suitable. This documentary made me learn lots of things about 9/11 and
Bush. Bush's connections with Ladin and Saudi Kingdom family got me
amazed and a scene that I had seen it in South Park is remarkable.
According to this scene, black and suburbians would go to fight with
Saddam's soldiers.Finally, forget yesterday, save tomorrow. What do I mean? It's very
clear: There is no mass-destruction weapon in Iran. If USA doesn't take
into consideration the warnings that is made by UN and other countries,
the end of it won't be as it was in Iraq.Bush already confess this reality at the end of the film clearly: If
you fool me only one time, shame on you...

Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004)I won't talk about how good this is; it isn't how you should look at
it. '9/11' is a powerful expose of the relentless mistakes, greedy
miscalculated decisions of a propaganda generating government led by a
fool. While this film shouldn't come as a great shock to any person with some
intellectuality and common sense, it should be an eye opener for
ignorant people. Some will deny what they see, others will brand it as
propaganda and many will be outraged by the irrevocable yet unnecessary
damages of the Iraq war on the people of Iraq and the soldiers and
their families. No Weapons of Mass Destruction have been found, no free democratic Iraq
exists (even if you say it happened, the country is in total ruins and
has become a brutal warzone for freedom fighters (or terrorists pick
one)). However you look at it, Iraq was in more order when Hussein was
in power. Oh, but he was a dictator, a mass murderer. Well so is Bush;
he's orders have killed thousands of innocent civilians, create chaos
and inflame the terrorists anger towards America. Let us pause for one second. One single moment. Imagine you are one of
the people in Iraq or Afghanistan, whose wife and children have been
turned into ashes by American bombs; why would you give a sh*t if you
inflict harm on another nation. Your anger, your fury at a man's
actions sitting on a comfortable custom-made leather chair 8,000 miles
away ordering bombings supposedly for the good of the people. You
think, you stare at the empty desert; what have I got in this world. I
want the Americans to pay for what they did to me. That is the view of
some so called terrorists that we protect ourselves against. Perhaps if
the USA left all the countries alone, countries that the President
couldn't show you, even if you brought him a kid's map, this problem
with terrorism would calm down. Back to Fahrenheit 9/11 - Moore shows us how the government targets the
poorest, most deprived, degenerated areas of the country to lure
hopeless young minds with no futures into a supposedly fruitful career
in the marines. Little do many of these youngsters know that they are
being taken into a hell; into a demoralising, dehumanising zone of
fighting, a place where they could be killed instantly. The Iraq War cost the American people 600 billion dollars; 600 million
million dollars; such money could have halved the country's poverty and
reduced crime rates and improved education; but then again those oil
fields in Iraq, those beautiful reserves are just too good for Texas
Oil Barons and large greedy corporations; the oil is money!According to Moore, from the 500 Congress members, only 1 has enlisted
his son in the army. Funny how the power hungry politicians don't send
their children into the Middle Eastern Inferno that is Iraq; hmm? Of
course the president would enlist his sons, but unfortunately he
doesn't have any; oops, well his daughters are too fine to join the
marines. After all War is only for poor folk; the people who are less
supported by the government are sent to be sacrificed in a pointless,
aimless, endless war. We look at these so called dictators that rule some nations and we
curse their existence. When we look at W. Bush, we may disagree with
his policies; the most we do is call him an idiot(justifiably), but
when you think about it, he is a mass murderer really isn't he? Maybe
not, am I being too cold here. I guess Americans need to preserve their
freedom to invade a country 12,000 km away; take down a dictator who
was provided with weapons by the American government, so they can
restore peace; well guess what: Simply and poetically; The result is a
that the Americans got stuck in a pile of big horse sh*t with a mere
cost of a few billion a year, money enough to develop a West African
country or supply food to millions of struggling families in America. The term 'Evil' can only be judged personally; Hitler killed millions;
Stalin terminated 25 million lives. W has invaded a country, well two
if you really want to count Afghanistan and send the world in a global
panic that has resulted in us waiting hours at an airport and having
been asked to seal our toothpaste or deodorant. Funny how this
terrorism age only really kicked in in the year 2001, same year that W
was elected. Anyway you may disagree, but ultimately you know I am right and you
know that this documentary is solid truth that you and I cringe when we
see it. Severed arms, legless people, mothers crying for their lost sons
whether in Asia or in America, a world growing more unstable by the
minute and that damn search for those Weapons of Mass Destruction,
while the man from Texas cracks jokes with other greasy politicians who
really don't give a sh*t , just as long as their paycheck arrives on
time. More like a vigilant attack on the war, anyway this documentary is a
shocking account of the events that we see on the news every day; the
news that we are so tired of hearing... Another 2 soldiers have died
today, and you see two fresh faced 20 year olds picture on the news...
But do you really care anymore, with all the problems that the world
has. While we plunge into the Global Warming era, pollute and destroy
our Earth; a world where you only really care about yourself, what are
we really fighting for?

"Fahrenheit 9/11" really is without a doubt one of the better
documentaries made, even though political and touchy it's interesting,
educational and emotionally charged. Michael Moore a known and die hard
liberal does it again he really goes after the right wing and
republicans with fangs and claws. Really George W. Bush is portrayed as
greedy, stupid, and corrupt in this film. From the beginning with Moore
giving his take that Bush stole the 2000 election in the Florida
recount by the influence of FOX News and saying that George Sr. had an
impact on the supreme courts decision. Though Moore's main message is
to show that the Iraq war rose due to greed and was fought due to the
Bush family ties to the Bin Laden's oil royalties. Moore gives a strong
opinion that 911 and Iraq in no way were connected, that this is simply
a war for profit and that everything is tied to oil companies and
contracts. The footage is thought provoking and blended with spoof
humor with music to fit what's being told. And the interviews are
revealing and it's blended well with Moore's use of satire and humor.
The pros and cons of the patriot act are shown, the most touching
moment was the emotional interview with Lila Lipscomb a mother from
Moore's Flint, Michigan hometown who lost a son in the Iraq battle, as
she breaks down in tears and travels to the white house in search of
answers as to why are we fighting this war. Moore ends on a good and
funny note by going up to Congress people asking them to enroll their
kids in service to go fight, now that will be the day! Really a great
political doc to watch no matter what your take on the war is, or
regardless of your political leanings you have to hand it to Michael
Moore this was well done material. Judge for yourself if you believe it
or not.

"Fahrenheit 9/11", political opinions aside, is a well made and
intriguing documentary that is by no means boring.As far as politics go, this film just takes a huge bite out of the Bush
Administration. The first third or so of the film seems to just making
fun of Bush. However, this humor is quickly turned upside down by the
last portion of the movie...which is quite upsetting to say the least.I try to be as moderate as I can when it comes to politics, but as far
as Bush Administration goes...everything is just a huge mess. This
movie, while it may seem to exaggerate at some parts, very effectively
eats away our President and his people.

"Fahrenheit 9/11" is - just like "Bowling For Columbine" - a very good
movie.It gives critic on the Bush-government in a very entertaining and

master in making films like this one.The original music for this film by Jeff Gibbs is beautiful, especially
in the beginning and in the end, and the cinematography is also
excellent at some moments.This is a very good film! a lot of people will enjoy it and learn a lot

All politicans are selfish and all their followers have a "what's in it
for me" mentality. And why not when the power to make decisions for
millions is in politics. Farenheit 9/11 is not so much anti-Bush, as it
is disagreeing with Bush administration politics. Moore is a skilled
filmmaker as evidenced by the fact this is the highest-grossing summer
released documentary and one that was banned, too. It's definitely not
a family movie. Personally I found some parts dragging, but by the time
it got to the segments on Iraq, it becomes very engaging, especially
the segment on "terror alerts". What did these Iraq citizens do to
deserve this? And what was the connection to 9/11? People have made up
their minds about this move based on their beliefs, and really that's
politics right there. The Bush administration has already written its
legacy and you can see it in Farenheit 9/11.

The movie was good and well made and surely to turn out imitators as it
well did. Moore's style is unchallenged but I have seen other
documentaries that asks and exposes harder truths on the subject of
911.Alex Jones for one makes documentaries that leaves Moore's look like
child's play. Maybe someday he would make a sequel exposing the deeper
truths into what really happened on- before and after 911. Give us MORE
Micheal Moore, Give us the RED PILL Already! I've been more than ready
to take it,If you want to know how I really feel get the action going
get the cameras rolling MOORE MOORE MOORE!!!

Humans can take about 2 hours of a film, then need a break. Attempting
to cover every detail of a government's abuse of her citizens
confiscated tax dollars in those 2 hours is impossible. Therefore,
producers et al must simply alert the viewer that there is a problem to
consider and then offer tangents for exploration.If a viewer accepts the ideas of a film as truth, the viewer may run
into problems in reality later as ideas in film *by their nature* can
only be superficially examined. The viewer must digest the ideas and
research in depth in order to gain an understanding of "what's going'
on", not simply rely on entertainers to provide conclusions.I cried passionately and openly as I watched the military mom
transition from "rah rah military" to "my son, reimbursed with
confiscated tax dollars in return for his death, is gone forever".Thanks Moore for another upbeat look into my culture.

This movie was OK. He doesn't really have the skill and experience as
some of the other filmmakers, but this film does feel raw and edgy,
(though nothing really new). I'm neither a democrat or a republican, but what bothers me about this
film is the title. He should've researched the title of the movie out
before releasing the film because of copyright of another similar
title. Also, I don't have anything against Mr. Moore, but I think he
rushes his films to get his point across.....maybe to make a buck while
it is a hot topic? If you look at Bowling for Columbine, that was
released very close after the tragedy.Just bit of a warning, this film is very negative and one sided towards
Mr. Bush, and may be offensive to some individuals.

Michael Moore made a very well crafted documentary. It's beautifully
presented and edited, and he has won a number of awards for his film.
I'm not really interested in American politics, but this movie was very
exciting. It opened my eyes. I think many people may think of this a
pure propaganda, and that it is full of Michael Moore's personal
opinions. If you have no prior knowledge you could easily end up eating
Michaels every word. If you have a camera and no conscience it's very
easy to manipulate with people. If you hate George Bush, you'll love
the Bush-hating. If you like Bush, you'll just be amazed that anyone
can take this film seriously. Michael Moore is very controversial.

As a documentary, this film is supposed to shed more light and inform
the general public about a certain event or situation. And 9/11 is
certainly an event,I think, everyone would like to know more about.
After seeing this film, even if it's biased material, I have learned
more about this great tragedy of our time. And also after watching this
film, i had a sick feeling in the my stomach. As part of the American
public, I"m used to being like too. But, the agendas shown here go far
beyond that. To know that the Saud Arabians provide nearly 7% of our
economy was frightening. To watch our President's dumbfounded look and
ten minute rest after he was informed of the 2nd plane hitting was
shocking. And to know that Bush Sr. was meeting with a member of the
Bin Laden family that morning, and that two days later, 124 Saudi's,
including members of the Bin Laden family were flown out of the US,
without being questioned of Al-Queida involvement was appalling. Many
people i've told about this film disregard it, saying it's meaningless
propaganda, as if brainwashed. I'm objective enough to watch this film
and also watch a Bush speech and judge them both on their own merit.
But many others I've talked to are not that open-minded. If even half
of this film's discoveries are the rock-hard truth, we need to vote
Bush out of office because with him will go Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Cheney,
and the ties and money the Bin Ladens have with our Presidential seat.
Even if John Kerry was brain dead, he would prove to be a more rational
and level-headed president than Bush. I highly recommend this film to
any man or woman who will be voting this year.

I liked the fact that Michael Moore has made a great effect on what is
most likely a big documentary with a bold and descriptive way to
storytelling of the Bush Administration. I personally would like to
give a shout out and kudos to Moore since he has done what many
attention grabbing moments in this movie. From the 2000 Bush election
to the terrible tragedies of 9/11, The movie itself describes what is a
eclipsing event to the War in Iraq, Farenheit 9/11 is one of the movies
that would put you to the absolute truth in George W. Bush's
Presidency.For this film it is getting a 10/10! Best and powerful documentary out

Fahrenheit 9/11 successfully attacks the Bush Administration's handling
of the 9/11 terrorist attacks with ample facts and documentation. The movie is propaganda in the sense that it uses facts, ideas and
opinions to advance a point of view. Moore is trying to show how the
Bush Administration dropped the ball on the months leading up to Al
Qaida's attack, and on 9/11 itself...and since.Moore makes a devastating case. He says all the information in 9/11 was
carefully researched and checked before the film was released. Facts
used to advance a case can't be refuted, and for that reason make the
case all the stronger.

FAHRENHEIT 9/11 Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalReleased during an election year with the specific intention of
toppling President George W. Bush from power, Michael Moore's vivid
documentary rails against the Republican administration's incompetence,
arrogance and (alleged) corruption, though it ends up merely preaching
to the converted. Those viewers who SHOULD see the film will have been
deterred by the director's growing reputation as a left-wing firebrand,
and those who ARE persuaded to attend screenings (other than those who
agree with Moore's point of view) will question the film's lack of
balance: Moore levels a range of charges against the Bush presidency,
yet pointedly fails to offer a single dissenting voice, one that tries
to answer the various accusations made against them.And what accusations! Using documentary footage and TV news clips,
Moore outlines the links between Bush's family and the various business
interests who have profited from his presidency; the way in which Bush
was initially viewed as a 'lame duck' president, until his fortunes
were revived by the appalling events of September 2001; the exaggerated
'terror threat' which led to an American-led conflict in Afghanistan
and a second war against Iraq, during which the aforementioned
'business interests' circled like vultures, awaiting the inevitable
(and hugely profitable) outcome; the deliberate targeting of poor
communities by military recruitment officers; and the hundreds of
soldiers killed in post-war Iraq, encouraged by a Senate in which only
ONE Congressman has a family member on active duty in the war zone.
Stunts such as the one in which Moore doorsteps politicians and asks
them to consider 'volunteering' their children for conflict - intercut
with images of disaffected soldiers questioning the entire basis for
the war, along with images of death and suffering on all sides - amount
to little more than sideshow padding, though the point is well taken.To date, the film is the most successful documentary feature in cinema
history, but it failed to dislodge Bush from office (in fact, he
emerged from the 2004 elections in an even stronger position than
before, and Moore has been blamed in some quarters for helping to turn
the tide in Bush's favor). To those who dislike him, Bush comes across
as a drawling, ineffectual goof, and Moore uses edited fragments to
highlight the man's awkwardness and apparent lack of intelligence. But
given Moore's refusal to provide some kind of comeback from those he
seeks to impugn - even if their response did nothing more than confirm
their arrogance and corruption - many viewers will find themselves at
odds with the director's approach, no matter how much they agree with
his reasoning. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is an articulate, compassionate film,
but it raises more questions than it seeks to answer about the forces
which govern our daily lives, and those people in positions of
authority who seek to impose their own particular view of 'freedom' and
'democracy' on an international scale.

I hate George W. Bush, I hate the ideals of the Republican party, I
hate the fact that so many innocent people are dying in vain in Iraq. I
saw this movie the first time thinking that I knew a lot of Bush's
regime and the state of the US, while watching it I realized, I had a
lot more to learn. This film is anti-bush, and I was and still am, and
therefore the film was biased yet a lot of modern political
documentaries are. If you like bush you will hate this film if you are
indifferent, it depends on which side you lean towards more, if you are
democratic or independent, you will like this film. The way this film
is played out is: Topic-Sub Topics-Examples, normally through
individuals-Different topic, this repeats itself but in such a way that
in the end it all wraps up strongly, leaving a lot of people (for lack
of a better term) stunned. It gets under your skin by showing the
inhumane attitude of desensitized soldiers, how gullible the average
American is, and how sneaky the government truly is and how well they
guard their secrets. The music and montages drive this film forward and
at the end, the quote from George Orwell's "1984" Fits well with the
theme of a doomed future, the music it accompanies drives the point in
a hypnotic way and by the time the ending credits roll, you feel ready
to actually do something. And though at times it seems that he exploits
Lila Lipscomb, it is still a film that no one should miss, if you care
for the state of the US or the world (lets face it the US thinks it
owns the world) watch it.10/10

I remember exactly where I was when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and
George Bush (Sr., that is) took on Saddam. I was a Freshman in high
school studying for a U.S. History exam. Unfortunately, I can't
remember what part of history the test covered. I would like to believe
it was manifest destiny or something ironic.I came downstairs for a break and my dad told me a war was on. Despite
larger TVs, he and my mom were huddled around the small one in the
kitchen. It didn't feel real. It was on television. CNN had live feeds.
Wasn't this all a show? It was to this mindset that Michael Moore has
made his newest film, Fahrenheit 911. Moore takes on President George
W. Bush in a way that cannot be cataloged as criticism, rather an out
and out attack. Moore links Bush to the Saudi's, Saddam Hussein, and
the Fox News channel of all places. Some of these links admittedly seem
shaky and it went by so fast an average viewer would need notes and a
family tree in some cases to truly figure it all out. However, as with
Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me, The Big One, and his television
shows, it is the broad strokes with which we should adhere.Much of Moore's "evidence" is at best circumstantial and is reported
only to back his own opinions. I read an article written by Brittany
Craigo, reportedly a seventeen year old Bush supporter, posted on
moorelies.com. She makes good points but believes F911 is "a new form
of Leni Riefenstahl-like propaganda." This is clearly over the top.
Comparing Moore to the Nazi advertising machine is unfair since Moore
makes it clear in this and all of his other films that these are his
opinions. The tone for his films is a satirical, tongue-in-cheek
playfulness that entertains first and informs second.The attacks on his film remind me of the surge of criticism Oliver
Stone endured while releasing JFK. Why is it so "dangerous" and
"harmful" for films like these to be released? Do I sit in the theater
and blindly stare at the screen and drool in my popcorn believing
everything Michael Moore is telling me? Of course not. Just as I did
not hang on every word of Craigo's article.The problem is that leftists will show up to the film in droves and
love it, right-wingers will debunk everything, even when there is
nothing to debunk. Moore wants the rest of us to watch. The majority of
America is moderate. In the current climate of media-fueled stories and
shallow political attacks, it is difficult to take anything seriously.The public is flanked from all sides with reasons to vote for this
person or that person; this cause or that one. Moore boils it all down
into two helpful servings: 1) This is your president as I see him; 2)
Despite the partisan, childish attacks and eye-rolling political ads,
this is all important. Take it seriously. ***.5 out of ****

I wouldn't say that i was shocked to see this movie. I mean I have
always had these conspiracy theories in my mind but I never believed
that those could be true. This movie just put it all together.. I mean
it clearly exhibits how a nation was fooled by its own leaders.. Anyone
who claims that the facts presented in the movie were in fact
fabricated, should at least come up with a few specifics.. I mean i cant
forget the look on Mr. Bush's face when he was informed about the
terrorist strikes on 9/11. The guy had no clue as to what had happened
to him. That was surely the best part of the movie.The funnier part though, is that the same guy was re elected for
another four years by hi "fellow Citizens"... I mean com'on... how can
a person so clueless can be the president of the most powerful and
civilized nation...I just hope that Mr. Moore continues his excellent work and in Mr.
Bush's next term, give us at least another one his mater pieces...

[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]It all began on the eve of the 2000 presidential election. All of
America awaits to hear who will be the next president of the United
States of America? Al Gore or George W. Bush? The votes were all
counted and TV news stations all over the country name Al Gore the
winner. However, soon after, someone at Fox News reports that due to a
recent re-count, George W. Bush won by just ONE vote. So all the other
news channels retracted their earlier statements. Apparently one
another reason Bush won was because he had some inside friends. Well,
Bush is inaugurated in 2001 and the precession was anything but
traditional. And he spent the first several months of his presidency on
vacation. Was this all a dream? I'm afraid not. George Bush's
presidency did not get off to a good start, and many of the people
thought Al Gore was cheated. Several members of congress tried to
address Gore on the matter, but he had to act like a jerk and state
that unless the report submitted followed proper procedure, he was not
interested. And interestingly enough, the folks trying to address him
were African American. Well from January to August, 2001, not a whole
lot happened, but one morning on September 11, 2001, the world was in
for the biggest tragedy as well as the biggest national disaster in
history. For a plane hijacked by terrorists crashed into one of the
World Trade Center buildings in New York City. Panic and chaos was
everywhere. The tower fell! Meanwhile, George Bush was in Florida at
that moment about to visit an Elementary School. As soon as the second
WTC tower fell, someone came in the school to inform Bush what had
happened. He was told we were under attack. Well, not having a clue
what to do, Bush just continued reading My Pet Goat to the kids. But
even if he had a clue, what could he have done? I remember where I was
when the towers fell. It was 7:00 AM where I live so I was asleep. It
wasn't until my mom woke me up and told me what had happened. And since
I live close to the airport, it was the first time in probably ever
that I heard no planes taking off. Roughly 3,000 people lost their lives on September 11, 2001. Among
them, brave firemen who, thinking nothing of themselves but for the
safety of those trapped in the towers, rushed in and didn't come out.
Who was responsible for this chaos? Afghan terrorist Osama bin Laden,
that's who. Bush had been told a month prior that bin Laden had been
planning an attack on the U.S., but Bush paid it no mind. Now you're
not gonna believe this, but the Bush family are actually business
partners with the bin Laden family! Saudi Prince Bandar, or Bandar Bush
as they call him at the White House, and he's got an account in the sum
of over $800 billion! So on September 13, 2001 when flights were still
being restricted, the bin Laden family all got to fly home on private
jets!! The family of the man responsible for 9-11 and nobody was
questioned! Bush immediately sent troops into Afghanistan to get Osama
bin Laden. But they came home with nada. And as time went on, people
were being hassled just for saying things about Bush or bin Laden or
Afghanistan in public, and even small neighborhood peace organizations
were infiltrated. And the airport security was no help to anybody.
Apparently Bush and his team wanted to induce enough fear of terrorism
into everyone so that they would support him. As for the situation in
Afghanistan, Bush said he wasn't really spending that much time on it.
To quote Michael Moore, just what kind of president is he? Well, the
state of Oregon only had a total of 8 police troopers on duty, thanks
to budget cuts. But worse was yet to come. Since he couldn't find bin
Laden, Bush decided to finish what his father started and catch Sadaam
Hussein in Iraq. Until now, the Iraqis had never attacked America or
ever threatened to or even killed one American citizen. Iraq was a very
friendly and peaceful country. But then the bombs fell, and many
peopleincluding women and children, fell victim. And so began a huge
war in Iraq where over 800 American soldiers lost their lives. George
Bush's initial plan was to just go in, take over Iraq and bring freedom
to the country. But soon, Iraq struck back! Even more bodies pile up.
Several soldiers are interviewed. Some think it's all a game while
others feel it isn't a gloriful experience. We go on to see horrific
and macabre pictures of innocent people who fell victim to the
bombings. We can also see both sides to this whole matter so we know
the Iraqis posted no immediate threat at the time. As you know, of late
2003, they finally captured Sadaam Hussein and he is currently in
prison. But what was his crime? He didn't hate Americans. He hated his
own people. For a long time Bush and his administration had been
telling us that Sadaam had weapons of mass destruction, but we soon
discover he never did. What low blow! With the rising number of casualties in Iraq, they needed more troops.
Now the unfortunate thing is that people who have no money and can't
get a job enlist in the service which pays you a hefty sum for school.
But that isn't good when there's a war going on and guess who's gonna
go fight in it? You. They're tried to recruit more and more people, and
fortunately did not start the draft. Because then people like you and
me would have to go and fight whether we liked it or not. One such
woman, Lila Lipscomb, was deeply saddened over the loss of her son who
was killed in Iraq. She was so upset she went all the way to Washington
D.C. to give Bush a piece of her mind, but could not get into the White
House. Well, the war effort in Iraq raged on. In war, there are no real
winners.Well what can I say about Fahrenheit 9/11? GREAT FILM! Michael Moore is
brilliant. I take back every negative thing I ever said about him and
his films. I used to think he was just a self-promoter wanting to cash
in on all the tragedies of our country. Boy was I wrong! He did a very
good job with this movie. He got ALL the facts. It shows a real dark
side to George W. Bush. I never would have guessed that the president
of the United States of all people, was in league, so to speak, with
the family of a terrorist! The terrorist responsible for September 11!
You HAVE to check out this film today. Republican or democrat, either
one, this is a movie for YOU. It will really make you consider who to
vote for in November. You can vote for whoever you like, but I really
recommend you don't vote for Bush, because if we get this meatball for
2004-2008, the war in Iraq will continue and a lot more people could
get hurt and die. We don't want that. So heed the words of Michael
Moore. A lot of this documentary is really unbelievable and it will
really grab you. For all you people who think George W. Bush is a great
president like his father before him, WATCH THIS MOVIE and then
reconsider that notion. See it today, but brace yourself for some
disturbing images. No more graphic than what's on the newsThat's
probably because it was on the news. I recommend Fahrenheit 9/11. -

Michael Moore. Director and Writer of Bowling for Columbine. Micheal
Moore. Now director and writer of Fahrenheit 9/11. This truly is the
best documentary of all-time in so many ways, whether you're talking
about Box Office Gross to opinions. This is Michael Moore's way of
making film for all of us in audiences all over. This movie may get very gory and gruesome. Remember, this is real life
gore, not Hollywood so parents, beware. There is also another problem
however and you don't have to see the film to know it, one word:
"Propaganda".Michael Moore constructs a brilliant film on the terror attacks of
September 11, 2004. Much like Bowling for Columbine, you will enjoy it
and understand it in a way that when you finish watching the movie, you
will say to yourself that you actually learned something. Fahrenheit
9/11 really delivers and Moore gives solid direction as we see him
learn more information on the subject. Just the 15-minute prologue will
get you hooked with it's unexplainable atmosphere of terror but logic
and the idea of actually being interested while watching a documentary.Overall, This is an amazing film. Definitely one of the best of 2004.
This movie should be shown to classes all over. Even, my nephew saw it
with me and said that his History teacher will show it to their Grade 9
class when the DVD comes out. F 9/11 truly is a masterpiece by Moore
and we will continue to watch Moore's accomplishments as this movie
heads into the 2005 Oscars and with Moore's already announced 2005
release, Sicko talking about our Canadian Health Care System. Then, I'm
sure Moore will please us again with Fahrenheit 9/11 1/2 in 2007. Moore
will bring you the heat again with Fahrenheit 9/11.My Rating: 8/10Eliason A.

This is the greatest and most important creation in any journalistic
medium in the history of world civilization thus far. All journalism,
whether spoken or written, has been created specifically toward the
purpose of the creation of "Fahrenheit 9/11" and its noble mission of
defeating the most incompetent President in American history. Speaker's
Corner, the Gutenberg Bible, the Zenger trial, "Poor Richard's
Almanac", the Hearst empire, wartime newsreels, radio and television,
the Internet, the New York Times...all important, to be sure, but mere
stepping stones to this pinnacle of the world's quest thus far to bring
the truth to the people.12 out of 10...10 for excellent film-making and 2 extra stars because it
has the greatest mission ever for a film.

Michael Moore, he not exactly subtle but at least he's out there putting out
a message we can take or leave.Fahrenheit 9/11 isn't exactly the extreme implausible banter that's be
published by pro-republicans, but it is a film that should not be watched by
anyone who can sit back and believe EVERYthing on screen. That said, it's
damn good: a tighter film that Moore's previous, even though it lurches from
one topic to another. It's essentially Moore's criticisms of Bush and the
presidency since he took office. Of all the points made, the most shocking
(especially to a Brit) is the news coverage and advertisements in the USA,
it seems in line with the TV footage in Paul Verhoven's Starship Troopers,
and that is honestly more shocking than what we are shown of Bush's career
and links to Osama. Even though Moore doesn't go so far he almost, and he
really stands back but putting 2 and 2 together Moore puts Iraq, Saudi
Arabia, Osama, Sept 11 next to each other and although we are not given any
big answers, we are given that statement that it's "Uncomfortable".I'm not a Bush hater, even though I lean left, I don't why hating someone
you don't actually know is just. If going in you've not political opinion
(you probably will), Bush will either come across as a failure with the
right friends, or a charismatic fella in the wrong job. Oh and even though
Moore plays it for laughs, Bush's Discovery of the second plane is no
laughing matter, personally it's one of the most iconic moments of this
century.8/10 for the fact it exists.

I sat through the entire thing, with a sick feeling in my stomach. I was one
of those who supported the need for 'something to be done about Iraq'.
However, in the time since the war began - I would read bits and pieces from
media (not controlled by corporate interests) and started to question some
of the claims made by the coalition. This documentary consolidated all those
facts into a coherent and devastating journey, following the greed of a few
and apathy of many. Since the middle of last year - I've come to the
sickening conclusion that I was manipulated by the rhetoric and fear
espoused by those with a vested interest in seeing profits in death and
destruction -  what made it so much worse was that I was complicit in this
ruse.I thought this doco represented a fair and accurate summation of what should
be viewed by the whole world as a tragedy for and travesty against humanity.Michael Moore and many of the people who were interviewed deserve the
highest praise for speaking out - Courage is seeing wrong and speaking out
against it, cowardice is staying silent or apathetic.I thoroughly recommend this documentary.

'Burn Motherf!' We can't stop singing this song! Black Humor yes but
not insensitive public. It reminds instantly an old advertisement
against famine in Africa where starving children are filmed in a dry
sandy parcel, searching the ground for grains to eat, while funny music
is being played over the pictures then a catchphrase pops up in the
middle of the screen, saying: 'Are you shocked by this music choice?
Well you shouldn't! It's the image you should look at!'.Amazing how people can change history... or maybe not? But at least one
man edited one of the most important periods of history, an important
documentary that will be produced later on DVD and assist/help
humanity, giving the chance to all generations in the USA and the whole
word (present and future time) to reveal the other side of what they
might call "real history". At least the future generation will be able
to decide if Michael Moore was right or not about his thoughts! This is
a movie that will probably be a unique reference to students,
historians, politicians, NGO's, anyone! This reference will have more
impact in 10 years (wait and see). This cinematographic work is more
than a simple documentary made with archives and images: it carries
Moore's personal point of view, a lot of people opinions and a
convincing intelligent analysis evaluating all images and news we
'swallow' everyday on TV!What if?What if all what Moore said was wrong? Well for only being a valuable
'movie' (more than a simple documentary), Fahrenheit 9/11 deserves the
2004 Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm!

This documentary exposes the George W. Bush administration for the
Evil, though incompetent, Empire that it truly is. From Dick Cheney's
Haliburton cronyism to the Bush family's close ties to the Bin Laden
family and to the Saudis in general. The film starts with the
Republican theft of the 2000 presidential election and follows with the
tragic events of September 11, 2001 and President Bush's actions (or
lack thereof) in the aftermath of the terrorist attack. The film is
presented in large part in a rather lighthearted fashion, but becomes
rather intense at times. There is film/video footage from the streets
of war-torn Iraq, for example. In addition, the up-close interviews
with a woman who lost her son to the Iraq conflict are quite moving and
at one point, shows her doubling over at the grief she feels. This
woman is a typical patriotic American, who believed in the necessity
for military action and trusted the President as a leader to take all
necessary precautions to ensure troops safety and not endanger them
needlessly. This trust was, of course, hopelessly misplaced. I saw the
film in Humble, Texas, a very conservative suburban community near
Houston, but immediately after the film, the crowd burst into
spontaneous applause. I doubt very seriously that anybody seeing this
documentary will be filled with confidence in the Bush administration,
nor will they feel a burning desire to reelect George W. Bush. I have
heard that in some cities groups have lined the exitways coming from
the theaters and offered voter registration cards to any who wanted
them. Michael Moore, who also did the marvelous documentary "Roger and
me" about the disinterest and lack of compassion of corporate
executives for the everyday people (and their jobs) whom their
decisions affect. Moore also made the much acclaimed "Bowling for
Columbine". I heartily recommend this film to persons of any and all
political leanings as informative, entertaining, and moving and believe
that it will provide a much better understanding of the mechanics of
government, or at least of THIS administration. Though there is an
unmistakable message to the film, there is limited editorializing, with
the film preferring to let the film/video clips of actual events and
interviews speak for themselves. I believe that this film should be
required viewing for every registered voter in America. The message one
is left with is one that resounds with most Americans at this point I
think, one of being unsure of John Kerry and what solution he
represents, but of being quite certain that George W. Bush and his
administration have got to go.

Moore does an incredible job at developing a convincing case against
President Bush.  While the extreme right keeps pointing to some errors in it
(and yes, I read the Christopher Hitchens' essay), it is not enough to
derail the overall message of this movie.If you haven't seen this movie yet, go.  And if you can, take a Republican
friend with you.  I can only hope that when this gets its video release in October before the
election, all of those that didn't want to spend movie theater prices will
be willing to watch it when it's only $3.  God help us if Bush gets
re-elected.

The White House has taken Osama Bin Laden off the "Ten Most Wanted"
list. They have put on Michael Moore instead. Moore's film which
smashed its way through a cordon of corporate censorship is an
astonishing work of film journalism. The job which a good journalist or
an honest politician (hah!) ought to be doing is being done by a TV
comic and done brilliantly. Understandably the establishment has pulled out all the stops to
rubbish Michael Moore but the facts in the film speak for themselves
and the Republicans have failed to address a single one of those facts.The links between Bush and the Saudi Royal Family - undisputed.The assistance given to the Bin Laden family to flee America -
undisputed. The pressure on the intelligence services to "prove" Iraq
the villain of the piece and exonerate Saudi Arabia - undisputed. There are two points in the film where anyone not made out of stone (or
New Labour!) would be moved to tears. They both show mothers crying out
in anguish against the war...one Iraqi and the other a patriotic
right-wing democrat from Moore's home town of Flint. Another memorable figure is the army corporal who said "he would not go
back to Iraq to kill other poor people" on behalf of the corporations
who are then shown gloating about the wealth which they can reap from
Iraq. In a priceless sequence Moore approaches US politicians to see how many
of them will sign up their sons to go and fight in Iraq......guess how
many takers he gets..... Go and see the film. Take the family.

While I am not quite as rabid as Moore is, my anger has been building
ever since Bush took office. I have been told for three years that
because I don't support Bush or his atrocities, I am "anti-American."
It doesn't matter that this nation is my home, nor that I love the land
I live in. I have been belittled into being silenced. But thanks to
Michael Moore's film, I've discovered that there are thousands-- if not
millions-- of people out there as angry as I am, who are sick of
watching our nation be destroyed by the man who was supposedly elected
to lead us. We will be silenced no longer.Moore's film is extremely biased, but no more so than the "news" we've
been fed for the last three years. If even a tenth of what he discusses
is true, it is damning. Everyone, regardless of political leanings, needs to see this film.
Even if you hate Michael Moore, watch it to get the other viewpoint
that we've desperately needed for a national dialogue since September
11th. It's time to start talking about what Moore has raised-- because
only with discussion (rather than the belittling) can we repair this
great nation and move forward.

This is a must see movie if, you want the truth on the Bush
Administration and what's been done behind your back. Michael Moore
exposes Bush for what he really is, An incompetent idiot that thought
he could fool us all. He's a warmonger and wants to be a dictator, as
long as it's him. He says it would be easier.???Michaela Moore has Bush's war record before it was blacked out by Bush,
he got it in 2000 when no one was questioning it. Much more you never
new. No spin has been put on this movie like the right wing media does,
Don't be fooled by Bush again. See the movie, then vote. We've all be
had for money and power. Both Bush's are running the white house and,
this country is still in a mess. That's probably why Bush SR. was never
voted back in...I've seen it twice, Both times people were yelling at Bush in the
audience, both times there was a standing ovation after the movie.
Probably the most important film of this century. This is the most
secretive white house ever, Now it's not. Watch how Bush cared about
September 11th. He did nothing but read a book. My Pet Goat and worried
if we were going to find out that he was in bed with OBL. Watch the 2
month head start he gave OBL so we couldn't catch him. Hear that he was
after Iraq before he stole the presidency. Not for WMD as we were told
and none were ever found. Watch how Baghdad was before we invaded and
then after. You'll be surprised. People left crying. A+++ Movie. Hats
off to Michael Moore for having the guts to take on Bush and open our
eyes. I will not vote for him again, even though he didn't win to begin
with.

This documentary was a short time coming. You could just tell that
Michael Moore was itching to make it as soon as possible. Even some
parts in Bowling For Columbine stray to attack Bush. Even when Moore
won an Oscar for best documentary, what does he do? Make some comment
about gun safety? Dedicate it to the lives lost at Columbine? No, he
bad mouths Bush. We all remember his little "fictitious times" speech.
Well, now we have Fahrenheit 9/11, a full-fledged attack on Bush and
his war in Iraq. I like this movie better than Bowling For Columbine
for sure. It's much more focused. BFC raised all sorts of questions
that Moore either couldn't answer, or answered sloppily. This time
around it's clear that the main message is that he, and many others,
are against American President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Oh,
and another thing I liked was that Moore appeared on-screen less. Thank
God.This is a terrific sort of time capsule of the last 4 years. As always,
I suspected that not all Moore's facts were straight. But then again,
I'm sure Oliver Stone likely didn't get all the facts straight about
Richard Nixon when he did a movie about him. By now, I think Moore
expects people to realize that this film is less of a hard-fact
documentary, and more of a commentary. Besides, the most important
things in the movie are not fake. You can't fake the fact that Bush won
the presidency under mysterious circumstances, you can't fake the
attack on the world trade center, and you can't fake the war taking
place right now in Iraq. It's a typical Moore film. He makes all the same mistakes as he does in
Bowling For Columbine. For the most part it keeps your attention, but
certain parts just drone on and on, and in the last half hour it gets
so sickeningly sappy and manipulative that you just don't care anymore.
The very last line of the film is a riot, though. A true Bush classic.
It's worth seeing just for that, and as I said, Fahrenheit 9/11 is
better than Bowling For Columbine. Just slightly better, though. It's
not great, but it is good. Good enough that I think it's important for
everyone to see it now, while its playing in theatres. Don't wait for
video. My rating: 6/10

"Fahrenheit 9/11" is worth the effort to see.  It is one of Michael Moore's
more political films.  It is well done, and leaves a powerful impact.  Of
course, Mr. Moore slants the presentation toward his own personal viewpoint.
 However, despite that fact, it still has information organized in a logical
way that is quite convincing.  This is an election year.  And the timing of
the release of this movie is unique to the upcoming vote for President of
the United States.  I can only venture to guess that the DVD will be
released in September or October, even closer to the actual election.  After
seeing this film, one can understand why it has been such a very great
financial success.

It was admittedly with some trepidation that I went to see Fahrenheit
9/11, the new film by outspoken activist Michael Moore. I found his
last film Bowling For Columbine to be somewhat simplistic and strident
in tone in a way that immediately polarized people. Moore's latest,
however, is a sprawling but focused documentary that makes its points
effectively without being overbearing and, after the first fifteen
minutes, becomes a powerful and moving cinematic experience. It is also
a highly entertaining film, filled with comic touches and genuine human
emotions that may make you laugh one minute and cry the next but is
guaranteed to make you think.Moore starts off on shaky ground, providing a superficial take on the
election of 2000. Calling the Supreme Court's decision a gift from
Bush's cronies, he ignores the fact that the Court based its decision
on the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, taking into
account the fact that there were no uniform standards in Florida to
discern the intent of the voter on unintelligible paper ballots. Moore
also takes a few cheap shots at President Bush, inferring bewilderment
from his lack of immediate reaction after the attack on September 11th
and showing the President repeatedly golfing, hunting, or fishing, the
kind of activities that every President from the beginning of the
Republic has done to relieve the stress of office. The film becomes
more convincing when it strips away Bush's common-man persona and
illustrates the connections of the Bush family to Texas oil and the
influence of Saudi billionaires. While the Bush, Saudi, Oil connection
has been well documented in the past, this sequence makes the elitist
nature of the current government much more real to a large number of
people.Moore makes us feel the tragedy of 9/11 very deeply by showing a blank
screen filled with the sounds of tragedy, leaving the horror to our
imagination. After the initial shock of 9/11, awareness opened and
people came together, yet, in the words of Tim Robbins, "the media and
the government worked overtime to close it and reinforce the usual
trance with mindless fear and insatiable material greed". Moore relates
how perpetuating the fear of terrorism allowed the government, through
the Patriot Act, to trample on civil liberties. Using a loudspeaker, he
drives through Washington DC to read provisions of the Act which
apparently few legislators read before voting it into law. Moore
ratchets up the anti-Bush rhetoric but wisely shows the deeper issues
involved in American society, issues that did not begin with and will
not end with the removal of President Bush. Showing boarded-up homes
and poverty-stricken neighborhoods in his hometown of Flint, Michigan,
he dramatizes how the poor and unemployed are used by the system to
feed war profits. Moore follows two Marine recruiters as they target
young blacks at a shopping mall in a depressed neighborhood, cynically
promising them careers in music and sports. The most powerful sequence deals with Iraq. Here Moore shows scenes of
devastation that we have never seen on television, not only the
slaughter of innocent Iraqi's but also the severed limbs and torn
bodies of U.S. soldiers. Moore questions the reasons we invaded a
sovereign country that was no threat to us, providing a moving sequence
with a patriotic mother who turned against the war after one of her
sons was killed. The mother, Lila Lipscombe, tells Moore how she hung
the American flag outside of her home daily and how her daughter served
in the Gulf War but now questions our government's veracity in the
light of the Iraq War. In the film's emotional highlight, she reads a
letter from her son written weeks before his death, criticizing the
leadership of President Bush and our reasons for being in Iraq. Moore concludes with the words of George Orwell: 'The war is not meant
to be won, but it is meant to be continuous... the war is waged by the
ruling group against its own subjects, and its object is not
victory...but to keep the very structure of society intact.' In his
superb film, Moore raises issues that are rarely talked about in the
mass media, opening our minds to previously inaccessible facts and
images. The ending is a powerful reminder that fundamental change is
needed to end the military mentality and corporate elitism that has
dominated our government, change that goes beyond Bush, perhaps even
beyond politics toward a reinvigoration of the human imagination and
consciousness. Mr. Moore has stated that his intention in making the
film is to influence the outcome of the next election. If the fact that
three million people saw the film in its first weekend is any gauge,
the film may prove once again that one person with courage and
conviction can truly make a difference.

If you've heard your conservative friends (who probably HAVEN'T SEEN the
movie) complain that there are all kinds of 'lies and manipulation of facts'
arguements.  If you've heard your liberal friends speak of it then you've
probably heard the standard "lot's of good info that needs to come out"
arguement.  I just saw the movie and watched with an open mind fully
expecting to be subject to lots of mis-information and what did I find?  It
didn't really provide any new information for me.  However, I'm a Bush-watch
person and keep up with his actions and in-actions.  Everything I saw was basically the same things I've been trying to tell
people for a year now....things people are either shocked to hear and
incredulous or things they're not willing to hear because they don't want to
believe it.  It's probably NOT going to change your mind about anything, but
you need to come to any arguement with your guns loaded....see this movie or
be out gunned.  There are things within your government that just look wrong, ethically and
morally, this movie will provide you a starting point for understanding
those things if you're not that well informed.Love Bush or hate the man, see this movie.

Michael Moore's magnificent Fahrenheit 9/11 treats President Bush and the
Bush administration with great gentility and undue deference. Although
excoriated on the right and left for Anti-Americanism and even hatred of the
American war effort in Irak, Michael Moore patriotically without
compensation took to the streets to inveigh with US Congressmen to enlist
their sons and daughters in the US ARMY. I can't imagine a higher service Mr
Moore could do for the war effort.Throughout this war there has not been the credibility gap of the Vietnam
era but a reality gap. Our Establishment Press reports that wounded
servicemen are screaming to be allowed to return to Irak to finish the job.
When interviewed by Michael Moore, these invalids do plenty of screaming but
curiously did not mention any requests to return to combat duties. Michael Moore employs a certain confrontational style in his form of
journalism that is a refreshing break from the politically correct nonsense
that appears in print.

     I know I'm going to be getting a lot or criticism about this movie; at
least I think I am, so here we go. First of all, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is a
documentary.  Now I know some people are going to be saying,
"Documentary!?!?!  What are you nuts?!?!?  This movie is very bias and one
sided!"  Ah yes, that's true.  This movie is very one sided.  However,
aren't most documentaries one sided?  
    THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE (a great documentary) discusses what a
great man Robert Evans was for Hollywood.  THE FOG OF WAR, McNamara's view
of the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam War.  SUPER SIZE ME, the American consumption
of fast food is damaging our health.  These three films are all considered
documentaries, and they all take one side of the issue.  The only recent
documentary that I can think of that stays in the middle of an issue and
gives the facts, is the excellent ONE DAY IN SEPTEMBER.
    But FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is indeed quite a movie to see because Michael Moore
does bring up questions about our "War on Terror."  The beginning of the
film was very satirical with the results of the 2000 election with Al Gore
announced as the winner and stating "Was this really a dream?"  Then the
first eight months of what Bush did in office by going on vacation a lot
(which I do remember, Bush was usually on vacation).
Then the very tragic day of September 11th 2001.  Moore does a great job
with this film by not actually showing the iconic images of 9/11 with the
planes hitting the World Trade Center towers.  Instead he just shows a
pitch-black screen with the audio noises of 9/11.  I've been talking to
quite a few people about this scene and I've received a lot of
interpretations of this.  "We've seen the images so much that it is in our
memories forever."  "Giving us the feel of what it must have been like for
the people who were in the WTC towers, with chaos and confusion."  Then
Moore shows us the horror and look on the people's faces as they look up
towards the sky, bawling at what they were witnessing.
  Moore then shifts focus with the Bush family and their connections to the
Bin Laden family.  Now quite a few people will be denying that the Bush
family had anything to do with the Bin Laden's, but Moore does discuss
business deals and partnerships that were shown with photos and clippings
from newspapers that do give pretty good support of his argument (I've taken
a university argumentation class last spring and Moore does give evidence
and warrants for his claims).  Plus seeing a video footage of Rumsfield
shaking hands with Hussein in 1983 does make the viewer question the Bush
Administration's past.
  Moore does explain other issues including the infamous, going to war on
terror, by going to war on Iraq issue.  It is interesting to see a different
side on the War in Iraq compared to major news networks repetitive footage
of U.S. soldiers in Iraq, with the troops standing around like police
officers, or seeing a tank roll by.  Moore shows the viewer footage of some
of the U.S. soldiers excitement of power and control.  Such as the scene
where a solider discusses blasting a heavy metal song that has the lyric
"the roof is on fire."  While other scenes show other U.S. soldier who
question why the Iraqis don't seem pleased that the U.S. troops are over
there.  Then when footage is shown of children killed and houses destroyed,
you begin to wonder yourself.
  FAHRENHEIT 9/11 does have some very emotional scenes, such as Lila
Lipscomb's story, a Flint, Michigan resident whose son was killed in Iraq. 
One can't help but feel emotional and supportive of Mrs. Lipscomb.  Then
when Mrs. Lipscomb arrives at the White House in tears, only to have a
Bush/Iraq supporter harass Lipscomb by saying "this is all staged!"  A viewer can't help but to show pain and anger at the same
time.
  Or shock and anger when a Taliban official was visiting the White House in
early 2001, and a female reporter comments how horrible the women in
Afghanistan.  Only to have the Taliban official make a comment, "I feel
sorry for you husband with what he has to go though with
you."
  Or the scene with President Bush sitting in the Florida classroom for an
extra 7 minutes reading along with the class "My Pet Goat" as Moore gives
commentary with "what was Bush thinking at the time?"
  FAHRENHEIT also has some very hysterical scenes, Paul Wolfowitz footage
before getting ready for a TV interview by placing the teeth of a comb in
his mouth to pat his hair down, then licking his hand to pat the hair down
again.  Some of the footage of the comments that Bush makes including the
comment "you are my home base." John Ashcroft singing the very hysterical
song "Let the Eagle Soar."  And my personal favorite, Britney Spears
smacking her gum and giving allegiance to G.W.
  After watching FAHRENHEIT 9/11, I put on my copy of the Pink Floyd (or
mostly Roger Waters) album THE FINAL CUT.  FINAL CUT is a concept album
about the scarred memories of wars from the past and the continuation of war
right now. the album was released in 1983, and it's disturbing how the
message still stands 21 years later. THE FINAL CUT is an excellent companion
piece to listen to after viewing FAHRENHEIT 9/11.
   Although FAHRENHEIT is not as humorous or entertaining as Moore's BOWLING
FOR COLUMBINE.  Yet, FAHRENHEIT, I feel is a better and more important
picture than COLUMBINE.  FAHRENHEIT deals with our leaders, the people who
control the free world.  Yet do our leaders deserve the creditability they
get from the media? (especially the Fox News Network).
   Legendary filmmaker Jean Luc-Godard said, "The way to criticize a film is
to make another film."  So if Conservatives are upset with FAHRENHEIT 9/11,
why don't they make a movie supporting Bush and the war in Iraq earlier? 
Now that FAHRENHEIT was #1 at the box office, the Republican Party is making
a Bush documentary.  I am willing to see the film, however, I am curious to
see how well they use their warrants and evidence with the claims they make
on how great a President G.W. is.  
    Michael Moore has said on numerous interviews that he only had one
objective with FAHRENHEIT 9/11, to get people to vote in this November's
election.  Now whether you support Moore or not, no one can't deny that
because of this film, people are ready to go out and vote this November. 
Too bad this movie wasn't released in October.  But if pro-Moore and
pro-Bush supporters are registering and ready to vote this November because
of FAHRENHEIT 9/11, then THAT is where this movie has succeeded!
If you are an anti-Bush person, then you should see this film.   If you are a pro-Bush person, you should still see this movie.  The only
way to win an argument is to listen to what the opposing side has to say,
which most Bush supporters I know are not doing, that is why most of the
claims of their arguments aren't valid.  And even if you don't support Moore
of Bush, still see this movie.  If you don't agree with what Moore is
saying, then discuss and investigate his claims.  That way you are at least
informed with what is going on in our government and world.  Again, that is
where Moore and FAHRENHEIT succeed.  DON'T MISS THIS MOVIE!  ***** (out of
five)

Knowing Moore, there is definitely an agenda to his films.  He wants to show
how screwed up our country is by showing irony with humour.  In this case, 
he shows Bush and other principles in the most unflattering way - satellite
feeds before live broadcast, Ashcroft singing,  Bush muttering and goofing
off.  The story given has a fair amount of facts,  but disregards the
circumstances occasionally.  Based on the buzz coming from the critics and
other screenings,  there was the impression that there was devastating
footage that rivets you.  About half of this film does that,  but other
times it's talking heads and not entirely relevant anecdotes.  The endless
shots of Saudi dignitaries shaking hands of George H Bush and James Baker
are not "smoking gun" images.  Yes, the Saudies are quite different from us,
 but we generally do have a good relationship with them (remember, Osama Bin
Laden is against the Saudi ruling family as much as he is against the United
Sates.).  However,  the important aspects of what is soooo wrong with George W Bush is
covered well,  and indeed many other slimey aspects of his presidency are
left out.  In reality,  the film would have to be about 4 hours long in
order to go over everything bad about Bush.  As much as this film originally
was titled and created to expose the Bush-Bin Laden connection,  there is
actually very little about the other scandalous behaviour that was explored
in depth during the 9/11 commission hearings.  Instead,  it is the impact of
the war in Iraq that gains most of the film's attention.  Yes, one cannot
help but be moved when seeing amputees and grieving families.  It is these
scenes that are important for all Americans to see, since our Media refuses
to cover it. We must all be shaken awake to the fact that the Iraq war is
not a video game (as described by US soldiers in Iraq), but human lives
being destroyed.  For that, this film gets a 7 out of 10.

First a Personal Question:
I noticed that the amount of votes against this film were much too high for
a film not yet released. I'm curious how many people actually saw this film
prior to rating it since this is a very political hot potato.Personal question time is over.I just spent a Monday afternoon seeing the latest Michael Moore film with a
theater full of fellow movie goers. When it was over some of us were
applauding, most were very quiet.The film is not so much an attack on Bush as the asking of the question "why
are we really in Iraq?"Moore's answer is money. Whether you agree or not, you should see this movie
since it will show you a few things that may, or may not change your
mind.See the film before decide if its bad or not.Politics a side this is a movie that moved me and made me think. Its a good
movie as well as a good documentary since it makes you feel something, it
forces you to think and consider what is going on in the world. It should be
seen by as many people as possible, especially by anyone with a son or
daughter of draftable age.

The movie may be an attack on Bush, but I think there is a deeper meaning
there.  The entire issue of the 2000 election could have been handled if
PEOPLE DID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR GOVERNMENT.  A recurring theme in this movie is that the US government did things for its
own selfish reasons, or that they were manipulating the public somehow.  If
the government has truly become as manipulative as this movie portrays, it's
because we let it.I say this is not the time to blame our government, it's the time to work
with it.  Our country MUST serve the people.  The PEOPLE are the majority in
this country, not the government.  I hope everyone who sees this film is
inspired to learn how to contact their congressman, to register to vote, to
find out what they believe in.  If you can help accomplish this, Mr. Moore, you are my
hero.

Bowling for Columbine is one of the greatest documentaries of last
years.So I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11,the next Michael Moore's
documentary.Fahrenheit 9/11 is another great documentary from Moore.The
film shows us George W.Bush,from his controversial triumph to the
Irak's war motives.Moore shows Bush like a weak person and that he
can't be a country's president.The film shows,too,the relationship
between Bush family and Bin Laden family.There's one scene on the movie
that made me cry(it's strange that I cry watching a movie):the
interview to a woman who lost her son on Irak war.Fahrenheit 9/11 is a
great and powerful documentary that deserves to be seen

Canada, like the U.S., is owned not by the people, but by private
bankers and big business. I suspect that the lives of most of us peons
are worth nothing to our disgustingly wealthy owners except that we
might be so financially desperate as to go to war for them so we can
use the meager pay to feed our families. Michael Moore tells it like it
is. Only an administration gone mad with power would be BORROWING $1.64
BILLION a day (over $5 a day for every man, woman and child in the
U.S.) to finance a war to kill other human beings in a foreign country
while economic development at home, in cities like Flint, Michigan,
remains stagnant. But, war is 'good business', isn't it? It translates
to tons of revenue for the already disgustingly wealthy who finance
these wars.Civilization really hasn't progressed very far, has it?

Michael More, a living legend in provoking documentary have made a
enjoyable, remarkable film about George W. Bush's election, the war in
Iraq, the 9/11 disaster, The Taleban, The oil, The Saudi's influence in
USA's Politics and about love. Love to your own country, love to your
God, love to each and everyone. Because love seems to flooding out of
this man. His love for his own political ideas shines throughout the
entire movie. And even though this is meant to be the point (a critical
view on George W. Bush's wars) it's also the weakness of this movie. If
you don't care that other people make your opinions for you, and if you
don't care everything only got one side's view (Michael More's), then
this movie is the perfect suit for you. Even though the conspiracy
theories Michael More comes up with are some-kinda scary, his ironic
way to mention them sometimes make the whole movie laughable. I surely
hope that his intentions ISN'T to make people laugh, and thereby
selling more tickets/DVDs, but also I sure know better.Another weakness of this movie is the depth of it. Mr. More wants to
cover too many aspects of the government he fears so much, so many
aspects, that a lot of people will lose interest halfway through the
movie, and sometimes it's hard to find the red line.Except the above Fahrenheit 9/11 is enjoyable, but as a documentary it
sure lacks the subjective's point of view 7/10

Just saw this movie on TV, and was glued to the screen although it was
a horrible experience. horrible because the unbelievable corruption of
the Bush administration is sickening. Poor Americans, you guys have the
worst president you ever had, and he shouldn't have won in the first
place. Fox news is to blame? the people behind the curtains? so tragic.
this war is so tragic. this movie blew my mind. the best documentary i
ever saw. what a terrible experience it is to watch this movie from
start to finish. I cried so many times. it's a gut wrenching heart
breaking story, filmed and edited masterfully by the genius Michael
Moore, the most talented film maker ever to emerge from Flynt Michigan.
What a terrible world we live in, ruled by business interests and lies,
sick.

Unlike unpolitical Bowling for Columbine, this one is Moore attempt to
change the election and not get George Walker Bush his second term.
Good attempt to stop the new Hitler, however it come with price - it's
politically incorrect. Most of the facts was presented as the
Republicans and Bush themselves are the only one responsible persons
for it. But that is not true, the Democrats are in charge, Clinton
bombed the factory on Aspirin in Sudam. It was Clinton, who hit with
the tomahawks Afghanistan targets in hope to kill Osama bin Laden. And
since this hit is very likely the ignition, what light up the fire,
that caused 9/11 attack, the Democrats are responsible for it as well,
as the Republicans, that let the bad guys do it. Look, what power it
give them! To put it short, the whole USA overseas policy is up to
blame, not just Republicans. That make this one a mere voting
propaganda movie.

I just watched this movie (I know, took me long enough) and I was very
surprised at the large amount of one-sided information Mr. Moore gave
us. Now I've always known Moore to be bias in his films, but the
beginning of the movie was so filled with personal opinions that I
could not imagine a better way to invalidate the fine film the was to
follow then if Moore had mooned the audience. That being said I thought the film was pretty darn good! And at times,
very touching.But Ladies and Gentlemen this was as much a documentary as Friedrich
Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra was a Hallmark Card. And do to get
me started on the supposed 'truth behind Fahrenheit 9/11' flicks (i.e.
Celsius 411 and Faherhype 911)!! I mean honestly people, if Fahrenheit
9/11 was bias these folks take the cake.BTW if I hear another take off on a movie title that was a take off on
Ray Bradbury classic, I will hold the makes responsible for the
illiteracy rate in this country today :PNow getting back to my comment, if you can make it past the first
portion of the film then there is hope, for beyond the Bush Bashing
(and poor Al not getting support from the Senate) we have some of the
first candidate looks at America and the Middle East since this
'oil-wash' began. And for a 'documentary' it was quite a well produced
film, very deserving of the awards it won.So I would very much recommend this movie to anyone interested in what
is going on, but remember any one who takes only one person's
perspective at the truth is more dangerous then nuke in the hands of a
child. Look into this yourself please!"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that
matter." -MLK

I've never been a big fan of Michael Moore. The way he's marketed in
the UK is as a comedian of some sorts. So many critics claimed that his
latest film "Fahrenheit 9/11" is hilarious or seriously funny. It
isn't. It is a damning statement of fact, highlighting everything that
is wrong with the war in Iraq, the war on terror and the US
government's war on the rights of its citizens. I'm no fan of Moore but
I'm no fan of George W Bush either.The film opens with a reminder of Bush's dark days before 9/11, the
Presidential motorcade speeding through the streets of Washington, DC
to the chants and jeers of "Hail To The Thief". As soon as the 11th
September comes around, we all know what happened next. The Saudi royal
family (including members of Bin Laden's own family) were flown out of
the States while all other commercial airlines were suspended. The
Taliban were removed from power in Afghanistan and all trace of Osama
Bin Laden was lost. Then the Bush administration turned its guns to
Iraq, fooling the American people (as well as the United Nations) into
believing a non-existent link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. A
decision whose repercussions are still being felt today, both in terms
of lives lost and oil prices.For those of us who have never trusted Bush (myself included), this
film doesn't really reveal anything new. Anyone who has read Moore's
"Dude, Where's My Country?" or even Mark Crispin Miller's excellent
"The Bush Dyslexicon" (published before 9/11) will be aware of the
links between the Bush family and the Saudi royals, the remarkable
success of Dick Cheney's old company Halliburton since their former
CEO's rise to the position of Vice President of the United States and
the shadowy Carlisle group's dealing with various "rogue nations".
Sorry if all this sounds a little X-Filesque but the truth is that
these stories have been around for as long as the Bush administration.
All Moore has done here is bring all the loose threads together and
offer it on display for the masses. And for that, he deserves every
piece of praise he gets.However, despite the sheer weight of sordid detail, this film is hugely
unbalanced. There is very little counter-argument to Moore's point of
view and the film is loaded with provocative images such as the woman
from Flint, Michigan (Moore's hometown, remember) who grieves for her
dead son, killed while serving in the increasingly inaccurate War On
Terror. From a British viewpoint, there is also next to no mention of
Tony Blair's role in all this though that probably doesn't concern
Moore or his viewers. This is made for the American public and rightly
so. Despite Moore's insistence that it would alter the outcome of the
preceeding election, however, it turns out that it made next to no
difference at all and to be frank, it was naive to think that it would.
It's not like this is "An Inconvenient Truth" or anything else that
makes a significant impact on public thinking. Consider this a
historical footnote for the future but it's about as reliable as doing
research on Wikipedia.

This is the only movie I have ever watched that has literally caused me to

may yet be caught up in this mess of a war.  I pray that people who see this
will be motivated to do what's right for our country.See this movie! You may not like Michael Moore, but you will find some very
powerful arguments here.  Even my husband, who wanted very badly to hate

Everyone must see this film!. It is of the upmost importance before
Spiderman 2 before Hell Boy before anything see this movie. I have never
been touched by a documentary film as much as this before absolute
brilliance!. Michael Moore has show us the utter horror that both the George
W Bush and Tony Blair have put our troops and the people of Irag in and for
what?... WMD's? terrorists? hell no! oil and money!. This is a truly frightening film but also a very necassery
one.One major gripe was because of the american stand point the film was a
little one sided there was no mention of the British troops that were in
Iraq, but Fahrenheit 9/11 is one of the most enlightening films you will
ever see.Thankyou for all your brilliant work Michael Moore

This is a worth watching. Something you think you know but you don't.
Republicans try to ban the Ad of this movie.. that curious me to know
what is all about that gone so bad that American shouldn't see......
I'm not a democrat or republican but I am an open-minded person. I
encourage all Americans to see this movie (open yourself) and THINK
judge for yourself, open your mind - your ears - your eyes. Don't let
anyone tell you what is good for you. Explore your world. See all both
sides. For me, this movie is excellent. There are a lot of points to consider
from the start of the movie to the end. In 2000 Florida election, Bush
challenged media that he would win in Florida, from his own word "You
can write that down". .... How did he know that?Why there is no congressman want to send his/her own son to war? Why
rebuild Iraq? What if Iraq not an oil country do they still rebuild it?Think about it friends. Go see the movie.

Don't believe the lie, a lot of Texans don't like that that
"transplanted" Texan known as the "bushes". He did nothing as Gov. of
Texas and is abusing this country as they see fit. Every American should see this, because not one single fascist
conservative has the right the call this movie a "bunch of lies" which
is what they love to say when anyone says anything against the "king".Sad thing... many people will vote this moron into office again because
hes a "Christian" - in which I replied to the person who made the
comment "So is Kerry", hmmm that person didn't have a response for
that... perhaps her little brain could figure out the logic of her
reason to support a guy who can't say "terrorist" or "Terrorism"?
Somehow I doubt it.There is a lot of info missing in the movie, but its already a good
movie with what it has. But nothing is "lies", most of the movie is
footage and facts from govt themselves. Bush sticks his own foot in his
mouth, Moore doesn't put words into anyone elses.See this movie... to not do so, is un-American.Remember: Hitler controlled the media and the people of Germany
believed what they wanted to believe. To be faithful to a lie is only
foolish.But, there is a very good chance that Bush will steal the next election
since the "new" voting machines are manufactures by a company that is
"owned" but many high leveled republicans... such as Dick Cheney.Watch this movie... Its funny, its sad, its SERIOUS at the same time...
the people in the theater cheered when its over... but it won't mean
much if America continues to become some "other" country not based on
FREEDOM of Religion, expression and life.

Whether you agree with Bush's policy in Iraq and Post 9-11, one cannot
ignore the facts laid forth in this movie. Extremely powerful. I was
laughing one moment, crying the next. You owe it to yourself to see
this. Moore was able to provide evidence and information that the current
administration has done very hard to cover up. This film shows the
other side of Bush, the one that cares about the "haves and the have
mores." Even the most conservative GOP member cannot watch this film
without even questioning President's Bush and his motives. Again, go see this film. Preferably before the November Elections. It's
an eye opener

This film had a lot of information that was completely incohesive in
nature. It does not, in the least reflect any sort of real
interpretation since it does not look at the issues it represents from
both sides. It simply jumps on its own bandwagon and takes the viewer
for a ride of its own design with its own opinion on everything. It is
truly sad to me that so many people have been duped by someone like
Michael Moore who has spoken of Cuba as being the superior in health
care to America (Cuba being communist, of course) when Castro wasn't
even treated by the medical professionals he set up there. Michael is
always talking out of the side of his head and doesn't even live up to
the standards he so urgently impresses on others - like hiring
minorities and living simply.Where was he when Bill Clinton was being impeached by Congress for
committing perjury to the American people and falling asleep on watch
when Osama bin Laden was making early attacks during that
administration? Where are the biting words for liberals when they mess
up? That's a good question for Hollywood and the news media who like to
gloss over the mistakes of their political favorites. When will America (and the World) hear an unbiased and balanced telling
of events in America. Do liberals thing Americans so dumb, they cannot
think for themselves and must be led like sheep to the "correct"
thinking? This is a scary thought.

Slickly made- but one sided "mocudrama" focusing on the events after
the 9-11 tragedy.Moore-a fairly talented but ultra biased filmmaker
distorts the facts to fit his far left agenda. This is not a movie, or
even a documentary. It is a slickly made and packaged poster for the
Democrat party, which is NOT the same party it was in the days of FDR,
Truman or even JFK.Moore- Americas equivalent of Leni Reifensthall is
proof that anybody with a film crew nd camera can make anything to fit
their agenda. So if you MUST watch it- do it with an open mind-and take
it with more than a grain of salt. Wouldn't it be nice to see a
conservative filmmaker do a real documentary on the liberal media-and
exposing them for what they really are? Don't hold your breath.Zero

What can I say, I'm ashamed have been born in a country that eventually
sent troops to the US in aiding Bush wage his illegal war. To me the
movie presented nothing new (save for the fact bin Laden's relatives
were quickly smuggled out of the US) and frankly I pity the person who
somehow was in the dark about all the things the movie presents. Many
people have claimed Moore tries to lead the audience to a conclusion.
That thing may be true about 'Bowling for Columbine' but here he just
adds a note of humor to his presentation of facts, most of them can
easily be verified (others are harder to get to, but not impossible
with enough pressure). In fact Moore doesn't slam the neocons at all,
he allows the facts to do it by themselves, although the underlines and
idea here and there, for the American audience. Moore did a very good
job at poking the illegal occupation of Iraq and at the policy of
terror brought by the neocons against the American people. Hopefully it
will have some effect.

It's always funny to read the comments of the Bush fans on this movie
or anything Mr. Moore is doing. No wonder these people love a president
who's actively ignoring the truth and twisting the facts as much as
this one."If you are into hate, this is your movie" OK, so Mr. Bush, who started
a war without a reason (lying about connections between Saddam and
Osama, WMD and so on), is so much into love?? Also I find the comments
of the Michael Moore haters much more filled with loath than the peace
loving people's comments. But that's typical behaviors from these
people. Look at FOX, the "un-biased" media! It's always the other one's
fault! These people ignore the truth and their own state of mind. We
should feel sorry for them."Michael Moore makes his point: He doesn't like Mr. Bush as a person.
This is getting boring!" Let's see: About 98 % of the comments on Mr.
Moore's work refer not to his work, but to his weight: "He is fat and
dumb!" OK, so this is fair??"Michael Moore makes a lot of money" It's great how much these people
care about some million dollars this man makes, who obviously is not
interested (yet) in just being rich. There was even a site on his
homepage: "Spend Mike's tax cut for a good thing". And it's quite
disturbing that the same people don't care AT ALL about the HUNDREDS OF
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS of taxmoney being spent by their administration for
a war that was not necessary, for the benefit of Halliburton & Co, nice
move Mr. Cheney!"Michael Moore makes propaganda" This is my favourite. OK, so
everything Mr. Bush and his preachers on FOX news is telling is nothing
but the sweet and pure truth?? It's hard to imagine that anyone can be
ignorant and stupid enough to believe that! Most of the comments have
been written in 2004. Much more facts we do know today, how the
administration fixed the facts to fit THEIR propaganda. And remember
how George landed on that ship they had to turn around before so you
couldn't see in was in the harbour? The fake plastic turkey at the
first war Thanksgiving? You people make fools out of yourselves,
really.About the film: I found it a bit too long and complicated, and most of
the facts I read in "Stupid white men". But it was still great to watch
Mr. Bush, maybe the dumbest person ever to reign over a superpower.
Thank god America seems to be waking up now, when just 37 % of the
people support him.Thank you, Mr. Moore, for keeping on the good work!

Many people complain that they felt manipulated by the film. I do not
understand this idea. All filmmakers, artists, writers, or any other
creative folks, all of them do certain things to get their message
across. Michael Moore is no different. And please, someone show me a
documentary that really is completely objective! The US media certainly
doesn't count.Anyways, what we have here is a film made by a man extremely skilled at
toying with your emotions and outlining his case. This movie is an
argument, and, whether or not you end up agreeing with it, it is a
strong, well-put-forth one.

This film is, contrary to what many people say, very well done, and
pretty much all of the sources check out. The reason why many people
take such great offense to the film is that it expresses controversial
views. Many people claim that Moore has no "journalistic integrity." I
would then remind people that DOCUMENTARY IS NOT JOURNALISM.
Documentary does not, and has not ever, tried to be unbiased. Pretty
much the only ones that are unbiased are so because they are about
uncontroversial subject matter. I would urge people to give examples of
these supposed "unbiased documentaries" they have in mind - I would
wager they could not think of any.

Before I start, I will candidly admit that I am a fan of Michael Moore.  I
am strongly left-leaning, passionate about environmental issues and
increasingly anti-capitalist.  Not a huge fan of GW Bush's, then!  So this
movie/documentary was preaching to the utterly converted in my
case.However, I left the cinema feeling stupid.  My main emotional reaction,
other than tears at Lila Lipscomb's grief, was that I have not been nearly
angry enough over the last few years.  I agree with many of the comments made here, both for and against Moore. 
The movie is extremely manipulative and one-sided.   But then I can't think
of much in the media - any medium - that isn't.  All news has a point of
view, an editorial slant.  Every TV report has been cut in some way.  Every
TV show and movie is, however subtly or unconsciously, promoting a
lifestyle, or set of values.  However this 'documentary' is a drop in the
ocean, just trying to redress the balance a little.  You have minds of your own - if you don't believe what Moore tells you, look
into it, investigate, research, question.  That's the freedom we have - use
it or lose it!!I agree that the pictures of happy children playing in Iraq were largely
irrelevant, and the question of the persecution of the Kurds was not
addressed.  I can only guess that this was omitted as the issue was also
pretty much absent from all the spin and justification for the war.  That
was all about the WMD, Saddam's alleged contravention of UN directives. 
Regime change due to internal issues was not legally admissible as grounds
for war, however morally desirable it may have been.The sequence showing Bush and his associates shaking hands with a succession
of Arab men was pointless - I had no idea who any of them were.  Maybe they
were members of the bin Ladin family, maybe they were representatives of
international humanitarian organisations!  Presumably they weren't the
latter, but captions would have been helpful!The stereotyped images illustrating the members of the coalition made me
uncomfortable, and the omission of larger countries such as the UK and Spain
was significant.But these faults don't outweigh the majority of the film, which appeared to
me to be largely based on documented fact.  I take the point raised here
that much of what is 'revealed' is common knowledge, or common sense.  But
was it really?  While mindful of potential anti-US bias in some parts of the
UK press, I have read about the impact in mainstream US media of Bush's
declaration 'if you're not with us, you're against us'.  Supposedly, this
has been widely interpreted as meaning that any criticism of the Bush
administration will be perceived as anti-American.   This seems crazy to me,
as surely freedom of speech is absolutely central to the values cherished in
America.  I once heard patriotism described as similar to the love one has
for one's own family - even though you love them totally and instinctively,
you still recognise their faults, and even try to help them overcome
them.
My hope and belief is that the simple fact of this film is ensuring that
many issues are debated far more widely than before.  Ultimately, however, though feeling compelled to action, I am left with a
deep feeling of pessimism.  Over the last year or so, I have been thinking
'surely no-one is so money-motivated that they would utterly fabricate a
war'.  Surely there was some higher moral motivation?  After watching this
movie, I feel so naïve.  Yup - apparently money really does mean that much
to some people.

Bowling For Columbine was the highest grossing feature length
documentary ever made when it was released in 2002. Fahrenheit 9/11
made more money in its first weekend than Bowling For Columbine's
gross. Needless to say, the release was a massive media event, and
conservatives, particularly those in radio, are fighting to be the
first to denounce Michael Moore and anything he does or stands for. One
radio talk show host, Lee Hewitt, I think, even went so far as to call
Fahrenheit 9/11 something of a Rorschach test, 'Anybody who liked
anything about this movie clearly is an idiot' type of thing. It's
really sad to see how badly they want everyone to look the other way.
'This movie is propaganda/a pack of lies' (Limbaugh). 'This movie is a
test of your mental capacity' (Hewitt). 'The movie was SHOT badly'
(Michael Medvet). 'Michael Moore is a liar' (everyone). Some even
dubbed it astoundingly unentertaining and boring, an absolutely
impossible assertion regardless of your political standing. You know,
no matter how much you hate Michael Moore, it's hard to argue with
video evidence. And by the way, Mr. Medvet, that 'grainy' look was
there because you were looking at what is called stock footage.
Unproduced, unedited, uncleaned, unpolished. Best not to comment on the
technical aspects of a medium about which you clearly know virtually
nothing. That being said, I can understand a lot of the criticism that the movie
is receiving. There's a part in the movie, for example (this is
probably the part that receives the most glaring criticism) in which we
see a montage of Iraqi children jump-roping and singing and whatnot
before the war. When I saw that part, the first thing that popped into
my mind was, 'My God, why would Michael Moore arm his critics with such
a sequence?' Of course, the SECOND thought that popped into my mind
(note that there was more than one), was that this is a mixture of
Moore's quite often obnoxious sense of humor and his tendency to show
things that tend to get hidden, usually purposely.We know that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, that he ran an
oppressive regime, that he killed his own people, etc. What people
don't seem to get is that Moore is not saying that it was all singing
and dancing and sweet happy cheer in Iraq before Bush took us to war
there, but he was showing that those things did in fact exist in Iraq.
If you think that Michael Moore expects his audience to believe that
living under a dictator like Hussein resembled a trip to Disneyland,
see the Rorschach comment above. Disagree with them all you like, but
liberals are not drooling idiots, and Moore knows this. You look at the
news media, on TV and in the newspapers, even from the very mouth of
our own president, and you hear about absolutely NOTHING but killers
and evildoers and murderers and mass graves and weapons of mass
destruction and torture chambers and rape rooms, seemingly from people
who believe that Iraq in its entirety is a torture chamber. True,
Hussein ran a brutal regime, but that was simply what life was like for
Iraqis. They don't understand freedom after so many years of
oppression, and the notion that we could go over there and inject a
democratic government into a country that has lived in oppression for
so many decades and think that everyone is going to live happily ever
after loving America and Americans forever and ever is MUCH more of a
Rorschach test than whether or not you liked even a single thing about
Fahrenheit 9/11.Is it too much simply to show that there was some level of normalcy at
some levels in Iraq? And as far as being partly a result of Moore's
obnoxious sense of humor, I am referring to the sense of humor that led
him to hypothesize about what was going through Bush's head in the
first minutes after being told of the attacks, or that led Moore to
sneak up on Charlton Heston and unexpectedly ask for an apology for the
families of the Columbine victims for holding an NRA meeting in
Columbine shortly after the Columbine shootings. You could argue with
the idea that, based on the footage of Bush in that classroom after
being told about the attacks, he was clearly clueless about what to do.
There is even footage of him with his head down in that children's book
and his eyes are darting around the room as though he's afraid
someone's looking at him. His vacuous expression is indeed unsettling. But here is the thing that has to be kept in mind when analyzing this
movie from any political standpoint, THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. Michael
Moore himself has explained that Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a documentary,
but more of an editorial piece in which he presents HIS OPINION of a
variety of facts. Context is dangerously absent at many points in the
movie, but the important thing to realize is that it is entirely based
on FACTS. Michael Moore has considered offering a $10,000 reward (see
the July 12, 2004 issue of TIME magazine) to anyone who can
successfully disprove a single FACT (NOT opinion) in his movie. Given
that, Mr. Limbaugh, the assertion that the movie is 'a pack of lies' is
either propaganda in itself or pure, unfiltered idiocy. In Moore's defense, he shows a surprising and much appreciated amount
of restraint, playing only the audio over a black screen of the
September 11th attacks, sparing us from seeing the catastrophic images
that he knows we don't need to see yet again. He also largely
disappears from the movie himself, taking a sharp turn from his heavy
presence in his previous works, such as Roger & Me, the television show
'The Awful Truth,' and Bowling For Columbine, probably because he knows
he is taking on a much more touchy issue and had best let the facts
speak for themselves. Notice, for example, that as soon as he appears
in the movie, he can't resist walking up to various government
officials and asking them to enlist their own children in the war in
Iraq.Michael Moore is so determined in his opposition to Bush that he slips
up at times, but the larger picture presented by his movie is
impossible to ignore. We see a disturbing sequence which describes how
much more money the Bushes receive from powerful and wealthy Saudis
than from American taxpayers, and thus where their loyalties may lie,
although this is at odds with the Saudis opposition to the war in Iraq.
Even so, the embarrassing extent of Bush's verbal ineptitude is a
difficult thing to ignore, especially when we compare his delivery of
immensely intelligent speeches, clearly written by his teams of
speechwriters, and the disquieting spectacle of Bush Unplugged which,
as they say, is quite a thing to behold.If you hated the movie, fine. There's no reason that people should not
be allowed to disagree with Moore's film or his political views, or
even to simply not enjoy it (although opposite political views are
pretty much required for lack of at least some level of enjoyment). But
for crying out loud, don't make such outlandish and moronic claims as
that the movie doesn't inspire debate, is nothing but lies, or is pure
cinematic trash. I've heard all of these from people speaking into a
broadcasting microphone, and it's really disheartening to see how
closed-minded such people are. If you hated the movie, don't watch it
again, if you hate Michael Moore, don't watch it at all and just go out
and vote for Bush. That's how you get your revenge against Michael
Moore, vote for Bush because Moore wants nothing more than to get him
out of office. If, on the other hand, you are able to think for
yourself, watch the movie and take from it what you will. Believe what
you want, don't believe what you don't want, but don't blindly pretend
that Fahrenheit 9/11 is completely negligible just because of who made
it or because it presents a decidedly left-wing point of view. No
matter how you feel about it, there are some serious problems with the
American government pointed out in this movie to which everyone should
pay attention.

In a media press that is more sound byte than substantive, Michael
Moore continues his technique of uncovering the facts and data and
presenting them to a culture that is constantly subjected to "News
Lite" (All the stories - None of the facts). He is a brilliant writer
and director, weaving his information in an entertaining fashion that
makes the movie easy to enjoy. Yes, he does get heavy handed at times
with his message, but America is in such a lethargy from swallowing
media drivel that I, and probably Moore as well, think it OK to have
them hammered with the message. Life isn't about Reality TV. Reality is
a war that is taking American lives. If more people sit up and pay
attention to in depth coverage of current events, maybe we'll demand
more of our leaders in the future. I doubt it. So, in the end, it won't
matter what we all thought of this movie. Some will love it, some will
hate it. We'll not burn books to control the masses as did this movie's
namesake, Fahrenheit 451, but instead, we will watch films like
Moore's, go back to our Reality TV and roughly 60% of us won't even
vote in 2004.

Let me first say this: I hate Democrats and Republicans equally. My
political views most closely resemble a libertarian than anything else.
That said, I recently watched this movie two years after it was
released. In "Fahrenheit 9/11," Michael Moore does make you wonder
about a lot of the actions and policies of the Bush administration,
some of which I already wondered about, some of which was new
information. Part of the reason his approval rating is as low as it is
right now is because of a lot of what's in this movie, it's just now
starting to sink in. For that I applaud him. What I don't applaud him
for is not being able to edit the movie down. The movie was way too
long -- it could have been chopped down by about 45 minutes and still
had the same, or better, effect. Michael Moore seems to really enjoy
watching himself on film. Overall, though, I think everyone should see
this movie, regardless of political affiliation, and draw their own
conclusions.

Michael Moore did hit a raw nerve in his documentary about the Bush
Administrations handling of the 9/11 attacks,before and after, and it's
pushing for and getting almost complete US media support for it's war
in Iraq. Moore does this by showing just how the news media played a
vital role in it's support of Bush's lies and misstatements about the
Iraqi 9/11 connection. As well as that countries possession of WMD,
Weapons of Mass Destruction, that has led to the disastrous war in Iraq
that is costing America lives and money that could have been used
against the real guilty party in the 9/11 attacks: Osama Bin-Laden's
Al-Qeada terror organization. The US media has nothing to brag about in it's handling of the news in
regard to the "War on Terror". By giving Bush and his cronies in the
congress as well as in the media all the slack that they needed in
taking away a number of the American peoples rights in their phony war
in Iraq against those who he called the "Enemies of America". Who only
became "Enemies of America" after Bush attacked them.Smarting from all the evidence coming out of the 9/11 Commission as
well as Bush's "Man in Iraq" WMD expert David Kay as well as former top
WMD inspector of the UN Hans Blix and the US' own top WMD USMC Major
Scott Ritter on Iraq's non-possession of the deadly WMD. As well as the
9/11 Commissions total clean bill of health in regard to Saddam's Iraq
non-involvement with the Al-Qeada and the attacks on 9/11. The US media
is trying to distance itself from Bush's policies in Iraq but Moore's
movie "Fahrenheit 9/11" has thrown a monkey wrench into their plans. People by the millions in the USA as well as the world are seeing
through the movie just how the US media was cheer-leading the US and
coalition troops into the hell that Iraq has become for them. Now that
same media has to take responsibility for the lies and misinformation
that it spewed out over the last two and one half years. In pushing for
a war that has proved to be a disaster and totally unnecessary for the
American people. Unlike the war in Vietnam where almost all of the
media, as well as most of those in government now supporting the war in
Iraq, were against. This time as the war in Iraq gets bloodier and more illegal as more and
more Americans realize that they've been had into supporting it, by the
Bush Administration and US Media, what can the media say now to get the
trust of the American people back? They can't say, like politicians
like John Kerry and John Edwards, that they were fooled by Bush's lies
The media is supposed to be so much smarter and more intuitive and have
nothing to fear about not getting re-elected by the American people
that most politicians, like John Kerry and John Edwards, have to be
fearful of. And if, like John Kerry and John Edwards, voting to support
Bush in having the right to start a war in Iraq without a declaration
of war will get them re-elected, where at that time almost 80% of the
American people supported Bush, so be it. What the US media has done over the last two years in it's blind
support of the Bush policies in both "The War on Terror" and "The War
in Iraq" is de-legitimize itself. Yet at the same time legitimize
people like Michael Moore and the so-called radical news outlets,
mostly on the internet, to the American people as well as the people of
the world as the only true and honest news writers and news reports
available. Nobody well ever take the established media seriously again when it
bellows out in it's headlines about threats to Americas and the UK's
security. No one will believe media stories about war crimes committed
by world leaders like Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Solobdan Milosevic of
Serbia because of it's, like you would decide to or not to bet on a
horse at the racetrack, lousy past performances. In regard to Iraq and
that countries WMD and connections to the Al-Qeada Terror Network and
thus responsibility for the 9/11 attacks on America. I don't know if it was by accident or by design that Michael Moore
brought out this fact about the shameless record of the US media. In
regard to it's kowtowing to the Bush administration. The result of the
film Fahrenheit 9/11 will be far more devastating to the US media then
to Bush or any other leader who's supporting or has supported Bush in
his war in Iraq. GW Bush like all politicians will come and go but the media is with us
forever and has far more to lose by being exposed as a fraud and
incompetent fool then any President of the United States of America
ever will.

It takes a particularly hateful type of person to say anything good
about this movie. It's unbelievable how dishonest this film is, and how
the dishonesty always devolves toward hatred: hatred of Bush, hatred of
a paranoid vision of America, hatred for America itself, and more.
Honestly, this little hatefest of a movie has to be the most deplorable
propaganda film since Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will."Film students, especially those interested in documentaries, would do
well to study this for an in-depth look at how to use film editing and
insinuation to lie and lie and lie some more while rarely stating any
outright falsehoods. Clever editing and innuendo are all you need.This is a despicable film made by a despicable man.

It is truly disturbing, and indicative of what's happening in our
country today- especially the dominant liberal media, much of academia,
and of course the Hollywood elitists, that we see these glowing
accounts of such a sham of a movie. Innuedos, half-truths, things taken
out of context, viciousness, and outright falsehoods do not only not
make a good documentary- they are despicable and reprehensible. I don't
always agree with President Bush on everything, but I do mostly on the
war on terrorism, tax-cutting, and other things- and if you don't,
speak responsibly and respectfully, not like this slanderous film,
which will not come close to standing the test of time.

Before I saw this movie, I didn't know much about the war on terrorism
or on Iraq. This movie woke me up and had a particularly strong impact
on my beliefs in our government. Michael Moore is a smart guy, no
matter how fat he is, and proves his point well. I'd name it the best
documentary ever, and hope it changes people's views.Who can forget Lisa sobbing as she read the last letter her son sent
her before he crashed, or when she visits the White House and stands
there sobbing in front of it, letting out all her hatred?Who can forget George W. Bush stammering in all of his shots are
repeating things he just said, tagging him redundant? The most memorable part is when Moore confronts the congress members on
the street and asks them if they would be interested in enrolling their
children in the army. Of course, none of them do.This is the most powerful documentary in America and I give it a full
out 10 stars.

Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is a landmark film in American
cinema. It is a very detailed and well-crafted critique on the Bush
Administration from the day he was voted to be our next President to
the present day with the war in Iraq. Moore does not shy away from his
own opinion and presents it in a style that allows for the audience to
decide for themselves whether or not what he says is the truth. Indeed,
the film is completely biased but that doesn't matter because a lot of
what Moore says is actually true. He provides us with statistical facts
that may appear shocking to the average viewer but is considered to be
common knowledge for any full-hearted liberal democrat. This is a
serious drama that is told in a satirical way and I say that because
the film is actually pretty funny. Clearly, Moore seduces the audience
into believing that Bush and the rest of his cabinet are the stupidest
people in the world. I mean you see the Attorney General John Ashcroft
slick his hair back with his own saliva as he prepares to be
interviewed. We also see the stressful work environment of the
President of the United States as he takes a vacation to his Texas
ranch. These shots are meant to influence the audience into believing
that Bush has no idea what the hell he's doing and that he shouldn't
have been President in the first place. But in a way that's not funny
because America is run by a four-star idiot. Moore takes us on a
journey into Bush's political mindset since 9/11 and we realize that he
is so corrupted by the idea of supreme power that he loses focus on the
American people. Moore believes that Bush cares about his own interests
rather than the interests of the American people and has manipulated
the people into siding with whatever he does. This film is mainly a
propaganda picture for people who have no idea about the corruptive
nature of the Bush administration, from their business collaboration
with the Bin Laden family to the guarantee of economic profit for
Bush's defense company with the manufacturing of a war with Iraq. You
cannot be a liberal if you don't admire the vision of Michael Moore
with 'Fahrenheit 9/11'. But you also don't have to be a liberal and
stil admire this work of art. Moore doesn't simply focus on the severe
strain provided by the Bush administration but rather the feelings and
emotions of the American people. Moore's interview with the woman from
Flint, Michigan is both powerful and engaging and we realize that
soldiers are dying in Iraq for no good reason. That is the point of
Fahrenheit 9/11. This war is being fought for nothing and if we don't
do something about it, then America will fall in the end. If anything,
this film is patriotic in nature and encourages people to seek the
truth. Moore loves America and is a true patriot. But since the whole
country is ignorant of what Bush is doing, we are unable to see it.
Those who elected to keep Bush in the White House for the next four
years are ignorant of the truth. That is the real sad part of
'Fahrenheit 9/11'. Even though the film is biased, it it still poignant
and genuine and deserves consideration for Best Picture. Michael Moore
is a talented filmmaker and definitely does not fail with this film. Lenny's Grade: A

I was not a bit surprised by what Michael Moore shows in "Fahrenheit
9/11". Specifically, I had assumed since September 11, 2001, that this
was all true (although not until this documentary came out did I know
about Bush getting Osama bin Laden's relatives out of the country).Now, I know that the world's right-wing ideologues want to say that
none of what Moore shows has any relation to fact. Well, I have a few
questions for these right-wingers: can Rush Limbaugh deny that the
Saudis bailed Bush out when his business went bankrupt? Can Bill
O'Reilly deny that the Republicans would have practically burned
Clinton alive had he done any of what Bush has done since 9/11? Can
Sean Hannity deny that we STILL haven't caught Osama bin Laden almost
five years after the Twin Towers came crashing down? The fact remains
that Michael Moore always interviews the people who get affected the
most by these events, and does a hilarious job with it. The very fact
that the Bush administration never responded to anything shown in
"Fahrenheit 9/11" just shows that they can't because they know that
Moore would show them for what they are.All in all, this is the documentary that I recommend above all others.
It just might save democracy.

This is a must-see for every American.  Those denouncing the film, many of
whom 
haven't even seen it, are the same sad sacks who think that Fox News is
really "fair and 
balanced".  This is Moore's best film to date, and he went to great lengths
to assure that 
everything in the movie is factual.  If he told any lies in this movie,
trust me, the Wall 
Street Journal and the rest of the right wing media would be all over it.  I
don't agree 
with all of Moore's conclusions, but I do agree that George W. Bush is the
worst 
president this country has had since Richard Nixon.See this movie!  Those of us who have followed the news closely over the
last four years 
will not be surprised by the facts presented here, but most people (like my
brother) will 
be shocked to learn the extent of Bush's incompetence, corruption, and
hypocrisy.  We 
must vote this guy out of office in November.  If you aren't registered, do
so.  And vote 
November 2nd!  Take our country back!"Fahrenheit 9/11" will stand as a powerful document of this point in
history.  You don't 
have to agree with everything in it, but it does force you to confront the
harsh realities 
of war and politics.  For that I give it 10 out of 10****.

I guess I just wanted to add my two cents. It is early Tuesday morning
now, and I saw this film Friday night; the subject matter as well as
the construction of the film itself have had a profound effect on
everyone I know who has seen it, which is probably why I am committing
my thoughts to IMDb at 1 am.The film as a creature is a wickedly beautiful thing, and its blemishes
only render it more attractive. First, if anyone is dying to know, I
went into the film having ALWAYS been against the war in Iraq (from the
moment sometime in 2002 I found out it was already planned). Secondly,
continuing my confessional, my greatest fear from 9/11 on was always
along the lines of "what short-sighted and dangerous things are we
going to do in retaliation?"Still, a long time had passed since my most radical days (not as
radical as I once thought- and an even longer time since my most
conservative days), and I try to be reasonable and rational in how I
view things. Yes, I am a liberal. I view complicated things such as
international relations or rationale for war as complicated things, and
shy away from bumper-sticker politics (or religion for that matter).
While I have been derided in the past for the whole "it's complicated"
argument, I believe it is a necessity to understand complexity before
one can make a good decision. But decisions do need to be made,
sometimes before all the facts are in, and I respect a person who can
make an informed decision quickly and follow through with it.And this is what makes the timing of this film so potent- Moore is
trying to show that Bush was not as decisive as he has been portrayed
as, and that the decisions he made were very poor (at best). Moore has
hopes that in November his viewers accept his vision and reject Bush's
call to stay the course.Does the film achieve its goals? Only time will tell, but from what I
saw of the sold-out audiences in "Bush-country" SC (the GOP's words,
not mine), it might. IS IT FAIR in its methods? The question itself is
loaded, because as much as the right is trying to portray Moore as a
conceited, prankstering, America-bashing, rich 'liberal media' elite,
the administration really holds all of the cards (influencing
lawmaking, controlling the military, issuing executive orders,
controlling access, etc), and does a decent job of projecting the image
it wants to show. Fahrenheit 9/11 probably could justifiably be labeled as propaganda.
Even though most of the facts are true (I honestly can't say I know all
are), the film is engineered to show you one side of the story. The
truly brilliant aspect of the film is that it reminds the viewer that
what we are getting from The White House is also a show (down to the
spit-slicked hair), and equally one-sided. In other words, propaganda.
Any patriotic American should encourage poking holes in propaganda,
whether it originates from a film-maker from Flint, or our head of
state. One aside: (SPOILER?) In my mind, the most effective visual of the
entire film was the blacked-out screen which was paired with the audio
of the aircraft striking the WTC. Even though no image was projected, I
am sure everyone saw the exact same image in their mind's eye, for we
have all seen the same replays of 9/11 until they have permanently
burned into our retinas and collective memory. We all remember 9/11;
Moore wants to show us what he saw happen both before and after those
tragic events.While part of me wishes for the most straightforward documentary
possible on the matter at hand, another part of me realizes that dream
is impossible. An 'unbiased' film would not drum up as much interest as
this film has, and one could (I would) argue that a less biased film
would fail to raise the questions we need to discuss leading up to this
upcoming presidential election, which promises to be a referendum on
Bush's leadership.Go see it, and love it or hate it.

This movie is unbelievably good!!! Michael Moore succeeds in uncovering
the secrets politicians and the media are desperately trying to keep us
away from. He is showing how the United States Government basically
created a war just because they wanted to- they just decided that it
made all the sense in the world to trade Iraki lives for some oil. The
movie also showed the distance Americans have from the war and the
devastating effects that political decisions have on ordinary lives.
Moore also proved that it was possible to lie to half of the nation and
get away with it- and that in US politics you have to play dirty to get
votes. The most important asset of the movie is that it is showing
facts, but in a specially edited way so that one can really put the two
and two together! After I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 me and my whole family
got into a very emotional discussion- this movie is an excellent
summery of all the news we hear every day but don't bother to think
about. Michael Moore is a genius- everybody should see his
masterpiece!!!

After you watch this documentary and have doubts in their story or
interested on how others view about the movie, you probably go to
search engine, click here and there and read one of the most famous and
most cited critics again this movie in Wikipedia by Christopher
Hitchens (R.I.P) [1]I read his critic about the movie. Well, most of time I got lost by his
luxury words, but I try hard to understand what is he points.From what I can understand, I agree with his critics on movie, but his
view on Moore is more significant rather than the movie itself (you can
read it by yourself at the link to slate.com -- search it by yourself).In the end if article, Hitchens seems to imply that the situation in
middle east is better after than before. Are they? Do U.S.A really have
the right to invade every country that doesn't fit with their value of
"democracy"?Moore, with his documentary, contain a propaganda that wants people to
see that war or fighting is not the only solution to the problem. There
is nothing wrong to be pacifist you know that Hitchens?And I can't write a review.

/\/\/\/\/\. If this movie was a wave it would look like that. The movie
is a very frequent truth, lie, truth, lie with a sudden over elaborated
and exaggerated opinionated statement. Its better off if you just watch
the whole movie through while its muted. Now, I am not totally against
the movie. It does show some interesting points that I did take into
account. But most of them were scenes that were shown were Micheal
Moore was not talking. I believe that everyone is deceiving some way.
George Bush is a person with high power that puts fear and lies into
peoples face. (to Micheal Moore). But also, Micheal Moore is doing the
exact same thing, and with his already nice filmography behind him. He
already has a pretty high power as well. More than the average man. The
movie really needs to see that almost all presidents are pretty
corrupted in the United states and have all had their controversy. Some
worse than others, Some really bad at hiding it. But let this be known,
The more we blind people about sitting on the right side of the seesaw
while Micheal Moore tries to pull you to the left side of the seesaw.
The real solution of the problem is the middle of the seesaw. When the
person on the right side of the seesaw is on the ground the person on
the right side cant see the ground on the other side and vice-versa.
The only way too see both sides is to stay in the middle. You cant
expect change when you try to step in the same river twice. It wont
happen. Case in point, this movie is right, this movie is wrong. It
gets a 5/10 you are better off not watching it or watching it while
muted.

Michael Moore thrives as within the complexities of mixed interests,
contradictory opinions, strange facts, propaganda, complacency, blatant
lies (you will just believe it all as the liars look you straight in
the eyes and scare you to death with terror talk...), and much more
which still makes it hard to make sense of the scope of things that
just did not seem to add up with the Bush administration.Where Bowling for Columbine seemed so much more like genuine (albeit
biased) critique on American culture, with Fahrenheit it's hard to know
what to believe, as Michael Moore so clearly has a much more political
agenda. You feel the need to stay critical while taking up the
presented facts at the start of the film, then do some more digging
yourself later to fill the gaps and get a chance to put it together
yourself to form an opinion. This is what should be the strong side of
such a documentary and aided by Moore's comic style (for those who like
it) it starts fine.But what happens then? Suddenly halfway through, the movie becomes
something completely different and is suddenly all about the highly
emotional and subjective points of view of war widows and other
individuals who have suffered greatly due to Iraq. This is surely an
important story that needs to be told, but the sudden change in story
telling in the film just ends up making you aware of the film's
propaganda intentions, where the sentiments of these heartfelt stories
are used to drive the more cerebral arguments from the start of the
film home. Clever emotional manipulation? There are things worth watching in this film, but just beware. The
filmmaker did think he was smarter than you when making it, and that's
not right.

Fahrenheit 9/11, by Michael Moore, is yet another example of a
potentially talented artist taking the easy way out. There is no doubt
that MM has few peers in agitprop, but he has become a magnificent
filmmaker, as well. He understands how to truly manipulate an audience
without resorting to the cheese of a Steven Spielberg. Evidence of this
comes from the fact that the most bravura moment of his latest filmic
screed against President George W. Bush comes not from the humanzee
grins of our leader- especially in the 7 minutes of paralysis after
being told of the attacks, nor the oafish military recruiters he
follows about poor urban malls, nor even the distorted ethics of
exploiting a grieving mother whose son has died in Iraq or trying to
paint the Saddam-era Iraq as a place where carefree children flew kites
& all was well- despite over a million bodies in mass graves over the 3
decades of his American-backed rule, but by NOT showing us a replay of
the horrific fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11. He understands that the
viewers memory of the event will be far more powerful than seeing it,
again, for the umpteenth time. On the + side, the film is at its best
when it takes on its own- exposing the utter fallacy of the 'liberal
media' during the lead up to & during the war. Rather, Brokaw,
Jennings, & co. are shown as the sycophantic corporate daisy-chainers
they really are- not once calling the Bush Administration on its, now
proved, bevy of lies about the war. Of course, given the recent death &
apotheosis of über-moronic ex-President Ronald Reagan by the media,
it's a shame many need MM to state the obvious. Another highpoint is
the connection between the fact that it is Bush's American poor &
uneducated fighting the Arab world's poor & uneducated- a fact of wars
since their start.Instead of being a detailed journalistic 'true documentary' Fahrenheit
9/11 is a disorganized mess of a film, however occasionally brilliant,
that has only 1 unifying theme- a hatred for George W. Bush. As
admirable as this may be in real life, it does not suffice in reel
life. I suspect, though, that reel life is where MM prefers to reside,
for their he can solipsistically sneer at the American public he
repeatedly (& not wrongly, mind you) derides as being stupid, yet
Sisyphanly attempts to sway, even though few of those who should see
the film will, & those who do already agree with its tenets. A similar
phenomenon occurred earlier this year when it was the Conservatives'
turn to rail against what & who they hate with The Passion Of The
Christ. Sadly, despite all the wisdom MM wishes to impart to the
American people he fails to heed 1 of the oldest nostrums in the book:
choose your enemies well, because that's who you'll most likely
resemble. & from where I sit, that ain't pretty!

It's already been said. Michael Moore comes off as sentimental, and by
sentimental I mean to use it as it is defined by Wallace Stevens, who
said "Sentimentality is the failure of Feeling." Moore's interview with
the victims' family, the hushed voice, the soft gestures, all of it
feels done out of propriety more than active and intense empathy, it
feels as if he is cautionary when he talks to these people, and that
comes off as insincereSo the complaint is one about authenticity,
don't make a movie for the sake of a political agenda, make it for the
sake of a feeling or conviction which may very well be associated, even
causally, with a political agenda, but the political objective should
not have a large presence without the underlying, more personal
emotion/idea/conviction. The movie is well edited though, especially
the ending-- the rhythm and cadence of the very ending is so well done:
"For once, Mr. President, you're right."

Fahrenheit 9/11 opened the day I left on a summer trip - and I couldn't
see it in theaters. I finally got around to seeing it shortly after
it's DVD release and was surprised. What I found to be one of if not
the most interesting thing was the deleted footage of the Arab American
comedians dealing with 9/11. Moore's politics were not as evident and
we were allowed to observed. I kind-a wish Moore and put that in or
made a movie about them instead. Fahrenheit 9/11 is 'a movie of the
moment' - it will live on but not the way we imagine it too today. I
encourage you to go out rent the DVD and watch the extra footage, it's
the best part.

Just a quick comment: Michael tried hard to bring in many different
people to show that they didn't agree with Bush's approach and stance
on the war *against* Iraq. However, because a small sample of people in
the movie were used throughout, it does look like the opposition is
very small but fervent.I'd suggest that the opposition is much more widely held than was
suggested in the film. Otherwise, excellent film in a time when anyone
saying something against the government is branded as a traitor,
treasoner, etc. Loved the part about black Americans not being
supported in Congress concerning the vote count scandal that resulted
in Bush's victory over Gore.Can you say, "Keep the Power In the Family"?

Finally watched it last night, but it didn't show me anything more that
I knew already. Seeing it at least with the perspective of the campaign
and the 4 debates has only reinforced my own opinions of the facts
presented in F-911, as well as what has been released by the
independent and foreign press. What strikes me even today is the
unwillingness (inability) of working class Republicans (I was a Reagan
Republican, btw)to see that the facts are against the best interests of
the working class, and poor of America. Before I saw the movie I had
already come the the conclusion that the Bush economic strategies were
to create more unemployed and underemployed people to encourage
enlistment into the armed forces. This is the case in Iraq (50%
unemployment, hmmm... Flint was also about 50% also), with Halliburton
bringing in cheap labor from Indian, Pakistan, etc... and ignoring
probably the most educated and skilled workforce in the Middle East,
literally forcing them to enlist in the Iraqi Army out of desperation.
High unemployment/underemployment also decreases contribution to Social
Security, giving more ammo to privatize SS. Heath Care Savings Accts?
Give me break, can you save for even the cost for one nights stay in
the hospital? Or a Surgical Procedure? The bottom line is: when you
vote the Neo-Con (believe me, BushCo is no Republican) agenda, you're
voting against you're best interests as a working class individual,
that is, unless you're in the top 2% income bracket. Remember in the
movie, Bush's "Base" is the rich and powerful, "elites" he called them.
Most of us aren't his "base." Vote your best interests, vote while you
still can. If you don't vote your best interests, you may as well fill
out an enlistment form after you leave the polls on Nov 2. Me, I'm 44
w/no kids and I work for one of the largest HMOs in the country, either
way, I'll be fine 'cept for taxes. It's the rest of the us I'm worried
about.

I thought this film did a good job of summing up the vapid dumbness of
the Bush Administration, probably the worst executive branch cast of
characters in the history of the United States. It's subjective,
one-sided ... but hey, at least it's honest and up-front about where it
stands.However, I thought a few things were a bit silly: First of all, the
finger is always being pointed at the Saudis, and -- it would seem from
the visual language in the film -- at Arabs in general. And okay --
Bush is an oil guy from an oil family, and the Saudis have a lot of oil
and influence with the Bushies -- we all understand that. But watching
this film, you get the impression that the Saudis were also somehow
connected with the invasion of Iraq, etc. When in fact, the Saudi
government came out in opposition to the war, whatever private feelings
might have been there at the time.Furthermore, there is absolutely no mention of Israel in this film,
which is weird, considering that the people in the Bush administration
who planned this war in Iraq since the 1990s were very upfront in their
writings on the subject that it was a project designed to "reshape the
security environment" for Israel. And Israel trained US forces,
provided intelligence support, and received lucrative oil contracts
(yes! Israeli oil companies supplied product to US forces in Iraq, a
country that actuall *has* oil of its own...) connected with the Iraq
invasion. But no mention of Israeli influence on the planning of the
Iraq invasion. It was all the Saudis and the oil connection. Hmmm. I don't suppose the fact that this film was produced by two very
strongly pro-Israel guys has anything to do with the omissions in this
film? We're left to wonder.

Parts of this movie were amazingly moving -- especially the entire Iraq
sequence, including Lila, the mom who had lost her son and the scenes
showing the destruction and civilian casualties. Some scenes (such as
the public execution) were not really necessary and too gruesome for my
taste. The scenes of burned and injured children and a dead baby were
also gruesome and unpleasant. But I guess if we caused it, we ought to
be willing to look at it! Parts dealing with the Bush - Saudi
connections seemed to drag on too long and weren't particularly
convincing. Overall, an excellent movie, though. (About as fair and
balanced as Fox News, but still; it does present a view point.) The
final scene (Bush's fool me once quip) was TOO hilarious!We watched it over and over and even my Republican husband was rolling!

What I did like about this film: It does provide insights to issues
surrounding our war with Iraq as well as what took place before 9/11.
Although some of the facts presented may not be accurate, most of it
is. So the general audience should distinguish the facts from Michael
Moore's opinions and draw his/her own conclusions. I don't know if
there is any truth to the connections between President Bush and the
Carlisle Group associates during the war or between Bush's financial
interest and the Iraqi War as Moore suggested. But I do find myself
agreeing with him most of the time especially since his explanation to
our war with Iraq seems to be the only logical explanation brought up
thus far. Just a reminder, no weapons of mass destruction or any traces
of them were ever found. On top of that, no link between Sadam and al
Qaeda was ever established (read The Washington Post, CNN, and BBC News
reports about this). I have questioned Bush's decision to invade Iraq
for the past year. If there is any legit reason for this war, Bush and
his administration will be the first to find it. But his failure of
doing so even to this day further convinced me that either there isn't
any legit reason, or that he was completely fooled by false information
(hard to decide which is the better justification). Enough about my
political convictions, the point I'm trying to make is that I like the
fact that this movie may have brought doubts to the minds of some
people that are blindly following our president who have proved little
during the past three and a half years. Lastly, I was deeply moved by
the interview with Lila who had lost a son in the war (Army Sgt.
Michael F. Pedersen). She was patriotic and quite strong emotionally,
and my condolences go out to her family.What I didn't like about this film: Moore claims Fahrenheit 9/11 to be
a documentary, but it's not because of its strong bias, and he does
seem to preach at times. Aside from this, a few parts of the movie were
a bit of a drag. For example, I think he overemphasized Bush's lack of
business success early on since this doesn't support much of anything
else.One other comment: Some user (I forgot who it was) criticized Moore's
spontaneous interview of the members of Congress because it put people
on the spot, and so of course they said some stupid things. My response
to that is if you pre-arrange an interview with a politician, you will
simply hear out of their mouths what you wanted to hear. Heck! They'll
even compose and recite a speech for you if you'd like, and you'll
never know what are really on their minds.So this is just my thoughts, "thank you. Now watch this drive"

This movie was a mind-altering control factor in its purest form.
Whether or not it did it in a good way is debatable. I think Mr. Moore
does make a lot of excellent points and it goes without saying that by
no means is George W. any sort of president. However any good
documentary reveals both sides to a story which this did not. It was so
one-sided it was ridiculous as if to say that there is only Michael
Moore's side. He should be the last one talking too, he travels
everywhere by limousine, he lives in a multi-million dollar complex
(just read his biography on this site), and it's not like he's the
nicest guy in the world in real life either. In fact when he's not on
camera he can be a real prick to put it nicely. So while a lot of good
arguments were brought up, I'd strongly caution the viewer to not take
everything as gospel because Michael is trying just as hard to control
people as are the current people in office. What is the right answer?
Well I'm not positive, but I think it lies somewhere in the middle.The one issue I did completely agree on is that corporate America is
destroying this country, their endless pursuit of greed and to line
their own pockets will eventually lead to our downfall, but how long
from now? I honestly don't know.Final Point:Theaters: You could, but I'm glad it's one I waited for on rental.DVD Purchase: No, because in a few years it could be obsolete.Rental: Yes, this way if you miss a message trying to be conveyed you
can just go right back to it.

I have grown cynical about the concept of democracy; it's a great idea
in theory but has never quite been realized.And who would want Bush's idea of democracy anyway? Freedom for the
"haves and have-mores" and a dictatorship for everyone else. A
government run by thieves and headed by a dry-alcoholic idiot-boy.But what can anyone do? Isn't it the way of the world that power
corrupts? The most recent example of this being Tony Blair: in 1997
dear old Tone, "the people's prince", was all promises and ideals;
then, seven years down the line, his ambition and greed have sent him
into the arms of gurus, sycophants and George W. This film, however, has lifted me out of my apathy and made me angry.
Yes, Moore's film is biased and emotional; however, the subject matter
cannot help but stir strong emotions and sway law-abiding and
honourable people against the profiteering and corrupt Bush government. Whilst the 'war on terrorism' acts as a smokescreen for Bush's
nefarious acts, 'Fahrenheit 9/11' inspires a people's 'war on greed'
with the only weapon our vote - if indeed it is counted - to ensure
that neither Bush nor Blair is returned to power.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is full of contradictions and quite blatant attempts to
mislead the viewer, and yet its message seems on track for many people
in Europe watching the downfall of America under President Bush. We
share Moore's loathing of Bush and welcome the detailed scrutiny of his
actions and highly suspect motives. Much of what he says appears, on
closer analysis, to be true. On the other hand, his exclusion of the UK
from the list of nations supporting Bush in Iraq is bizarre in the
extreme. I also dislike his emphasis on patriotism. Why is it a good
thing? why must Americans go around waving flags? It's not necessarily
a good thing. Indeed in European history intense nationalism and
obsession with military power have led to catastrophe on several
occasions. Might it not be said that America is heading in the same
direction? Here Moore has to be populist in order to appeal to
Americans whose brains have been weakened by constant patriotic
proganda, but it would be good if Moore could stand back from this a
bit. I was impressed by the film and have thought about it more than
most other films I've seen this year. What a pity it won't achieve one
of its stated goals of unseating the autocrat in the White House.

This is a really good movie which I rate 8: I am pleased how much a
documentary can be so well directed and edited. I preferred a bit more
'Bowling for Colombine' but Fahrenheit is almost as good.
My rating would raise to 10 if I look at the contents of the movie: it is
undoubtley biased against Bush and republican (90% of american media are
biased *in favor* of Bush, tough ...), still, if just %50 of what Moore
shows id the naked thruth, it would be a shame if Bush get re-elected ...
and a strong evidence how much our civilitian is flawed to allow such things...
I am not against americans, I have many good friends from US which always
surprise me for their education and taste (which of course does not vote for
republicans) I am against people who support Bush-like attitude, which,
unfortunately, happens world wide ....All the best to the US nation - and God help us if Bush will succeed again...

Moore makes clear that power is relative.  And that Bush and his buddies
overestimate the power of the USA.  Like Churchill said: "you can trust the
Americans to do the right thing, after they have tried every other
alternative".  Bush seems to do everything wrong.  I hope he does the right
thing: loose the elections.  And I'm no fan of Kerry...  I'm just no fan of
the American way.Mind you, I am a big fan of democracy, freedom, capitalism.  Moore is
excellently expressing his freedom of speech and his freedom of opinion. 
This movie shows a lot of problems of the American society and of American
politicians: poverty, lack of commitment, lack of understanding of the
anti-American emotions in the rest of the world, and too much trust in the
power of the military.  I just read that 45 milion people in the USA are
homeless.  That's 1 out of every 6 people in the USA!

Dear defenders of democracy,In my view, the Bush-Administration will stop at nothing to win the
upcoming election.The United States may soon be facing their worst crisis in Modern
History if both Democrats and Republicans (moderates,
Constitutionalists) don't stand up for themselves and prevent the
Bush-Administration from winning (stealing ?) a second term.I'm sure many of you have already heard about "Black Box Voting",
Diebold etc. I'm afraid the erosion of democracy in the United States
started in 2000 and is continuing at warp speed.As a European, I'm baffled by the reporting of the US-media. A few
exceptions not included, they have failed and are still failing to
bring the facts about the Bush-Administration to the American public.
The media in the US are either cowards or endorse the GOP. This is
especially apparent as far as nationwide TV-channels go. In 2000 the
Bush-camp called CNN "liberals". Very funny indeed. How many outspoken
Republicans do we know at CNN ? Larry King, Bob Novak, Bill Schneider
etc. The list just goes on and on ... And Fox, well, we all know where
they stand. NBC is owned by GE; CNBC is overtly Republican ... Need I
go on ?Michael Moore may manipulate or exaggerate (re-arrange) certain
developments, but isn't that the purpose and nature of film ? He makes
people think for themselves and discuss what's going on in this world.
The facts in his documentary are undisputed. Yesterday, some new
material released by European media (interviews with American
independent investigators, ex-CIA-people etc.) confirms the following :
Osama Bin Laden's brother, who is in charge of the financial structure
of Al Qaeda and the Bin Laden Group, was allowed to leave the US by
plane on 13 September 2001.Mind you, previous Administrations, including Clinton's, were afraid to
interfere with the powerful Saudi's because of the consequences a
conflict with OPEC might have. But the Bush-clan had already been
sleeping with the enemy (the Bin-Ladens) for years. So their trying to
cover up the facts and to minimalize the extent of their relationship
with the Saudi's only seems logical. People, just imagine what a
popular Islamic Revolution in Saudi-Arabia might provoke ? Oil prices
hitting, say 150 dollars a barrel ? THIS SITUATION NEEDS TO BE DEFUSED
IMMEDIATELY AND IT WON'T BE EASY.One thing I know is this : if W and his cronies are allowed a second
term, they risk bringing the world on the brink of a crisis of gigantic
proportions.The Bush Maffia have spit on the graves of the Founding Fathers and on
the Constitution of the United States (Patriot Act etc.) As we speak,
they are plotting an election fraud that will dwarf what happened in
2000. Companies like Diebold (electronic voting machines) have already
pledged to "deliver" certain States.A message to ALL Americans : inform yourselves, stand up for your
rights, unless you want to see your worst nightmares come true after
November 2004. Europe and the entire world are counting on you. I love America(ns);I just hate to see what Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld-Ashcroft-Wolfowitz are
doing to your great Nation. Restore the land of the BRAVE and the FREE. From Europe with love.

From a UK perspective, Moore's tabloid, scattergun approach is not perhaps
how we'd go about the business of exposing George Bush. Many have criticised
this film as a mess, with some justification. At one moment, he lacks all
subtlety and it is as if he has handed a sequence over to one of his teenage
fans (the "coalition" sequence, with its monkeys and spliffs); at another he
is very subtle (Ms Lipscomb, in her pain at the loss of her son, uttering
the very same words as a similarly bereaved Iraqi mother - except that you
wonder if Moore actually noticed that, and if he had, would he not have
picked up on it and brandished it in our faces as he does other
connections?)The effect is dreadfully uneven. Why, you want to ask, did Moore not examine
the unwillingness of any senator to endorse the complaints raised about the
Florida election in that otherwise excellent sequence near the beginning of
the film? Why did he not anticipate the obvious counter-polemic from his
opponents and refer even once to the fact that Saddam's regime was,
actually, pretty horrendous?It was obvious from the start that legal restrictions, starting at a trivial
level, would dictate much of what we saw ("that Taxi Driver guy" indeed!
Affleck's people give name-check permission: Pacino's obviously do not!).
One wonders how much of rather greater significance had to be pulled. Not,
presumably, the brand of T-shirt proudly worn by the Oregon lawman (does
Moore really need product placement?). Nor the Mickey Mouse logo tellingly
worn by another character, surely being lampooned. Or not. Hard to
tell.I am glad this film was made and released. John Berger, in today's paper,
believes that, uniquely for a work of art, it may ensure George W fails to
get re-elected. But America is such a strange and frightening country that
the opposite may equally well be true.

In case your confused about documentaries please let me inform viewers that
all documentary filmmakers have some sort of agenda. That's why their making
a film! Why would someone go to all the trouble and money and time to make
something that they don't feel a passion for? They wouldn't and Michael
Moore in his own way (Like it or not) has again made a pretty entertaining
film. I'm the first to admit that this is a flawed documentary but Moore's
doggedness makes any subject that he's covering compelling to watch. There
are several moments in the film that are very strong even if you disagree
with Moore's politics and his approach and the first one is the footage of
the Republican controlled Senate. The images of what American soldiers are
doing in Iraq is both heartfelt and disturbing and Moore does show the
Military in both an heroic sense and at it's most repulsive.One of the best moments is the way the film follows Lila Lipscomb who at
first is a staunch supporter of the military and then the ultimate horror of
losing her son in Iraq in which we witness her turn around. Arguably the
most infamous scene shows President Bush not reacting when told the country
is under attack and it's a priceless scene that is worth the price of
admission. Moore does his best to show President Bush as a clueless bumpkin
and someone with economic ties with the Bin Laden family but these are
issues that we knew already so Moore does tread on territory that is overly
familiar. I also thought that the scenes where Moore's narration starts to
pontificate on what a certain person might be thinking is also a big flaw
that does nothing but open the doors for cheap jokes. To Moore's tribute
this film did make me think about this countries involvement in the Iraqi
War and I would be surprised if everyone else who views this film didn't
also do the same thing. That would be Moore at his best and his poignant
agenda is the crucial reason as to why I'm recommending this film.

FAHRENHEIT 911 (3 outta 5 stars)Even though I am in complete agreement with Michael Moore's political agenda
I am becoming more and more disenchanted with his heavy-handed approach as
time goes by.  (Good lord... can't this man make even ONE movie without
bringing up Flint, Michigan?)  So I can definitely see why viewers not in
tune with Mr. Moore's wavelength would dismiss this film as nothing but
left-wing propaganda.  Propaganda it may be... but probably as close to the
truth as anything the right-wing propaganda machine (led by the power elite
in the White House) has been spinning for the last 4 years.  Sure, this film
and its depiction of events from the "election" of George W to the present
day is biased... so what?  Show me an entirely un-biased documentary and
I'll show you a snooze-fest.  Love him or hate him... but this film will
definitely give you something to think about.  I found the first half of the
film (and its constant, repetitive Bush-bashing) a little slow-going... but
the latter half... dealing more directly with the war and its victims... has
some very powerful moments, undercut a bit by Moore's penchant for overkill.
(Don't show a weeping mother breaking down once when you can show her
breaking down TWICE!)  Kudos to Michael Moore for fighting the good fight...
but I think he'd be more effective by dialing it down a notch or
two.

Actually, I'm a bit disappointed. Maybe it is because as a European,
most facts he presents were already known. Or maybe it is because he
uses the same propaganda methods he rightly accuses Bush of.... Or
maybe is that Tarantino's praise about the filmic quality had give me
high expectations..still, the basic point, the lies about the iraq war and status of the
bush clan, he tries to make is right, and hopefully some Americans who
normally watch a biased network like fox, now see the other point of
view. It is pure propaganda, so the word documentary might not be
chosen correctly

The film clearly points out a couple of fundamental problems with the
political climate in the US of A. It also gives a perfect illustration
of what war really is. It contains a number of very strong parts that
just need to be seen by anybody who believes him/herself to be
"politically engaged". It's a good film.However I don't think it is a good "documentary" in that sense. Perhaps
my European background is preventing me from being objective about
this. I believe a good documentary first "investigates" a subject and
lets the viewer observe the issue from different perspectives. Then at
the end the viewer can make up his/her own mind/conclusions about
things and perhaps the documentary can do so as well. With this film it
is the other way around: Mr. Moore starts out by making a
statement/conclusion and then uses examples and illustrations to prove
his point. Now most of the arguments he presents are (I think)
obviously current, still I don't like this "method of discussion".
Perhaps it's an American thing? It seems a little bit "over the top" to
me.I gave the film a 9 though.

First, let me begin by saying I've been voting Democrat since I could
vote. Now, for those of you still reading, I'd like to continue by
saying this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Honestly, it's irrelevant how many creative edits there are or
misleading comments taken out of context. The facts are that there is a
financial connection between the Bushes and the Saudi Royal Family --
and that 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi and none were from
Iraq. Bush threw away a world of goodwill to wage a war against a
nation that was not only a non-threat to us, but it was barely a threat
to those nations it borders.It's also as plain as Moore's double chin that Bush and his neo-con
chickenhawks are waging a war against this country's poor and
middle-class.And thanks to our asleep-at-the-teleprompter mass media, they're
winning that war, as well. Looking forward to your next movie, Mr. Moore...that is, while we still
have a First Amendment in our Constitution.

The big problem with this movie is that it´s just not going to help the
world, or the US citizens, for that matter. If it would become necessary
watching material for high school diplomas or college degrees, it might make
a difference, but not as a "choice movie", because the people who already
hate "president" Bush will love the movie, but his supporters aren´t even
going to watch it. Nonetheless, the latter will defame it and its creator
(and rate it with a "1" on the IMDB, without watching it, of course, to
bring the average vote down).This is a propaganda movie against George Walker Bush, no more no less. It´s
been said before that it´s not really a documentary, but rather op.-ed., and
I agree. The big thing about it is that it´s merely a COLLECTION. Anybody
could google the internet for an hour and find out everything the movie
claims. And the information has been available for months and years. What´s
sickening really is that it takes an overweight biased American to bring it
all together and into the cinema, in order to get Americans (who should
normally take steps to control and oversee the work of their own government
THEMSELVES) to look at all these facts.As I claimed above, the Bush supporters are probably not going to watch this
movie in a cinema. And Bush himself neither. That´s what separates him from
Adolf Hitler, for instance, who desperately wanted to watch Chaplin´s "The
Great Dictator" - after banning it in Germany, of course.
I don´t like Mike Moore that much anymore, he´s just TOO biased on every
issue he touches, and he can´t take any criticism, but he´s important. At
least one American stands up for his country and its true values, and does
not follow the leader like a lemming.The movie itself is pretty hard to swallow most of the time; especially the
scenes shot in Iraq. There are some lengthy scenes in it; the camera just
stays on the weeping mothers a little too long. But I realize it´s important
to see ALL the pain and anguish in these human beings, because it´s simply
not shown in the usual US media. The facts come way too fast and confused,
but you get the general sense of every issue touched in the movie. Overall,
a very good and important work.

Criticizing the President isn't new. Nor it taking cheap shots at him.
Satire is built upon the idea of making light of the institution while
making a political point.And "Fahrenheit 9/11" certainly does that with a gusto. It's biting,
sometimes witty and often powerful, but does it deserve the praise it
has received? Is Micheal Moore some sort of champion of freedom, or an
ego driven madman? The truth is probably somewhere in between.The film is done in the style of an investigative journalism piece.
Moore, upset about how Bush has been conducting Presidential affairs
since taking office, looks into the events leading up to September 11
as well as the aftermath, and makes some startling conclusions.According to Moore, Bush dropped the ball prior to September 11 and
then quickly used the event as an excuse to rally patriotism into a war
cry not only against Afghanistan, the country giving safe harbor to
terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, but also Iraq, whom Moore sees as
innocent of the whole ordeal.During his investigation he chronicles the history of Bush's business
partners and theorizes a conspiracy involving the Carlyle Group, an
international business partnership that includes, along with both
Bushes, several Saudi oil barons and other supposedly dubious
investors, including members of the bin Ladin family. He also
interviews a Flint resident named Lila Lipscomb, who undergoes a
transformation from military supporter to anti-war activist after her
son is killed in combat in Iraq.In terms of quality of a film, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a vast improvement
over Moore's last piece, "Bowling for Columbine." Here Moore is more
calm, more composed and his target is a little more well defined, but
it seems with the new film Moore's problem is his sin of omission.There is no denying what is on film, but is it the whole truth? It
certainly is thought provoking, and Bush is clearly shown in this film
as an ineffectual leader who perhaps depends too much on other's
advise. One memorable scene has footage of Bush sitting in the Florida
classroom and reading the children's book "My Pet Goat" after being
told about the World Trade Center attacks, almost unsure of what to do
next.But there is just too much circumstantial evidence and fooling around
with the narrative for the movie to be a serious piece. What's more,
like in previous Moore documentaries, it seems he can't be satisfied
with the material he has, but has to mess with the storyline to make it
overly dramatic. The footage with Lipscomb is powerful enough as it is,
but the way Moore presents it, it seems like he was documenting a
family from the very beginning only to have them suffer tragedy, when
reality is quite different.In an interview in Entertainment Weekly, Moore admitted that all the
footage involving Lipscomb was shot after her son's death. It doesn't
change the power of her arguments, but it does change the meaning of
the segment."Fahrenheit 9/11" also points out that Bush allowed for members of the
bin Laden family to leave the country following the September 11
attacks, and uses Richard Clarke as the most damning voice against
this, though he neglects to mention that Clarke was the one who
personally okayed the departures. Moore makes mention of a pre-existing
plan to invade Iraq prior to the war on terror, but neglects to mention
it was created in 1998, under Bill Clinton's administration.Certain scenes in the movie are powerful but also seem out of place.
One interesting segment shows Al Gore, acting as President of the
Senate on his final day of office, being forced to repeatedly silence
the congressmen speaking in his favor because of rules violations.One funny scene has Moore trying to get Congressmen to have their
children enlist in the military and fight in Iraq after an earlier
scene had Marine recruiters hunting down lower income people in Flint,
Michigan. The looks on the politicians faces are priceless, and speak
quite loudly -- the children of powerful people don't have to risk
their lives.And that's perhaps the movie's largest faux pas. Moore is so vehemently
opposed to a second term of office for Bush that he will put just about
anything on screen to discredit him. If you want to see Bush bashed
beyond recognition, and believe me, he does plenty of damage to his own
reputation without Moore's help, then this is certainly the movie for
you.But it's also a propaganda piece, and one that's presented as a
documentary. And that's the biggest thing going against the movie. If
this was a "movie," it wouldn't be as bad since we expect distortions
in storytelling. But documentaries, for whatever reason, must be held
to a higher standard, because by their very nature they're meant to
show reality.I can watch "Woodstock" knowing I'm seeing a true presentation of the
what's occurring on screen, but I can't say the same about anything
Moore creates. His films are certainly fun films to watch and provide
food for thought, but Moore has become too big a figure in politics for
his message of the little guy to ring true anymore. Furthermore, in
Moore's world there's no room for dissenting opinion. That's a world I
don't want to live in.6 out of 10 stars. It contains undeniably powerful imagery and human
emotion, but it's way too biased to be a true documentary.

I didn't feel or leave the theater angry after viewing this movie.
Instead I was sad, disappointed and yes, a little guilty.Every issue has and should have opposing sides and views. This movie
was one. The media, politicians, you and I have ours.Fact or fiction? People are being killed - fact. What interests me is
whether each death (man, woman, child) is justifiable, necessary? The entire human race not parts of a world community need to feel we
are and will be better off from our actions or inactions.Whereas before my opinions were only discussed with those around me. I will have my say. I'm going to vote.Even after viewing this movie, I would not be surprised if all current
leaders are re-elected. Ignorance is nothing to feel guilty about.
Complacency, is.

Even if The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences fails to
recognize Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9/11 with a nomination for Best
Feature Length Documentary its place in film history is secure. This
incendiary and powerful film is an unforgettable viewing experience and
not only because it's a deliberate, muckraking attempt to besmirch the
current president and his administration. Moore also takes aim at The
Media in general, castigating The Powers That Be (NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN
etc.) for a reckless mendacity that led to a televised War where TV
Anchors and journalists joined the ride to Baghdad and reported and
photographed only what Bush & Co. wanted the American people to see and
hear.In BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE (2002) Moore targeted The NRA as the Big
Villain in allowing laxity in gun laws for creating the horrendous
murders and maiming at Columbine High School in April of 1999. The film
was a disturbing but often unintentionally hilarious expose of the
state of mind of many Americans whose lives are controlled by fear and
the need for firearms as weapons of defense. It was America turning the
Gun on Itself, in stark contrast to its relatively placid neighbor to
the north, Canada, where firearms are prevalent but murders by shooting
are significantly lower than those in The States.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 employs the same canny juxtaposition of images that
made the earlier film such a deliciously barbed and caustic social
commentary. Although Moore's main target is one George W. Bush, other
big players in his administration are vulnerable targets as well. There
is also open season on Democrats and The Media in particular. perhaps
the most chilling aspect of this movie.Whatever the outcome of the election in November, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 will
be remembered for its unstinting bravery in stripping the layers of
deceit that have plagued this country for the past four years. As with
BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, it is a movie that will make you laugh, then
make you cry, and ultimately make you angry. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 has an
immediacy and importance that makes it the film of the year, and a
clarion call to this generation and the next.

Michael Moore may the wild-card that tips this election. His
documentary is sending people to the theaters to see for themselves
what all the gossip is about. This movie did a wonderful job in showing
why we should not be in Iraq. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact
that we cannot impose democracy upon a people. Most of the Arab world
(over 90%) was strongly opposed to the war. Everyday in the news, we
hear of car-bombings, kidnappings, etc., all by Iraqi insurgents who
are opposed to a US presence in their country. How much longer will
this continue? There were some powerful emotional moments in this movie. I was shocked
at the scene where none of the black representatives in Congress could
get the approval of a single senator. Also the part with the
interracial couple that lost a son in the war was moving. It added a
very real, tangible characteristic to the movie.What I didn't like so much in the movie were the petty personal attacks
on the Bush administration. I mean, Bush is a puppet, an idiot, but
that's all old news. Did the movie really need the scenes of Bush
golfing, of Bush forgetting that saying (at the end), and of another
member of the Bush admin. using spit as hair gel? I think these
weakened the movie. But then, it's part of Moore's style. I guess I
would have liked it if he touched more on the issue he brought up at
the end, how the army heavily recruits in the poorest neighborhoods,
sending the "scum of America" out to die in Iraq, while the rich sit at
home and get wealthy from investments, weapons contracts, oil
contracts, and whatnot.

It was so nice to hear fact in this movie, instead of opinion and fatal
conjecture on TV. The film is top rate, very moving, clever, intense,
funny, so well written...It was incredible - I don't know where he was
able to collect that footage!! Revealed secrets... Amazing. There were
moments where you could hear a pin drop among us. It was an eye opener
and an astounding event. One, rich movie experience. George Bush has
embarrassed Republicans and this country long enough. I wonder how many
people will be afraid to see this film? Where's their courage?? Believe
me, if they saw what I saw - they'd WANT to know the information in
this movie. Otherwise you'd have to conclude they are cowards and
ostriches - burying their heads in the sand - just too afraid of it.
And who wants to conclude that? Not very pleasant...It would astound
them how little of this footage and information they've gotten from the
news sources they've been using.

I am a 34 year old male from London England. On Sunday just gone, I saw
the "controversial" film that the insecure right-wing media in America
tried to prevent their own citizens from seeing ...The excellent
Fahrenheit 9/11.There is no way you could even pay American citizens to vote George
Bush back into a 2nd term after seeing that film. Shame on the
Republican voters for actually believing in this BUFFOON. Didn't they
check out his credentials before backing him? The theatre that showed
the film was PACKED OUT. People had to stand along the aisles just to
get a view. In all my years, I have NEVER witnessed a cinema packed out
like that for any blockbuster. And the film was just in its 2nd week of
showing in the UK.The film exposed a dumb stupid, corrupt, lying, crooked crook as a
President, that values lining his own pockets more than the lives of
his own people. He instructs the equally dumb American media to drive
"scare tactics" on the public so they can support him sending troops to
Iraq to combat a so-called "terrorist threat" so his sinister "secret
agenda" of getting the oil from Iraq as well as winning rebuilding
contracts for his republican friend can be realized. Then all of a sudden, things seem go a bit sour.No.1:- No Weapon of Mass Destruction No.2:- Over 900 US troops got
killed and thousands permanently wounded. Coffins and the wounded are
sent back home with little or no media attention, the wounded needing
lifelong treatment. The able bodied troops that are left in Iraq have
to stay much longer and are now homesick.So now, who are the people that the government are targeting to join
the army and "PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK" to help out in their ILLEGAL war
effort? Yes you've guest right, its young black adults. Yes, the same
black adults that were denied voting rights in the Florida 2000
election.Yes the majority of the US troops out in the FRONT LINE "which runs the
highest risk of war casualty" in Iraq are usually black, Hispanics and
poor whites. The Republicans see young black adults as fresh meat,
people with no future, a convenient candidate to risk death or
permanent injury just to help the rich white so-called upper class
elite get richer.I like the part in the film where Michael Moore confronts Republican
cabinet ministers to enlist their OWN children to fight in Iraq. They
all responded by running away, ignoring him or looking at him like he
was nuts. There is only one republican cabinet minister who has a kid
fighting in Iraq.If I was in power, I would send Tony Blair, George Bush, Rupert Murdoch
and the socalled upper class elite, every Republican cabinet member,
their children and supporters of the war to Baghdad right in the heart
of the fighting WITHOUT guns and ammunition. "Then they will understand
the true meaning of terror." Yes, let them put their own lives and
money where their mouths are, and do their own dirty work, along with
the help of their war supporters.At the same time I will send the US troops along with the coalition
troops back home. When the film finished, there was something else I had not witnessed in
all my years of cinema going... There was a big long round of applause
and cheers throughout the cinema, plus on the way out and even onto the
street, that film was the topic on everyone's lips.Hats off to Michael Moore. America should celebrate him. HE IS A WORLD
HERO.

The American people have been lied to this whole freaking time, and its
about time that someone stood up and revealed the truth about President
Bush. An excellent movie it had my eyes wide open with interest the
whole time. Great movie would refer it to everyone before elections,
and you'd just have to be ignorant not to see the truth. I was always
sort of suspicious about our president, but this really clarified
everything to me, and it also opened up more things about Bush that I
haven't even heard of. I will try to inform anyone I can of this movie,
and stress the importance of seeing this and being informed. Michael
Moore is really a hero in portraying the real side of Bush and his
administration!

I had heard a lot about this movie before seeing it (Who didn't?) so I
knew a little about what to expect. However, when I came out, I was
shocked, stunned, dismayed etc.I don't go to the theatre to see movies very often, and it's been about
15 years since I went to an opening night. They are absolutely correct when they say this is not just a movie,
it's an event. The theatre was packed and there was electricity in the
air. The ushers were actually checking tickets for everyone, even if
they had already gone in.I can't remember ever sitting with an audience that clapped, cheered,
and just generally reacted to what they were seeing. I don't know if
everyone was in agreement, but they were affected by what they saw. One
man in front of me yelled out at the end as Bush was mangling yet
another speech.Even though I gave the movie a ten, and I stand by my rating, it wasn't
perfect. I didn't just willingly believe everything and I don't like
the way some of the info was presented. (possible spoiler ahead)For example, the victims of the patriot act were all white and when he
said, "do these people look like terrorists?" I thought to myself,
"Well, they could be" If you watch it with an open mind that is all I ask. Don't just
willingly believe all of it, and don't dismiss it outright either. It's
important for everyone to have an open mind. If it's all true then Bush
should be impeached and face jail time. Some people in the Bush camp
won't watch it because they think it's untrue. This is denial. Why is
it so difficult for these people to even entertain the idea that Bush
has done wrong?That's what I have done. I am willing to believe, just like I was
willing to believe it when Bush told us that Saddam had WMD's. I gave
Bush a chance and he messed up. If they do find WMD's, then I will
support Bush again.Another thing that was "wrong" with it was there was not enough info in
it. I have read so much more about Bush since seeing it. I have been
reading websites and books that go into a lot of detail about 9/11,
things that were only touched on in Moore's movie.I have also been watching the right wing and I have seen their
criticisms. These consist mainly of "It's not true" without any further
explanation, and personal attacks on Moore's weight.So watch for yourself and judge for yourself, but most importantly,
keep an open mind.

Actually I was surprised. I had read a number of reviews, and I
expected to see Michael Moore up front, preaching against Bush.
Instead, I saw, mostly GW Bush, on camera. As a professor of economics,
calling on students in class, I have seen them tongue-tied, lost,
confused, and befuddled, but most of my students were just out of high
school. GWB is President of the United States.The movie is entertaining, but thought provoking. The juxtaposition of
the poor enlistees, the Iraq war wounded and dead, and GWB's political
base hit home. The expression on the congressmen's face when asked if
they would help their sons and daughters enlist was telling. I watched
GWB with his daughters standing by, and remembered how Eisenhower was
angry with Truman when Truman brought Eisenhower's son from the
fighting in Korea to attend the inauguration of his father. Eisenhower
said, "Truman had embarrassed him' His son shouldn't have left his men.
Imagine GWB's daughters sacrificing by leaving the campaign to join the
army and go with the troops into harm's way. Now that would impress me. The movie is one sided, but we have heard the other side in the
speeches of Bush and others in his administration. I can't wait to see
the tapes GWB's campaign people will drag up to show Clinton, Gore, and
Carter shaking hands and chumming with the Saudi rich.

I am not good at this but i well say i am a hard person to please and i
don't like things easy but this movie opened my eyes, my heart, and i
saw things that was really going on in this world but didn't see it on
the news.I well say even if you do love or like bush it want hurt you
to see it people well go see movies about killing but when a movie like
this or family movies are being shown people seem to run and hide maybe
its because the truth hurts to much to face or being IL fashion isn't
good enough.I do feel if you care at least for the childen and the
people that are fighting for our country you could give this movie a
try. It was so powerful for my first time that i cant wait to see it
again and its well worth my time. {Thank You Michael Moore}

I admit that I went into this movie very skeptical about it, I figured it
was just a load of political drivel....but it wasn't..at least not
entirely.There were plenty of cooky jokes on Bush and the rest of his administration,
the usual conspiracy theory (some of it valid, some of it a stretch) about
connections between the Bush administration and our enemies in the war on
terrorism, etc... but the most important part of the movie were the lives of
ordinary people.Several times the film spent its focus on lives lost in Iraq, Afghanistan
(on both sides), and emphasized a sense of needlesslness of it
all.Like anything, such arguments about the reasons for a war are
perpetual...yes, a dictorship was removed, yes there are economic benefits
to the U.S. for going to war, and yes...there can be no diminshing of the
torment and anguish over the lost of loved ones...civlian and combatant
alike.But still, as with when it first happened, the one thing in the movie that
tore my emotions asunder was the brief time spent on the actual attack on
9/11/2001. Moore chose to black out the screen and just give sounds... just
hearing the jet-bys and impacts in the buildings made my mind swarm with
thoughts of what horrible things must have been experienced by the
victims...and thoughts of what in existence could possibly lead anyone to
commit such whole sale slaughter...3,000...3,000 lives lost..many instantly.
I didn't lose a love done in the attack, I wasn't anywhere close to it
physically, but it still sends a chill down my spine.

This movie is a great movie for people who like bush or dislike him.I
never liked him before this movie came out.I tried to be reasonable
because of course being the president of the u.s is not easy.By
watching this movie most of my suspicions were true some, people might
think other wise but i would rather not have George bush as a president
any more.This movie really really opens up your eyes by letting you
know so many things you would think a human being is not capable
of.Even though people think this is all fake unfortunately it's
not.Their is a very touching story of a mother who lost her son in the
war.It breaks your heart to see things like that especially when they
are not the only ones.We will probably never have a perfect president
but i really think all that has happened in the last four years could
of been prevented.Actually maybe not all things could have been
prevented but at least most. This movie is not hurting anybody it's
just showing the other side of the story.My opinion is that if none of
this were true president bush would not of made such a big deal of it.
Because by doing so it kind of showed me he had something to hide that
he didn't want the American people to know. So go watch this movie and
see the other side.

I've been a fan of Michael Moore's work since 'Roger and Me', but until
'Bowling for Columbine', even I had to admit that his touch was about as
delicate as a palsied elephant's.'Columbine' showed us a more mature Moore, spending less time in front of
the camera and more time behind it, weaving a powerful portrait of the
American gun culture.  In 'Fahrenheit 9/11', we finally have Moore in full
flower as a documentarian--a biased documentarian, certainly, but a
documentarian nonetheless.  What enrages his critics most is what he does
best: he takes material from the public record, and puts it together in one
solid piece.  Call it propaganda if you like, but he didn't put any words in
anyone's mouths--the record is what it is.  How you view it is up to
you.The decision to spend only a few brief moments in front of the camera
himself was a wise one, choosing instead for the most part to let the images
and players speak for themselves.This is very much an important film; whether or not you agree with Moore's
viewpoint, it's worth seeing.

Being such a big lover of IMDb and possessing such a great desire to
have a positive long lasting relationship with the database, I will
keep my comments brief. First off let me state the fact that I am a 22
year old man who does not cry easily (yes things have changed since the
crybaby days of the '80s, heh). In the past three years there have been
only two times where I have cried or could have cried intensely. The
first was the day of Sept 11 itself. The second was watching Fahrenheit
9/11 with my mother. Let me emphasize that had I not restrained myself
(lest my bawling disturb the other moviegoers) my crying over
Fahrenheit 9/11 may have eclipsed that of my crying over the events of
9/11. *SPOILER* My first shudder was during the opening credits as the
solo guitar song played. But what pushed me over the edge was the war
commencing sequence for the war in Iraq. The juxtapositining of the
U.S. Navy preparing to strike Iraq against Iraqi children was too much
for me. For the remainder of the movie I had to restrain myself (with
much difficulty).*END SPOILER* Exiting the theatre I guided myself and
my mom to a side exit where I basically exploded in tears. I'm sorry if
I've seemed a little too dramatic. I give this movie 10/10.

This is an amazing film. Moore always does his research, adds text,
music, t.v. clips, film clips, directs, produces, stars, etc... His
work is always a brilliant multi media project. If you really disagree
with his views it may be difficult, but just try looking at his work
and you'll see what a great film maker he is. You may even agree with
him on something - don't be afraid to try, don't be afraid to learn
something new.Even those that are against him must see the quality in his movies. If
he made garbage then people wouldn't care to complain about him. But he
obviously is able to strike a nerve in people that watch his films no
matter what your political opinion is.

Previous Moore films often contained original, new ideas.This one does not. Bush stole the election, helped by the fact that his
brother Jeb was Governor of Florida, and later by the fact that the Supreme
Court (Republican majority) blocked a recount of the votes - who didn't know
it? Bush went to Iraq because the country's oil reserves are the world's
second largest - who didn't know that? Bush convinced the American People to
go to war by playing on fear and making up intelligence, with the complicity
of the Brits - who didn't know that? The Army tends to recruit in the poorer
ranks of society where young adults have two choices: the Army, or
unemployment - who didn't know that? Young American adults got killed by the
hundred in Iraq, Iraqi civilians including young children were killed by the
thousand, all for nothing, the country's population will be worse off
afterwards (most infrastructure destroyed) and it will become a breeding
ground for terrorists - who could have been blind enough not to foresee it?
Financial circles around Bush involve oil and construction companies, all
looking forward to setting their hands on Iraq and making lots of money
there (though this looks like it will not be so easy now) - who didn't know
that? Sons of powerful politicians never get drafted for dangerous wars -
duh. Bush cannot make an intelligent summary of a situation, cannot plan,
cannot take decisions, does not know the most classical proverbs, and is,
uh, not very smart - this was clear all along.
Also, even when they were just repeating the obvious, earlier Moore films at
least introduced some spice in the form of difficult interviews (or
interview attempts) in difficult places. But there is hardly any of this
here.
The film would probably teach something to hard core Republicans - but they
will never go see it, out of "loyalty".
Yes, disappointing overall. I gave it a 7 and this is bordering on
generous.

After seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 i couldn't help but feel that M.Moore had
slightly exaggerated some contents of his film/documentary I was quite
an anti bush person but after watching this i became even more and
thats what i feel M.Moore is trying to transmit to the viewer. He shows
a completely different way of looking at our so called "leaders" of the
world. I didn't find anything amazing but then again hardly boring, He
manages to get his message out and insists on the big conspiracy theory
that he claims so often exists within the American government. Bowling
for Columbine was good but i'll have to consider Farenheiht 9/11 to be
more interesting and more fast paced.

So, at this point, it seems silly to argue any of the points Moore
makes (or attempts to make) in this film, or to discuss the validity of
any of his facts. All this has been covered in much detail by every
journalist on the planet.What I will do, is analyze "Fahrenheit 9/11" as a piece of film. Let's
get the bad news out of the way first: this film is fairly sloppily put
together. It's rather disorganized and digresses way too often
(sometimes even digressing from its digressions). However, as
infuriating as the structure can be, the material is strong enough
overall that it transcends the messy editing.In general, Moore executes his points very well. By now everyone has
heard the tale of where Mr. Bush was when he heard of the second plane
hitting the WTC on 9/11. Yet, nothing prepared me to see that look on
our president's face. That was not the look of someone who is scared
for the country he leads... it's the look of someone who wants very
badly to pretend nothing is happening in the hopes it will just go
away. Moore nicely juxtaposes INCREDIBLY disturbing comments from U.S.
soldiers in Iraq with political blather about the humanitarian causes
of war. He does the same trick a few minutes later when he shows the
devastating effects of our bombs on Iraqi civilians as Rumsfeld
gleefully rambles about our 'humane missiles'. Another chilling segment
shows Bush practicing his 'serious look' before giving an address to
the nation on September 11. Another nice move is Moore's refusal to
spare Colin Powell in his lambasting of this administration. Sure,
Powell may be the only voice of reason among Mr. Bush's peers, but he's
a part of the public deception game, nonetheless.Of course, for every four hits in this film (of which there are dozens
more I failed to mention), there's a major miss. His conspiracy theory
about the 2000 election comes off as goofy left-field trash. His
closing 'thank you' to those who are willing to fight for us reeks of
trying to appease the masses, given his underlying attitude that war is
pointless. Most of all (and I know many will hate me for saying this),
an extended segment from the teary-eyed mother of a killed soldier
falls embarrassingly flat. I do not question the woman's mental
suffering, but she comes off so poorly on camera that Moore should know
better than to put it in the film. On top of it, it's hard to see this
segment as much more than the exploiting of this woman's loss to make a
political point. Her running around Washington screaming "why me? why
me?!" is not something the public should be seeing. What did Moore say
to her? "I'm going to drive you to Washington and turn on the camera,
and you freak out, okay?"?Let's talk about restraint. For the most part, Moore holds back from
the absolute trashing of the president he could have made. Anyone who
has read any of his work or looked at his website for ten seconds knows
he absolutely hates the man. And making Bush look bad isn't hard to do.
So Moore could have made a documentary on nothing but why George is a
horrible leader. Yet instead, he mostly focuses on what one thing
George has done that affects every American. This is very commendable.
However, some bitterness is still lurking around the edges. He comments
on the soft linen sheets Bush slept on the night of Sept. 10. Who
cares? I bet Moore did too, as well as most other Americans. Linen is a
popular material to make sheets out of. Some of his 'Bushisms' are
pulled out of context and sound far worse that way, notably the
president's comments on dictatorship. Footage of Bush being on vacation
seems a bit silly too. Is Bush a bad leader because he likes to go
hunting? Geez, if only Moore had someone around him to say "Man, don't
put that in there... you're undermining your own cause." As far as entertainment value goes, Moore does a good job of balancing
comedy with the incredibly dark subject matter. Amazingly, I probably
smiled or laughed about every 5 minutes of the movie, which is nice for
a movie filled with images of countless dead and wounded. However, much
like "Columbine" I couldn't help but feel that it drags quite a bit in
its last 20 minutes. It's too long. I say that about more than half of
the movies I see, but I'm always right. I don't understand the controversy over this film. Like I said, it's in
no way a bash-Bush marathon. I mean, come on... Bush wants to destroy
all nature, have maniacal Christian Fundamentalists rewrite our
Constitution, and make us all eat oil for dinner at night. Yet, Moore
doesn't even touch these subjects (okay, maybe the oil a bit). Instead,
he focuses on making a case for America's great modern tragedy: death
and destruction on a mass scale because of this administration's
ability to weave a good story and scare the crap out of everyone.Moore succeeds at making his point, despite the film's many flaws. I
can't imagine seeing this and still thinking Bush is a good leader and
there's a good reason to be blowing stuff up in Iraq. I give him bonus
points for sheer boldness: this has to be the most direct political
statement ever made on film. He also does a good job of making a
watchable piece of work, despite the excessive length. Score: 7/10.

I was looking forward to this movie but it disappointed me. I
suppose
this was mainly because I was already familiar with the
main
revelation of the film, namely the connections between the Bush
family
and the Bin Ladens. I have also seen much worse images from the
Iraq
war.In terms of comedy there are some good moments. However, I miss
the
wisecracking and stunts that Moore used to do in TV nation and
his
other movies. Reading the Patriot Act while driving an ice cream
van
was an attempt but it doesn't come off.Some of it appears a little manipulative, especially focussing
on
widows of the war. Grief tends to obscure the bigger picture. On
the
other hand this is how it is. Soldiers go to war and some die,
often
pointlessly. Drop bombs on a crowded city and you will kill
civilians,
even kite-flying children.Moore had such good material to work with it is a shame he couldn't
do
more with it. From the rabid right wing nature of the Bush
adminstration, to the astonishing mismanagement of the Iraq war
there
is so much to choose from.
For those in the US who rely on Fox and CNN for news, this
documentary
could be truly eye-opening. For the rest of us, it is disappointing
that it does not have more bite, but it is worth seeing all the
same.

Not really worthy of the Cannes award because, when Bush/Cheney are voted
out in November, it will lose it's primary element of interest.Still, right now, it is stunning.If you happen to be a president or vice president, or a company
taking/giving money from/to them, you'll be looking for water to help with
the burn.And even a year from now, the soundtrack will still be better than any of
the lame soundtracks I've heard this summer.  There are few films so far
this year that are as exciting or funny.  Not even Spiderman 2 keeps pace. 
Considering it is a documentary, Moore deserves at least a pat on the back
for taking documentary film-making to a higher level.My only serious complaint about the film is that Moore spent too much time
with that flag waving jesus woman and not enough on many of the additional
facts that would have made his case even stronger.  Part of that can be
blamed on timing, but even most of the stuff that the mainstream news is
finally getting around to reporting now had been reported and verified by
independent organizations, not to mention people that had been actually
working for the president, a year or more ago.I think Moore may have assumed too much public knowledge in some areas, such
as with Halliburton.  He probably should have tried to make this more as an
intelligence brief for the people that rely on Fox News and the Wall Street
Journal as their only news sources.  They simply lack the context that even
people watching the other news cheerleaders have.

I've already reviewed this film, somewhere below, but after reading some
totally ignorant snipes here and elsewhere, I feel really moved to add this
to it:God bless Lila Lipscomb.  She and mothers and fathers like her are the moral
conscience of this nation, and have every right to be.  Part of the movie
may be opinion-driven (although well-backed with absolutely damning facts),
but the part with Lila Lipscomb is absolutely, 100% documentary -- her
words, her voice, her (and our) tragedy. It's a crying shame to see her so cavalierly belittled and dismissed in
public by Bush functionaries and partisans.  How dare they?  Worse, they
engage in outright lying about the subject, calling her variously a fraud,
an unwilling victim of Moore, or a simple-minded patsy.  None of which is
true!  Mrs. Lipscomb has been interviewed numerous times in the press since this
movie's US release, and absolutely confirms that a) she WANTS her and her
son's story told, b) Moore is a gentleman and a "softie" and was not
exploiting her, c) she was offered on multiple occasions editorial veto
power on her segments (which she saw no need to exercise), and most
importantly d)she thinks the movie is patriotic.Not only that, she has made public appearances with the film at benefit
showings for various groups and at premieres, and speaks quite movingly and
eloquently.  This is no dummy, folks!  This should be as much proof of
legitimacy and support as anyone should need, even Rush.  (Why does he keep
lying?)As Americans and as Patriots, we all owe her our heart-felt sympathy for her
loss and thanks for her son's service.  We also owe it to the country to
make sure that we don't reelect what Moore has helped publicly expose as
perhaps the most dishonest, corrupt, and evil "Commander in Chief" that this
nation has ever had. And, aside from all that, it's STILL a great movie!  Absolutely riveting.

I was skeptical about the film at first. I saw "Bowling for Columbine"
some time ago, and though I liked it, I knew that it was so biased and
skewed that any conservative seeing it would rip it apart. I was afraid
that Fahrenheit would also only serve to polarize, and would do no
great good for the anti-Bush cause. A friend of mine with a born-again
Baptist, republican boyfriend was going to see the film and wanted to
take the guy. I advised her against doing so, as knowing Moore's style,
I feared that it would only make her boyfriend scream "Viva Bush." But,
after the film, the guy was really impressed and now wants to see
"Bowling for Columbine."Now that I've seen the film, I understand that I was very wrong. I
think that Moore did a splendid job of packaging all the information
that was on the back pages of the newspapers throughout the past three
years. The movie is rather factual, and though it isn't as much "fun"
as Bowling, it is an experience. As far as forcing people to think and
re-evaluate the actions of this administration, I can't think of a
single thing to change about this film that would make it more
effective.Someone told me that the film would have been more effective if it
wasn't so one-sided. Indeed, Moore only presents his view of the
events. Perhaps, if all points were presented from both sides, and the
viewer was free to decide who is more sincere, Fahrenheit would be more
of a cinematic artistic success. But, I view this film as simply an
answer to the side that we've been hearing for the past three years. As
in a debate, this is the counter-argument to statements from Bush such
as "The world is safer now that we have conquered Iraq." Statements
like this have gone largely unchallenged in the headlines, and it's
about time that Moore answered.Overall, taking the past three years as a whole, media has not been
presenting us with a balanced view of what is going on, and Moore does
a bit to redress that.Also, my wife, who was under the World Trade Center as it was
collapsing, cried uncontrollably during many parts of the film. We both
think that it was incredibly powerful, even though most of the facts in
it are already known to us.

I saw this movie in my home city of Dublin, as the lights in the
theater dimmed the man beside me spoke to person on his opposite side I
noticed his thick accent straight away he was an American. I felt a bit
uneasy I knew that Micheal Moore was about unfold a story that gave a
bad image of the governing body in America how was this man going to
react?.The answer exactly like me he laughed where i laughed he sighed
and was shocked when I was he mumbled "God Damn Bastard Bush"! a few
times. My uneasiness quickly vanished.I turned to this stranger at the
end of the movie and asked him was it all true did very few people vote
for Bush in the election. He smiled and said to me " Son one thing
voted for George W Bush in that election and thats all the man needed
it was the Dollar bill" its amazing what money can buy these days!

I went to the movies expecting to write up a glowing 10/10 review for this
film.  I guess, like so many other movies that I waited patiently for months
to see, I have fallen victim to my own imagination and expected more from
this film.
...or maybe I expected less from Bush...This documentary is not as scathing as some would have you believe.  Mr
Moore knows who he was going after, and he was very cautious not to get
himself into any trouble.  Anyone who watches this film and is ignorant of
the absolute power of the worlds wealthiest people will have a bit of an eye
opener. The Plot/Moral:  This documentary shows how when people who are slaves to
money are in power, bad things can happen.  9/10The Direction/Writing:  I would like to see a director's cut.  I think the
theatrical release may be watered down a little.  7/10Overall:  I laughed, I cried, I thanked God that I'm Canadian.

We can always say that this movie reflects only Michael Moore's
interpretation of the events ... But even if it's 1% true only, this is
still interesting to see how people can be manipulated into thinking
what someone wants them to think.There are a lot of good moments where you can have a good laugh.
Brittney Spears' comments about Bush comes at a very good time in the
movie, for example.But there are also very strong moments, like the first part on Iraq,
where you see civilian Iraqis killed by US soldiers, just because they
were there. This is not blaming US soldiers, because they are doing
what they are told, and what they are taught. But this is also showing
that the world is not composed only of US citizens, but there are other
people with a right to live in the world.There is also a very good part on the US soldier that discovers, after
wanting to kill every Iraqi he met, that there is no sense in this war.
The letter received by that woman from her killed son is, I think, very
meaningful of what a young American (or a young person at war for his
country somewhere in the world) can feel ..I have always thought this war never should have been ... But I will
probably not get any friends in the US for that. However, I just hope
this gives some thinking material to US citizens once they see this
movie.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is made to be a moving piece of media. The film seems
to be, even though a little biased, well-researched and
well-documented. I have always been a little annoyed with those who
make there money off the dead, like many companies did off of 9/11,
both explicitly with "United We Stand" and "9/11 We'll never forget"
stickers and shirts. Michael Moore seems to have a tendency to do the
same, with "Bowling For Columbine" and now Fahrenheit 9/11. However, I
do find most of the film to be good and moving, like it was trying to
do, I still wonder: "If the Administration is this intricate with it's
control over the American people, how can we be sure that this movie
isn't another part of the control?" George Orwell's "1984" seems to
have more meaning today than ever before.

This quote is from the article 59 deceits in Farenheit 9/11; "In this
report, I number Moore's deceits. Some of them are outright lies; some
are omissions which create a false impression." If this is true that
the movie contains outright lies then why does the writer also say
this? "Moore's editing technique of the election night segment is
typical of his style: all the video clips are real clips, and nothing
he says is, narrowly speaking, false." The writer (Dave Kopel)who is
trying to prove the documentary is full of lies is admitting that Moore
typically tells the truth but because he's trying to skewer him he has
to call them narrowly true. Are they true or not? Why is he saying that
Moore's style is to tell the truth but starts out telling his audience
that the documentary contains outright lies? Well it might be that he's
not as informed on the issues as Michael Moore is. The writer admits
this in his article; "Of course if there are any genuine errors in this
report, the errors will be promptly corrected. On July 5, I removed a
complaint about a Presidential approval poll number, which I had
wrongly thought was not supported by data." Be very careful about the criticism's of this documentary. The fact
that this is a true story leaves the Bush backers nothing intelligent
to say. The fact is these facts tell a story of corruption and greed
and monumental blunders that no reasonable person could ignore and this
is why they are arguing the minutae of the movie because the greater
facts are true.Bush is the worst president this country has ever had. He's destroyed
the goodwill we had in the world. We are more hated now than at any
time in our history. He tried to strong arm our allies into supporting
a war they were to smart to support and he tried to punish them for
their refusal to rubber stamp his reasons. Now he's gotten us into deep
(censored) and desperately needs our allies help to pull this off
correctly and surprise surprise none of them are jumping at the chance
to help us. The only way to change our image in the world is to make a
regime change of our own. We have to tell the world that we are
embarrassed as Americans to have this guy running our country. We need
his loss to be an apology for letting this guy rule us for four years.
Voting for Bush is saying we don't care about anyone in the world but
ourselves.

There is a bigger message here than just Bush's mistakes. It has to do
with a failure of the public to listen to what's happening, and a
failure of the press and other media to tell us when the emperor has no
clothes on. All the information in the film was available to us but we
were too lazy to get it, and too easy to accept the spin put on by Bush
Cheney and Rumsfeld. The press reported what Bush was saying and not
what he was doing. When he started to move substantial numbers of
troops to Iraq's boarders it was clear that we would invade. Yet Bush
kept telling us that we could avoid war, when he had no intention of
stopping the invasion. Where was the press? It has to do with having a
leader with Bush's ignorance of history and a lack of appreciation of
war's consequences. The country elected an under educated and under
read president who couldn't imagine what would be the consequences of
his actions. He is a person who must rely on the judgment of others
because he does not know enough to exercise judgment of his own. He
needs to have his people give him alternatives to choose from. Hence
the seven minutes of inaction after hearing about the second plane
hitting the world trade center. I think Moore hit the nail on the head
when he guessed that Bush just didn't know what to do. He needed to
have Cheney or Rumsfeld give him some alternative courses of action to
choose from, and they weren't there. So he just sat. When Bush does
make a decision it's not based on what he learned from history or on an
appreciation of the consequences of his actions, instead its based on
what his faith tells him to do.This thinking is what resulted in the Iraq mess.What the message of the movie is to me is that the people in the USA
need to have an appreciation of what war is really like, and how bad
the consequences will be. We need to see the bodies dismembered and
lying on the ground. We need to see bombs explode, people getting shot,
and the soldier's stumps and artificial limbs. We need to have a number
from the pentagon as to how many of the 5000+ wounded have artificial
limbs, are blind, are paralyzed, or are destroyed mentally. We need to
see the pain of the mother in Flint, and how it is magnified by the
fact the war was a war of choice. We need see the pain of Iraqis and
realize they hurt just as badly as we hurt. We need put a number on how
many have been killed, is it 10,000 or 30,000.Who is shown by the film to be ultimately responsible? It is us: the
people, the press and especially the Congress. The people swallow
anything the President tells them. The press won't report what is
really going on. And congress seems willing to go to war as long as
their sons and daughters don't have to do any of the fighting.

Though it probably isn't news to most of the world that democracy in
America has long been more a fact of advertising than a fact of life,
the degree to which the corporate news media practice censorship is
bound to shock even the staunchest knee-jerk Bush supporters.Starting with the reporting of the election, censorship of the Senate
refusal to support the protest by African-American Congress members,
through the egging of the presidential car on its way to the
inauguration, this film documents the shocking failure of the press to
honour its obligation to the American people.The movie is an understated indictment of the coup which put and
maintains George Bush in power, and as such could have been sub-titled
"The Triumph of Mediocrity".

This is one of the most important movies of our time. Michael Moore
cannot get enough praise for having the courage to put out there what
has truly been a great cover-up, and affecting all our lives. In a
vastly entertaining, engrossing and edifying way, Moore has transcended
the silence of the media and given us so much information that hasn't
been reaching the people of the United States and the world. If it
appears to be a conspiracy, well, it is!Moore did his research, and presented the truth about the Bushes, et
al., their buddies the Saudis, and how as ordinary people we are all
suffering because of their greed for money and power. Moore has shown
how a tiny group of the highest order of criminals are running our
country and how powerless most people are to do anything. I thank him
for doing what he's done.

I am not going to tell you about the movie. If you have seen it, i
don't need to. I you haven't seen it, you better do.The movie opened today in Belgium (europe?). Can't say the place was
full but then i guess a wednesday afternoon with poring rain is not
really the moment to fill up a theater. Reaction of the public? Laughter in the hilarius moments, deadly quit
when things got real. In the end there was applause, again not a lot,
but more then i ever heard, we don't applaud in movies.On leaving, there was a line waiting, and the press was around asking
people their opinions.Man was i glad i could go out in the pouring rain, it really was the
weather that reflected my mood best.What struck me most are these American boys and girls that are fighting
right now in Iraq. I don't dare them calling men and women, they are
boys and girls. Many look hardly older then the 17 R-rating age.THEY (almost) MAY NOT GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE, BUT THEY MAY GO TO FIGHT
AND DIE IN IT !!Over here, when I was young, there was a military draft, so most of the
military age guys ended up serving their year in the army. Service
could be delayed by studies. I first went to college and then to the
army.Those boys & girls who now fight and die in Iraq were hoping to first
serve in the army and then to college. Some will never make it.It is an injustice!! It is an injustice that starts all the way at the
bottom, and goes all the way to the white house. Michael Moore brings
this to the screen. Go and see this movie Spread the word ACTPeace

I was in awe watching this film documentary. In awe with the
cinematography, the information revealed and how "so true it is". Once
again "Michael Moore" raises so many controversial questions "in your
mind" and to the public eye about how we, as the "general public" are
so programmed to think and believe what the media delivers. And also
how and why we [as a society] have become so powerless to change it. If
you like political and social Melodrama and cutting edge technology
film-making, you need to see this film. It is films like this and
"bowling for Columbine" and "the Big one" that make Cinema well worth
going to.

I watched this movie 3 times before i made up my mind about it, and I
read a lot of forums and articles about it. I really believe the movie
could have been much shorter... the first hour really delivers
sufficient blows to make even the most cynical of conservatives think.
I Live in the UK and the BBC reports the current political events very
differently to the US news broadcasts i have seen. I mean had we been
shown that kind of ambiguity and lack of answered questions in the
months leading to the decision to invade Iraq by Tony Blair, he would
have been instantly ridiculed. In the UK the political debate about
going to war begun much later only when the US decided they had enough
reasons to go in and summoned their ally did we have to start deciding
whether Britain should answer the call. Watching the US President
blatantly not disclosing information and not even giving reasons for
it, to us Europeans it looks incredible. If a politician is asked
something and he replies in that vague ambiguous manner that Michael
Moore shows many US Govt Official using it would look like a comedy.
Not even the ever dramatic Italian parliament delivers comedy on this
level, and they fist fight over soccer matches! I can't believe the
American people actually voted for this clown! Thank you for showing us
Europeans that despite your infinite superiority you are not perfect!
You guys mess up just as much as us except with a much bigger magnitude
(you guys like to do things 'BIG' the American Way! So unless somebody
does mange to discredit Moore on the Important facts, not the little
details, this documentary maker form Flint Michigan( God everybody
knows about Flint now ,Ha!) has made a movie that might topple the
scales of what the movie depicts to be one of the most dangerous clan
of people on Earth! An average fat man has possibly changed the minds
of 1000's of electors, and as far as i can recall no other movie has
had this kind of effect.Thus this is the most powerful movie ever made!

I really did not intend to see this film, but unexpectedly
my
brother expressed an interest in checking it out. Unexpectedly
as my brother, like my aunt, likely had voted for Bush in
2000.
My aunt had already sent an email with the title "Unfarenheit"
so I guess she had missed the Fox News memo that all
references to it should officially play off 7-11.Yawn...But hey, at least they both did see the film. The reason
I
intended not to is that I thought I would be largely familiar
with what Moore was trotting out.  And honestly I was,
although
I was not aware of the roll call of representatives desperately
seeking a senator. And yes I am aware that John Kerry was
a
senator then. Al Gore lost the "dot race" a long time before
that.Anyways back to this film per se, which will prove difficult in
any
review, professional or otherwise... Another even more fascinating element was the heat-seeking
doggedness of the two military recruiters. Those bad-video-game
"Army of One" ads don't have anything on these sales soldiers.
It
would be interesting to watch an entire documentary on those
in
that career.I didn't laugh very much (the Dragnet collage got me...I
confess).
Thankfully he left off freedom fries wrapped in duck tape and
so
forth. I did cringe a lot; not just when the rest of the audience
was
laughing, but at the barrage of the blistered and bombed
bodies.
The sub-plot of the Lila Lipscomb brought forth the most
complicated emotions... While I cannot comprehend her grief,
the tragic circumstances certainly were not incomprehensible.With two young infants myself, it is harder and harder for
me
to "theoretically" contemplate the draft. Even though I know it
and
social security are probably in the same vote-proof "lock-box"...even though I can guess the economic trajectory of my
life,
while not senatorial in stature, should likely dodge the issue,
I
still find myself wondering if as an aspect of our democracy,
mandatory conscription would not be fitting; albeit with
options
like they have in Germany.This country is worth dying for, this government however
may
not be. It seems like it never has been in my adult life.
This
film sure won't stem the flooding tide from Watergate coursing
on down. At the same time, mass graves anywhere in the
world
require intervention. I think this is the "civil rights" issue of
our
day, though I don't think isolationists will look as ugly
and
outdated as racists eventually. But do file me with the
liberals
who think we should be in Iraq today...Again the specter around this film, and around politics in
general,
is far more complex than any "evil axis" type of thinking. Any
time
I hear a politician use the word "evil" I'm immediately preparing
to
set my  jaw against them...the problem for me with this film
is
that I think Moore paints with the same limited colors too
much.
Additionally he tosses in a plea for simple decency for the
troops
(that's where one battle today is it seems, whose troops
are
ultimately "ours?")Another skirmish seems to be broken out along the line
of
"if only 10% of this film is true..." Well 10% of this film is
true
in relation to *any* political candidate (Kucinich merited a
9.8%
but we can round up.) The Republican responding volley
aims
for the film as de facto (and yet factless they would have
us
believe) campaign financing. My opinion regarding the film...see it with someone you
are
least likely to agree with. Then have a meal with them,
and
talk about whatever issues spring out of the film for you.
For
my brother and I it was unwarranted wiretapping...I was
surprised at my difficulty in conveying to him what a bad
thing this would be.Or skip the film, but don't skip the meal. I know it is
tough
for folks who put in 40 (or 50 or 60) hours a week to digest
a seven-discourse meal. I know that presidential elections
can seem to have all the trappings of student body elections
(with no option to vote for Mickey Mouse). But we owe it
to
ourselves, we owe it to our kids, and we owe it to the
thousands
of Michael Pedersens.Yours for a better world (and film, this gets a 6/10 for
me...)

The long awaited punch-in-the-face at George W. Bush, delivered from the one
and only Michael Moore has finally arrived! This piece felt a little bit
more as a serious punch-documentary compared to his "Bowling for Columbine",
and were not really that mixed up with as much jokes as we are used to when
Mr. Moore is in control of the production. You really get tensed, seeing all
these facts that binds the U.S commander-in-chief with the drill for oil in
Iraq, the help to the Bin Laden's, and so much more. It's a strong
experience, and I, always being an complete piece of anti-Bush, do feel
after seeing this that hopefully all republicans (and all other innocent
Americans) will wake up from their sleep in the fire, and regain control and
peace in their country. I wish them the best, so does Michael Moore I
believe by this documentary. A must see at all costs!

Despite the fact that this documentary, on many occassions, used statements
made by bush and his staff to discredit almost everything he'd done since he
took over, there was not a single lie here.  Bush has set up America to put
up a public display of incompetence in front of the rest of the world that
we only knew from the actions of France (lol).  Seriously, the documentary
tries to justify Bush's attack on Iraq, and suggests that all things
remaining equal, and assuming, that Bin Laden and Al Qaeda were responsible
for 9/11, why Bush chose to let the Bin Laden family leave America without
questioning them like so many other Middle Eastern or South East Asians
were.
The documentary also attempts to explain why Bush went into Iraq, and does a
pretty good job of connecting the attack on Iraq to leniency shown to the
Bin Laden family.  All in all, it shows that there is no justification or
reason for American presence in Iraq.  Also, despite the fact that there is
not any solid proof that shows that Bin Laden was responsible for 9/11, when
the US agreed that he was responsible for it, he was still given plenty of
time before the US military actually attacked where they though he
was.
All in all, fantastic.  It's funny, entertaining, disturbing and will give
you an insight into the business that George Bush runs, and holds more dear
to his heart than the United States of America.  And for the love of God,
tell the Texan doofus to stop playing golf on camera and making lousy
comments.  We know he's a fool; he doesn't need to put that on
video.

Michael Moore is a passionate person and believes in his cause, and
this movie reflects that. As he himself says that he made this
documentary in order to get rid of Gearge W. Bush, and boy did he do a
good job! I am not American and even then when I saw it I was really
filled with strong emotions. F9/11 makes a great case as to why Bush
family has screwed this country, and possibly the rest of the world.
Most of the accusations have been backed by some form of fact or
another. Though I am not a lefty or a righty, and so after the initial
shock, I did feel that I was used and this was an exaggeration so I did
look up most of the things he said on the net and some of the stuff was
verifiably true.That Michael Moore will be a victim of his reputation is also
inevitable. Most right wingers will never like it or agree to it. But
then no one can change their views. I wish anyone who watches this
movie, either right wing or left wing, should not get carried away by
emotions and after watching should at least try to try to verify the
all the facts, and I guarantee that he/she would be find that most of
them would be found to be true.I must say that I felt touched by the movie because it made me realize
the true cost of war, a war without any reasons, and I do hope that
Bush doesn't come to power again so that the world can be a more
peaceful place.*** SPOILER ***The accusation that Michael Moore makes that Bush stole the election of
Florida, is such a serious charge that if true it would be a huge slap
in the face of the democracy of this country. It should be investigated
till either it is proved or disproved. Also why didn't any senator
approve/recommend (dont remember the right word) the statements made
by the African American Congressman, that the names of their
constituents were missing from the Ballot. I would like to know this.

	There are no words to describe Fahrenheit 9/11. It's garenteed to be a hit
with its target audience because it tells them what they want to hear. Its
target audience: the same people who sat in the theater with me. They range
from the extreme, the people who think that wearing deodrant is surrendering
to the enemy, to the slightly more `normal' ones who just find `Bush
bashing' to be a perfect way to pass the hours. The movie delievers Michael
Moore's (and only Michael Moore's) opinion on the Bush administration.	We all remember Michael Moore. He's the man who wouldn't leave the stage at
the Oscars in 2003 because he needed to get as much of his political
commentary crammed into his five minute acceptance speech as possible. He's
opinionated and not afraid of it. Although there are a lot of people who
might be afraid to disagree with Moore because he never fails to make people
who don't follow his lead look incredibly foolish. And in Fahrenheitt 9/11,
his target of aim is George W. Bush and the administration. And foolish he
does make them. There is never a shining moment for out Commander In Chief. 
If he's not ignoring his country to play golf, he's forgetting the words to
an old saying, he's lying, etc. 
	Conservatives who are hailing Mr. Bush as their hero should not bother
attending this film. Go see the light-hearted Shrek instead. However, should
you be home to an open mind, this is a must-see. Those who are complaining
about this film are saying the Moore is creating a web of lies and with
holding information and taking things out of context. I see all these as
ridiculous complaints. If a documentary maker showed all the information at
head, no point would ever be made. That's the purpose of a documentary, an
opinion, one point of view. And as for the accusation about lies, how
Moore's stretching the truth too much, how this cannot be true. Are these
people just afraid to admit that this might actually be the truth? Michael
Moore is just another version of Jo Public trying to understand why innocent
lives are being taken everyday in Iraq. The conclusion he reaches is one
that will make the viewer laugh, cry and think twice about the hierarchy
system that is the base of out society. ****/*****

I like Michael Moore a lot, but he can sometimes be annoying even when
you agree with him. I was looking forward to "Fahrenheit 9/11" but I
had heard so much about it I was already sick of it before I saw it. I
wasn't prepared for the absolutely staggering, emotionally devastating
film that it is.Even if you don't agree with Moore or like him, there is no denying
that this is powerful, powerful stuff and so timely that it hurts.
Whether you think George W. Bush is awesome or if you agree with Moore
that he's an incompetent, moronic douchebag (I'm in the latter camp),
this film is essential viewing, if only to let you know what's actually
happening in the world in a way that the news won't show. You can come
to your own conclusions. Despite the heavy subject matter, there are also frequent moments of
levity that are appreciated (my favorite being a product demonstration
on live TV). But even with these, you will leave deeply affected, no
matter what political party you lean towards. Moore puts a human face
on things that most of us don't like to think about. Whether you buy Moore's assertions about the ties between the Bush
family and the Bin Laden family is up to you. I'm not sure, but I do
know that white men in suits can get away with a hell of a lot, and
sometimes they do.

War is horrible! Our government has to hide the real face of war from
us or we would never ever support one ever again. We don't get to see
images of children and women who have been dismembered or had their
skin burned black from bombs...or flag draped coffins of dead American
soldiers...or get given the count of the physically and mentally
wounded...or find out the body counts of the "enemy"... It all gets
presented like an exciting video game.Fahrenheit 911 lets us see a little of what war REALLY looks and feels
like to the people are fighting it and who are the victims of it, and
it's heartwrenching and disgusting.The movie doesn't paint a very pretty picture of the Bush
administration who made this Iraq war, or of their motivations.
Dishonest and deceit! Every American should see this movie, and then
start thinking about what we can all do to make this country stand for
something again.Powerful movie-making.

Moore does it again. Sure, he doesn't offer both sides of the story,
and he doesn't prove each and every finding or conclusion he mentions.
But i get the feeling the film's purpose is not so much as to convince
people that things went exactly as he describes. The film's purpose
seems to be, to MAKE people THINK more and think BETTER. Even if half
of what he describes is true, it really means that the American people
(and everyone to an extent) have been fooled for years.And it has been
EASY, because no one gets informed.Moore wants to change that, and he
already has changed people, with his films and TV series. Fahrenheit
9/11 is just the next step.And it is a good one.

One wishes that Moore had stuck to plain fact telling and not resorted
to making it an overly personal diatribe in between...showing Lisa
whose son had gone to war for long sequences...made the story lose its
hard hitting edge. And in places the movie seemed to have purely
gimmicky tactics, showing Bush's hair getting touched up in the
beginning helped build the introduction in a satirical fashion but
repeating it within the movie seemed overdone. After all anyone who
faces the camera does the same. Moore kept going off on a tangent like
soliciting senators to send their children into the army, but also
unearthed some utterly human characteristics and memorable moments -
like the young boys sent out to war who walked in with a 'rush' playing
rock music and came out disillusioned with the very purpose of war.
Overall one wishes he had stuck to more hard hitting facts with his
personal commentary rather than following some personal agenda of his
own to make it into an utterly believable film. All said and done, this
film would certainly have quite a negative impact on the Bush camp.

When I saw Bowling for Columbine, I was blown away by the depth and scope of
Moore's conception of what he wanted to say about gun violence, all in the
context of a commentary on the Columbine massacre. Poignent moments abounded
in Bowling and Moore makes his main point perfectly clear - Why do we
support a culture of murder in the United States so willfully?In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore focuses in on the President, his cronies, 9/11,
and the War in Iraq. Each of these targets is portrayed in Moore's
inimitable way. He actually seems to undress them, if he can't do that, he
unmasks them. As in Bowling, he brings the "center" way to the left, as he
presents the left of center view as the only right and sensible one. That is
the main value of Moore's films, in addition to educating, these films
explain how to attack exactly what is wrong with America today in an
optimistic, humorous and humanistic way - and in doing that, he sets an
example for everyone. If you haven't seen Michael Moore's other films, definitely see Fahrenheit
9/11, because it is his best work.

To be honest, I didn't go in subscribing to the total MM view.A couple of things first:-This is the sixth film that I have heard people applaud (showingmy age; Soldier Blue, A Boy and His Dog, Titanic, Barbershop, ThePassion of The Christ, and Fahrenheit 9/11), certainly for differentreasons, but nonetheless, each seems to be in line with theothers as tapping into some visceral emotion.-I'm not sure what others think, but this film (frankly, an opinionpiece, not a documentary; kind of a 150 min. Andy Rooney set),sets out the case against Bush.-Even given the view of Moore,  it would seem that the contentionsof the film will be refuted with facts.  It would seem to me that ifthese contentions are not refuted with facts, that that is part of theconversation.Even given the view of its maker, this film is a presentation of whatis best and worst of this country.  I would ask the viewers todetermine each within their own construct.As a suggestion, I would say that it is the people of this country that are its strength.  This film reminded me of what I recently heard a4-star General say, as a justification for war (any war), namely "Youhave to be able to look your own kid in the eye and say that youmay die to do XXX (in this case remove Saddam).".  The moral to Fahrenheit 9/11 is, to me, would you be willing to sayto your kid, "I believe that  your life is worth removing Saddam frompower".  Well is it?I understand that this film is a polemic.  But it is a worthwhilepolemic.  It contributes to the national debate...

This movie has taken a lot of heat from right-wingers because it is
extremely critical of President Bush. In America both the movie and the
response to it are allowed and it is heartening that both are taking place
when so many factions in our society wish that it would just go away or be
banned.From its opening detailing the Florida fiasco and corruption to its close
which shows Bush characteristically fumbling and mumbling through a
commonplace piece of folk wisdom its argument is that President Bush is not
deserving of nor fit for the office that he holds.And a persuasive piece of argument it is too, reinforced by information and
images not seen before - at least by me - and interpretations often decried
as unpatriotic.It's my belief that as many people as possible should see this movie
especially if they leave the theater as angry as I did but for the opposite
reason.It's July 3rd as I write this, I can't think of a better movie to see on
July 4th.

FAHRENHEIT 9/11, Michael Moore's new documentary, focuses on the happenings
prior to and following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. More
specifically, it focuses on Bush's actions concerning the attacks and how
shady it all seems to be. It seems to be a pretty unnecessary documentary,
considering half of America (or more) already knows this and feels this way.
But it is already, needless to say, very popular and making tons of
money--somewhat ironically.I think Michael Moore makes great documentaries, even if they are incredibly
biased. This film is no exception--nearly every scene is trying to exploit
the opinion that Bush is an idiot who never deserved to be elected. And
while I agree with a lot of the opinions stated in the movie, I can see that
these same opinions would upset a lot of Bush's followers. I won't state any
of my own opinions here, because this is not the place, but the movie is
certainly convincing in what it chooses to debate. And there certainly are a
lot of facts that have been overlooked by many (including myself) and will
make a lot of the people in the audience think, "Huh. Never knew that. How
interesting." It really is remarkable some of the links and ties that are
pointed out in FAHRENHEIT 9/11--but this could just be the use of clever
editing and bias.I think Michael Moore's last documentary was much better than this
one--although, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE also had a lot less to be biased about
and it wasn't on a subject as touchy and uncomfortable as our president and
one of the most awful, high-profile terrorist attacks on our country in
history. FAHRENHEIT 9/11 does not disappoint though--it has its fair share
of good points and powerful moments (a lot of the scenes involving the
mother of a dead soldier in Iraq are very heart-wrenching and moving), and
even throws in some good humorous moments. But it's very one-sided (as is to
be expected), and almost pretentious in its delivery.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is likely to be a huge hit, and though it's incredibly
biased and will be hated by many for this reason, it makes its point.

It's curious how people assert this film is a pack of lies yet offer nothing
to support such a claim. Moore's detractors (and Bush's apologists) should
either put up or shut up.The movie does a good job of arguing that George W. Bush is not the rightful
heir to the presidency. That he is in cahoots with the Saudis, and
specifically with the bin Ladens. That his real loyalty is not to the people
of America, but to a small clique that controls most of the country's
wealth. That during his presidency America has become reviled, especially in
the Middle East.Moore shows, by example, that there is nothing wrong with pointing out the
hypocrisy in our leaders and questioning their motives. Most democracies
excel at this sort of thing, although the United States has stumbled lately.
Nowadays, being "a patriot," as Britney Spears demonstrates, means keeping
your mouth shut and agreeing with whatever the president says. This approach
has worked wonders in democracies like the Soviet Union and North Korea.My favourite moment comes early on, when outraged protesters pelt the
presidential limousine. The rejection of Bush's bona fides is symbolic of
the divided nation. What a crying shame the media didn't let people know
what was happening at the time. Did they think it wasn't newsworthy or were
they just too afraid to show it? What else have these cowards refused to
show us?I think this worthy film will change very few minds. The wealthy and the
extreme right will vote for Bush regardless. God himself couldn't change
their minds. Ordinary folks will continue to despise him. What it might do,
however, is help motivate the electorate to get out and vote in
November.

Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 needs no introduction. It has been the
most-talked about, most anticipated, and most profitable film of it's
kind ever. Not a single newscast in the last month went off the air
without mentioning this highly controversial film. I have been waiting
anxiously for this film since Mr. Moore announced that he was going to
make a documentary about the Bush administration. I was a little
worried that because of it's anti-Bush content that it may never be
released in public theaters. But fortunately it has thanks to Bob and
Harvey Weinstein.The documentary itself was well worth the wait. Moore shows a lot of
stuff you already know, but the way he shows it really hits it home. It
is not all new information, however, as Moore shows footage and
interviews and gives facts about the government that you have never
seen or known before such as the ridiculously low number of rangers
guarding the state of Oregon. There are vintage Moore moments as well,
such as when he rides around the capital in an ice cream truck reading
the USA Patriot Act over the speaker. However, the film has a more
serious tone than Moore's previous films. The most moving part comes
when Moore follows and interviews a mother who lost her son in the war
in Iraq. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theater.Fahrenheit 9/11 is the most important film of the year and probably the
decade and should been seen by as many people as possible. And yes,
even more important than Spider-Man 2. 8/10

I came out of this movie angry as hell! This movie only confirms what
a lot of Americans already suspected about the W. He is quite frankly
ignorant and not very intelligent at all. I'd like to see Bush send his
daughters to go fight in the front lines. I can only say that if any
body truly loves this country, it is Michael Moore!!! His movie is
realistic, with a twist of humor to make you bare it all. And believe
me when you find out about the ties between the Bin Landens and the
Bushes, You'll need every ounce of humor so that you don't vomit at the
theater!!!!!!!!!!!! Not only does this movie have humor, it backs up
all its facts by showing you all the documents that were obtained to
prove them. Go see the movie, then go vote Bush (better known as
Mini-Me) out of office, so he won't hurt any more American families.

In my country, The Netherlands, Bush is not very popular and you can call
that an 
understatement. Let me start that almost every detail in this movie was not new for me. The
so-called facts, 
and with that the whole package of moral issues, Michael More delivers to
the audiences are 
at least a bit doubtful. However, the movie itself is extremely well put
together. You might 
see it as an anti American propaganda movie but I think it's not fair to put
it in such a 
perspective.The most comments I have red so far are extremely enthusiastic or mend to
talk this piece of 
documentary under the dirt with a big cross on it labeled with the word:
Traitor!I red comments saying Moore shows only the bad things American soldiers do
once they're 
based in Iraq. But `what if' he does so? Is one soldier making mistakes not
one to many? And 
is that not a general fact that should be the rule for each country on this
planet?
In war people make mistakes, sure, but on what ground is a war based in the
first place? 
Would America had been to war if oil was not in stake? And if that's not a
question I'm able 
to ask, and if the only reason to go to war was to liberate Iraq from this
dictator why is the 
United States army not based in Tibet, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and many more
states like in 
Africa government by dictators or are being threatened by neighbors?If it's truly a war against Terror, where are the neutral morals and above
all, the highly rated 
Democratic standards, in this conflict between Israelis vs. the
Palestinians? Surely, everyone 
with some knowledge of what's going on the world should ask these questions
where human 
lives are at stake. Is that not one of the principles of Democracy in the
first place?Despite the one way look around of all these questions trough the eyes of
Moore, the 
questions on themselves are to important to let go just to please some
`critics'. Being critic is what Moore is, and despite people like it or not, there is
enough endless 
amount of pro Bush commercials due the next election that this documentary
is at least 
welcome for those which don't consider a speech of Bush as the only right
spoken one!I'm sorry to say this, but in my mind Bush is at least a criminal, at least
he's considerate to 
be one in my country by more then 80% among the people. (According to last
investigation).
Even more, The United States government is considerate more dangerous all
together then 
the Muslim fundamentalist. And this documentary just had proven why people
think that 
way.Only that should at least make people think `why?' and that's just what
Michael Moore does, 
nothing more or lessGood educational documentary for those who has the guts to open their
eyes!

This was not the best Michael Moore movie (Bowling for Columbine) or
the worst (Canadian Bacon), but it makes some great points. Does it
largely impugn G-Dub by association? Certainly. But the liberties that
Michael Moore takes with his innuendos aren't even close to those
employed by Rove and Gillespie when discrediting many Democrats. I
would be just as happy in four years to see a movie like this about
John Kerry if he turns out to be as monumental a failure as George Bush
has been. Unfortunately, most Republicans spent so much time justifying
their votes for Bush in 2000 that they can't generate enough humility
to admit that he stands to be the American Nero. If only Moore had let
Bowling for Columbine speak for itself, instead of using the bully
pulpit two years ago at the Oscars, there would have been more seats
filled by many more people who needed to see that movie and who need to
see Farenheit.

Before you go vote, you owe it to yourself to see what the president's
been up to. You may not agree with the opinions of Michael Moore, but
all the fact's are true (double checked by the head of the New Yorker
Magazine's fact-checking team), and that's all that really matters,
isn't it? There's a reason there's so much outrage about this film, and
this president. That's because it is so revealing, and the angry people
probably don't want you to see everything that's revealed. These are
the people that are bringing "freedom" to the rest of the world. Isn't
it funny that those are the same people that are trying to get a movie
banned for exposing the truth about our leader? No amount of censorship
can rewrite the past, oh wait... that's why you have to see this movie.
While you still have access to the truth. But find out for yourself,
then make up your mind, then vote. Exercise your first amendment right.

Moore is back, faster meaner more aggresive than before.  With more
publicity than you could shake a stick at, Moore has produced Fahrenheit
9/11, a look at the 4 year legacy of the Bush presidency.In the end though as a movie fan FIRST, and a staunch CRITIC of the current
administration second, I can only say that Moore's atempt in this film comes
off as too didactic and too much of a raging diatribe.The rage is already apparanet.  Look at the postings on this board, and the
polarization of the voting.  People are either producing 10's or 1's. 
There's a lot of emotion involved obviously in it simply because of the
film.  The film is simply too much of a rant, and not much of a
story.Moore's message is there and it's probably the most 'damning' expose I have
ever seen.  However, for the most part the payoff becomes a complete
preaching to the converted, or the complete opposite of stigmatising people
and enraging their hatred of Moore even more.  This film isn't going to sway
anyone.Moore's biggest problem stems from not putting a story that we don't already
know.  There is some great trademark Moore humor in the film, and he does a
great deal of shutting up most of the time and let the audience connect the
dots, but there are only a few interesting personalities and what special
moments in the film come off as very stagey.The documentary called "The Control Room" about the Al Jazeera news network
is much superior documentary compared to this film.  There you will see real
people and get the idea of how the media can shape a conflict, and it does
what a great documentary is known for, capturing those special moments on
film as they happen and you can't plan for.In all, Moore has hit a home run and lots of people will be asking plenty of
questions afterwards, and yes its entertaining, but there's far better out
there, even from Moore himself.  America will have more questions after
seeing it, and it's a landmark important film historicaly that people will
be talking about for ages, but it is not the best film, not the best doc,
and not even the best documentary on the media and Iraq.  But it is worth
seeing I can guarantee you that.Rating 7 out of 10

Michael Moore hates President Bush.  So do I. In the weeks before the
invasion of Iraq, when it looked like protests the world over might have
some effect in preventing this flagrant lie of a war, I took part in a
couple of demonstrations in front of the U.S Consulate here in Toronto.
That's my disclosure of bias in favour of `Fahrenheit 9/11'.There is very little in this movie that regular readers of the Atlantic and 
Harper's haven't read, or regular viewers of the CBC and the BBC haven't
seen.  What is new is that it has all been put together in a neat visual
package. Michael Moore has chosen (wisely) to keep off the screen and  let
Bush hang himself.   The most affecting scenes are of two women: Lila
Lipscomb, from Flint, Michigan and an anonymous Iraqi woman, who's grief and
rage must stand in for all Iraqi women.  What started out as a war to ferret
out non-existent weapons of mass destruction and then changed to a war of
liberation has now turned into a war of occupation for the financial gain of
the few. If the Iraqi people didn't hate America before the war they
certainly do now.I think of the late author, Barbara Tuchman, who, if she were alive today,
would be furiously penning a new chapter to her book `The March of Folly'. 
I don't think she'd mind that Michael Moore has done it for
her.

One never expects government to be squeaky clean and on the level with all
its actions. One accepts that back-room dealings have always been part of
politics, and you can just hope that little real harm will be done by them.
I live in Ottawa, Canada, where last year it came to light that politicians
had been lining their pockets with millions of dollars funneled through
advertising companies. It was embarrassing, and much was heard about it in
the following year's election.But the level of sociopathic greed and bloodlust exhibited by George W. Bush
and his merry cabal of lunatics in Fahrenheit 9/11 has really sunk the
standard of government to a new low. We've heard all this before, but seeing
it all recounted -- one crime and lie after another, by a Michael Moore who
does not shy from expressing his outrage over Bush's conduct -- is a
revelatory experience.Simply as a film, it's not without its flaws. It's been well-established
that Moore has toned down his impish humour and personal omnipresence in
this effort, but there are some sections -- notably the segments documenting
all the James Bath and Carlyle Group intricacies, and a marathon of "Iraqi
occupation home videos" -- that run perilously close to becoming dry and
uninteresting. Some more personal presence from Moore might have avoided
this.The rest of the time, however, it's phenomenally effective. Moore's uncanny
gift for picking exactly the right tunes to give images an editorial slant
has not lessened, and his narration is as cutting as always. The editing is
pure satiric brilliance, from the normal game of juxtaposition, which is
played more shamelessly than usual with a montage of Iraqi children playing
in the last seconds before the invasion; to the insertion of strategic
subtitles (dig that John Ashcroft music video); to a digitally touched-up
recap of the Afghanistan campaign that has to be seen to be believed. As an
added bonus, Michael Moore has finally found a subject worthy of George
Orwell quotes. The ending montage set to one of the most crucial passages of
"1984" ends the film on a perfect note.And then there's George W. Bush. I have never had any respect for the man,
but the indictment of him presented here made me want to bash his head in
with a brick. He is a man who ran on his father's name credit alone, won the
party nomination by the skin of his teeth, failed to win the election, was
averse to lifting a finger during his first nine months in office, and then
exploited the 9/11 tragedy to rob Americans of their civil liberties and
squander the lives of the country's troops on his Iraqi ego trip. I don't
expect that anyone who seriously supported him in the first place will be
convinced otherwise by Fahrenheit 9/11. They'll be just as enraged by the
film as his detractors, but in a very different way. They'd do better not to
see the film at all, and thus claim they did nothing to inflate its box
office take. The same treatment I plan to give that upcoming obscenity
Michael Moore Hates America.

Moore, for all his faults, does provoke thought.  One thing that struck me
early on was the apparent necessity to target a villain in place of Osama
bin Laden.  A sustained focus on bin Laden could have greatly damaged the
Bush administration, given the hasty departure of the bid Ladens from the U.
S. and the long-standing relationship and mutual financial interests of the
Bushes and the bin Laden family.  Unfortunately for the administration, Saddam didn't do a good job in his
role as the villain.  He was nowhere near being the dangerous threat we were
led to believe he was.Several scenes really stand out:  the somebody-please-tell-me-what-to-do
look of President Bush in the Florida classroom after the WTC buildings had
been hit, the anguish of those who lost loved ones in the war and the
terrorists' attacks in the U. S., the grief-stricken Iraqi female calling on
Allah to destroy us, and the frustration of the soldier at giving freedom
and seeing hate in return.I'm not sure this is Moore's best movie, but it is well worth
seeing.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a bold, brazen attempt by Michael Moore to bring down the
George W. Bush presidency, and it just might succeed. Much of the movie's
damning evidence against Bush is circumstantial. Some of it is exaggerated
or taken out of context.
But Fahrenheit 9/11 presents so much compelling evidence with so much
emotion and passion that it could be the most effective political tool to
ever come out of Hollywood.
In addition to being a skillfully crafted documentary that should be the
odds-on favorite to put another Oscar on Moore's mantle, Fahrenheit 9/11
should be a future case study in movie marketing. Moore successfully hyped a
minor controversy with Disney into a big deal, then let the right wing
blunder their way into making it into an even bigger deal. In the process of
trying to prevent people from seeing the movie, the right wing fuss is only
raising the curiosity level.
If Bush is indeed defeated for re-election by a small margin, he might have
good reason to blame this movie and the man behind it.

The images speak for themselves.  I remember being so surprised a few monthsago to learn that the government was opposed to the newsmedia broadcastingimages of the coffins of the Americans killed in the Iraqi war.  Why?
Shouldn't we 
be allowed to see everything about this war--good and bad?   Images arepotent--and the images in Fahrenheit 911 are profoundly disturbing--from thesuffering of the "collateral damaged" innocents--children, old people,
families, to 
the thoroughly disgusting look on President Bush's face as he minces andpreens on the camera prior to his announcing the war with Iraq .  Wouldn't
you 
think he'd be overwhelmed with the gravity of the situation and with what he
was 
just about to announce?  Instead we get those sneaky little grins--Wow!  For
the 
first time, I am embarrassed to have such a President.  Everybody should seethis film.  Even if you are put off by Mr. Moore's political opinions, you
still should 
see those images, too often missing or glossed over by the mainstreamAmerican media, but heartbreakinly shown in this extraordinarily powerful
film..  
People from overseas should also see this film--they have to know that not
all 
Americans slavishly followi the dictates of our current administration--we
are a 
widely diverse country--and this film shows that so vividly.   With insight,
clarity, 
understanding, pity and anger--our current situation in the United States
and its 
position in the Middle Eastern world is put under the microscope.  With such
a 
controversial film, perhaps we each see only what we want to see--but at
least 
he's making us see.

Moore's film is factual, nobody has yet successfully debunked any of
the facts presented in the movie. Where are the lawsuits? What has some
folk's panties in a knot is that Moore spins the facts. Well, DUH, it's
not as if everyone out there spins facts, it's just he spins them in a
way that the government does not want you to see. So, if you call a
spin a lie, well then, everyone is lying. The film certainly evokes emotions in its viewers. Moore is his usual
effective self in presenting one side of an issue. Those that say he
should state both sides of the issue do not understand the nature of
documentary film-making. Anyway, does the Bush Administration consider
both sides of an issue? No, they do not, and they are smug about it.
So, on one side you have the government presenting only one side of an
issue, and Moore presenting the other.See the movie and you at least will have broadened your view. Those
that will not see the film are neglecting their obligation as good
citizens to examine all views on an issue.

I, like many of the like-minded friends I know, flocked to theaters the
opening weekend. I missed it Friday, but got in Saturday, and the place
was packed! The object: to put "Fahrenheit 911" in the top five
ballpark, and keep it from vanishing from theaters. I'd said prior to
seeing it that, although on a smaller scale, this was the liberals'
"Passion of the Christ," a movie swarming with so much preconceived
gossip that like it or not, people will go see it. (For the record, I
never saw Mel Gibson's controversial movie) Still, while it only mildly
surprised me that the movie made No. 1 at theaters, I was shocked when
I heard it made something like two million more than "Bowling for
Columbine," the other highest-rated documentary, causing Moore to
out-do himself.The movie, undeniably, is an opinion piece. A movie made with an agenda
in mind, and I don't have to say what it is. You probably already know
Moore's feelings about President Bush, or you wouldn't even be reading
this. From the opening scandal surrounding the 2000 election, to the
filming of Bush & Co. getting ready for their speechmaking. (Wolfowitz
salivates on his comb to slick his hair back) And then, the Trade
Centers are hit... We don't actually see the planes hit the towers, but
rather, we hear them, then are faced with the astonished and saddened
faces of people standing in awe. Paper's flood the air with a cloud of
smoke. But we do see Bush, sitting quietly in a Florida elementary
school, contemplating the news in his head during a photo-op. And so
starts the Bush-bashing, an ambiguous yet slanted look at long ties to
cabinet members, their ties to oil, the real Ahmed Karzi, and Prince
Bandhar of Saudi Arabia.The movie demonstrates the lackluster conflict in Afghanistan, where
too few soldiers were sent, and took too long at getting to al Qaeda's
suspected locale. Then the War on Terror. In one episode, a woman is
asked to take a container of breastmilk from the plane, yet another man
is allowed matches and cigarette lighters. During this time it is
estimated that there would be eight Troopers on duty at any given time
in Oregon. (Nice defense from terrorists) Then they show how Bush used
the tactic of War on Terror to coax politicians into lending support
for his Iraq plan. The details of any infamous incidents in Iraq are
not covered, although troops are seen playing around with a couple of
POWs. Some soldiers talk about listening to music during their
fighting. One song they listen to seems tailor-made for killing.Michael Moore also follows Flint, Michigan resident Lily Lipscombe, a
patriotic "conservative Democrat" whose daughter served in Desert
Storm. Her son is stationed in Iraq, and when he dies, she is
transformed into a grieving mother, one who never thought such a
tragedy would happen.The whole film is punctuated by George W. Bush's worst moments in front
of a camera. As for Moore himself, he remains behind the camera for a
good bit of the film, better to keep the audience focused on the
business at hand.Will it sway those who are not initiated? Swing-voters are likely
targets, but Republicans, unless extremely moderate, won't even see
it, most likely, let alone vote on it.

I was a very naive person before this film: with daily affirmations of
the natural goodness in people,believing that no politician could ever
do so much evil.That people were more paranoid than they need to be.
But 9/11 changed all of that. Living here in NYC. I wanted justice from
honorable leaders with integrity and firm character
conictions..However, this film with the actual footage of GWB saying
from his own mouth, how he, had his fathers'(Bush Sr.) ear for a price.
Blew me away.It was in fact about money and oil and how to hide it.What
were the real reasons about the attack on Iraq? Cheney & GWB and crew
never looked so different to me.I am so upset that the media has
attacked the messenger(Moore) and not focused on the message.It is not
about if Clarke gave the okay for the Bin ladens to leave or in fact
one senator does have a family member in the armed service. IT is the
fact that NOT anyone in the media has addressed the major charge of the
Saudis money trail and what they got in return from the group.

As someone interested in the documentary film tradition, I would not
call this a documentary. I would compare it to a political cartoon like
"Doonesbury". Moore takes delight in playing the role of court jester,
with humor, farce and innuendo mixed together with terrifying and
dismal reality.Overall, it is much more entertaining than I can imagine any straight
documentary to be, so its audience will be that much broader. I saw it
on a Monday night and the theatre was completely packed. It's hard to
imagine anyone seeing this film without being outraged, in one way or
another. Perhaps several ways at once. If this leads people to do their
own research and find things out for themselves before election day,
the country will surely be better off.

The other IMDb-ers have really hit the nail on the head in their positive
reviews of this film. This film left a heavy feeling in my heart and a
burning in my stomach at Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Wolfowitz, Rice
and Powell for their lies and deception. It is a must see for those still
not understanding what the controversy is over the Iraq war or those who are
still undecided about whom to vote for in November. The segment in F9/11
about the stolen 2000 Florida election is one of the most moving, powerful
and disturbing things I have ever seen in a film. I believe that Michael
Moore is a true American patriot because he questions those in power and he
exposes those that abuse that power. Any Bush-lover who calls Moore a
traitor or un-American or says he hates America (love that one) is just
showing that they, themselves, are being un-American. Remember and live by
the following quote from a great American:
"To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we
are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public." [ Theodore
Roosevelt ]

What a crowd for a Monday, 11:00 a.m. performance. The ropelines from
the weekend were still up. The audience, from the responses at certain
portions of the film, seemed to be anti-administration -- that's
anti-administration, not anti-American and not anti-military. Nowadays
a person must explain himself lest he be falsely labeled. At the end we
all left, in silence and in disgust. Thanks to Michael Moore and his
staff. I would like to see a film that counters the contents of this
film. If you viewed Fahrenheit 9/11, you know that is impossible. Where
would a Republican find, for example, a woman whose house was just
bombed thanking the Americans? Who among the senators and the
representatives will be telling the camera about all their children
serving in the military, esp. Iraq? How will the connections among the
Saudis, the Bushes, influential corporations otherwise be shown? One of
the most disturbing images was the actual recruitment of non-elite
teen-agers by US Marines. Was that real? How was that filmed? One line
to a teen-aged boy: "May we cross you off our list by talking to you
now? What is your name?" What list? Was that real? How was the footage
acquired? It was so like telemarketing: a response to every response.
Scary! The most amusing part in addition to those silly faces was the
Bonanza segment. A sickening scene was the make-up one, especially Paul
W.'s styling his hair. So much went into this film, and so much, if not
all, will remain with the thousands of viewers -- the bloodied,
mutilated arm of the young boy, the swaddled, dead infant, and the
agony of the mother whose soldier son returned home by way of a
flag-draped coffin. And she was not able to have any kind of access to
The White House! A great film.

Ironically, I came to this movie excited as hell but left it without
much to say....that's only because much of what Moore brings up in his
docu was already thoroughly researched/discussed. The problem is the masses. The masses that gave Bush 49% (or 51% if ur
a neocon) of the vote only because they saw more of him on TV than any
other candidate, or the masses that would treat the latest scare on TV
with the utmost gullibility.Our mass media paired with this majority of uneducated, "Do what you're
told", distracted everyday people has caused our "consent to be
manufactured" (Love ya, Chomsky) and means those of us who are not
automatons of the American dream are left out, almost completely
silenced.Thank god for Michael Moore, a man who throws out the truth and gets
%$^& thrown back at him. He has effectively turned the theaters in
which his film is played into deprogramming stations for the masses.I've only read a few other great reviews for this film, and I am eager
to see what the spinsters on CNN/Fox/NBC/ABC have to say about it. In
fact I challenge Bush, Sean Hannity, and that little b****** who made
the "MichealMooreHatesAmerica" film to publicize their negative input.
We'll see if they get the same warm reception

Great film that does an excellent job of re-capping the last four
"blunderous" years of George W. Bush. Michael Moore is obviously biased
in his assessment of the Republican administration, but his facts are
that. Facts. Why were so many highly placed Saudis allowed to leave the
country before the F.B.I. could question them? What was the pressing
need to invade a sovereign nation without the approval of the U.N.,
thereby breaking the U.N.'s most fundamental tennants? Why did Bush do
nothing to combat terrorism prior to 9/11 and in fact slashed
anti-terrorism spending. Why was he on vacation for 42% of his first 9
months in office? How many soldiers that are fighting in Iraq come from
wealthy families? Not many. Not surprising. Rich Americans are told to
go to Disney, to continue spending while the country's poorest are
being asked to make the ultimate sacrifice. Brutal. Shame on this
administration. I hope this film tosses Bush and his ilk firmly out on
their a$$. A must see for any open-minded people of the world and
especially American voters.jw

Moore has a tale to tell, and he does it in such a way, that his
audience is not beaten over the head with the obvious or over-done. His
subject matter of 9/11 and the "freeing" of Iraq, is one that has been
well covered in the media, and yet he found and chose images that were
rarely, if ever, seen by the public eye. He uses these images, plus
sounds and narrative to sculpt a point of view, then allows the
audience to draw their own conclusion(s).This creative and informative work has the ability to make you laugh,
cry and experience a wide range of other emotions. My hat is off to
Michael Moore for this masterfully crafted film. A+++

Bravo to Michael Moore for his 1) brilliant choice of a director and 2)
bringing us such a thorough job and brilliant work!!! Thank you from my
heart for your deep and abiding love for your country and humanity.
Thank you for your truth, humor, and leadership. People have been
shocked that the election was just stolen. And then his vacations. And
then the war. It's hard to believe they just get away with it, and they
certainly have been setting us all up. They take control of the system,
and think we're stupid and victims. Not so. We are all blessed with a
vote, and we need to all encourage everyone we know to vote... against
this tyranny, greed, and lying. It's time.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a "must see" for "real" people. By "real" people I
mean authentic people, people who are aware of their humanity, whose
souls understand that we are all related and thus that how we treat
each other matters. Michael Moore tells a story in Fahrenheit 9/11 that
everyone who follows world affairs should already know, and that many,
apparently, around the world do know. The systems for delivering news
in the USA tell the stories that the powers that be want to tell.
Unfortunately, they are, for the most part, not the stories we should
already know. I heartily recommend Fahrenheit 9/11 as presenting one of
the most important stories of our time.You can't go wrong choosing to see this movie.

This is a very well done film and is Mr. Moore's best ever. It is told
mostly through the words and actions of those that have opened themselves up
to criticism. As the polling shows people are very polarized on the entire issue of the
Bush regime. I do not think  this film will change anyone's mind but if it
at least makes you think and then to check the facts out yourself it has
done more than the US media has done. So take the chance to watch a truly amazing work of film. The documentary
style is so much the richer for this addition to the genre.---SPOILERS BELOW---The part of the movie I found to be the most moving was when each of
President's staff gave their speech on why Iraq needed to be attacked and
then their statements of just a few months prior to the war talk were made
and the two statements for each person were completely contrary. It is
interesting that the facts as we know them now in Iraq support their
statements of Iraq not being a threat.

Despite many attempts to prevent the American public from ever seeing this
film, the 
filmmakers and producers prevailed - and America is a stronger, better
country because of 
it. Michael Moore opens the film in a way that immediately puts you on the
edge of your seat 
- 
and much of that tension continues throughout the rest of the movie. For 2+
hours I was 
shocked, awed, dismayed and enlightened. Whether you agree with Moore's
tactics or his 
politics, many scenes are undeniably horrifying, and impossible to
fabricate, no matter how 
creatively edited.The determined censorship efforts behind stopping this film only give it
more power. Not 
only have these efforts backfired by creating more interest in the movie,
but they also make 
us wonder, "what are these people so afraid of us knowing?" In many ways,
the movie speaks 
directly to that question. At least now we can form our own opinions. As a
side note, the R 
rating is a joke, and another example of attempted censorship - teenagers
should definitely 
see this movie.  It's important, especially since many of them may end up
giving their lives 
for a pointless cause like a war in Iraq in a few years. BTW, Moore has
challenged the MPAA 
on the rating and will hopefully win. If not, maybe he can make them the
subject of his next 
film.

There is one major flaw in this movie, which was mostly in the first half.
It really is only one-sided. When he asks questions and answers them, there
is an obvious alternative explanation that he is leaving out. It was so much
a caricature that it reminded me of when they make fun of the Republicans on
the Simpsons by portraying them as stating ridiculous things about
Democrats. When Moore tells us how much time Bush is spending on vacation,
and Bush mentions that business is being done over the phone, I believe the
latter. When he shows all the reports that say Gore should have won the 2000
election, I remember all the reports that said Bush would have won, even if
all the votes were counted. When he offered up explanations of the Bush ties
with the Bin Ladens and Saudi oil money, I knew enough real numbers to know
that was a half-truth at best. These and other sloppy edits made me feel
propagandized and almost made me want to vote Bush back into office.
Almost.However...the second half of the movie provided a lot more interesting and
(at least not so obviously un-) truthful information. The analysis of the
role the poor play in our military endeavors, and the comparison with the
Orwellian 1984 society, was brilliant. The interviews with soldiers and
their families who used to support Bush and don't anymore was enlightening.
And the subversive war footage was, if somewhat gratuitous, pretty
persuasive.There were still parts that made me cringe, but there were a lot more parts
that made me laugh. And overall, the film was quite entertaining, and it was
good to revisit some of history that we may have forgotten about. And I
think Ashcroft is a terrific singer.I recommend this movie for its entertainment value but I warn that it's not
going to convince you not to vote for Bush if you think about the other half
of the story that Moore isn't telling. Moore - next time follow through on
the other side of the argument and I might be convinced. Luckily I'm from
Massachusetts, so my vote doesn't count. :)

If you want to see a true classic in its first run, then you must see F9/11.
Wow. No film has ever moved me the way this one did. I thought the shots of
Bush, Rice, Powell and Cheney getting their hair and makeup done (not to
mention Paul Wolfowitz repeatedly putting a comb in his mouth) were an
ingenious prelude to what was to follow. That there is actually existing
footage of this stuff is stupefying.
Nothing in the film can be easily discredited. It's all real footage of the
people involved just "doing what they do", including Michael Moore (who is
on screen for maybe 10 minutes). 
I think a lot of the people commenting on this film could not possibly have
seen it yet, although I think pretty much everyone will see it eventually,
whether they admit it or not. And they should. It will change you; I know it
has changed me.
Thank you, Michael Moore, for your courage. And thank God for your talent
and genius.

Whatever you think of Michael Moore (& don't think for a moment that I like
him) this film represents what the US media SHOULD have been doing since the
events of 9/11/01 but have completely failed to do so (Note also I've no
problem with the invasion of Afghanistan, so don't call me
"unpatriotic").The way that the Bush administration has railroaded, bullied & arm twisted
the media & the people into following their mantra (9/11=Sadam) is matched
only by the media's willingness to go along without question.One criticism of Moore's film is worthy of note, several people have pointed
out that cinema isn't the place for this sort of investigative journalism.
They are correct, the media is the place for this sort of investigative
journalism, but they haven't been doing their job. Long gone are the days
when the Washington Post unearthed the Watergate scandal. Someone had to do
it, Moore took up the challenge & used the only avenue open to him, not
being an owner of any Talk Radio or TV "News" stations.Another notable criticism comes from those who dispute the facts & this
REALLY is something novel & should be encouraged on every occasion. Is the
film factually correct? Debate rages around some of the claims, although
little is said about the rest. What is novel about all this? Well previously
any dissenting voices have been immediately silenced as "Anti American",
with such unsubstantiated comments such as "You hate your country", "How can
you say this when our troops...." etc etc. To see the Right Wing Neo Cons
finally stepping up to debate facts, rather than simply slinging mud in a
schoolboy manner, is something we've not seen since before the Nixon era.
Although Moore has drawn a good deal of the usual character assasination
("you hate your country" etc etc) that makes up political "debate" these
days the inclusion of questions about the facts makes a radical & very
welcome departure to say the least!Public debate, scrutiny & accountability of our leadership is what this
country was founded on, it is why we are here to begin with & not simply a
part of Canada. It is enshrined not only in the US Constitution, but in the
History of this land & has driven its citizens of all political persuasions
to make sacrifices, even with their lives, to protect it dearly. THIS IS WHY
THIS COUNTRY BECAME GREAT & REMAINS GREAT, although now we teeter on the
brink of political stagnation & decay.This film shows us that we need to wake up from the post 9/11 hypnosis, to
steer ourselves away from the messianic, millenarian chants of
"9/11...terrorism....Sadam....fear... nuclear.... fear... WMDs...." that
pervade our current political scene. If we do not then we risk losing our
world leading position by the stifling of political free thinking, with its
benefits of economic & social promotion. I do not wish to see this Great
Nation marching in Brainwashed Lock Step towards a 1984 Big Brother, where
disenters are silenced & leaders are drawn from a tiny political elite that
views the country as theirs to do with as they wish. This is the world of
dictatorship, the Nazis, The Communists, the religious theocracies of
Iran.Moore is a bit of an idiot at times, he loves to grandstand on the screen,
but here he takes a back seat & let the facts speak for themselves. Has hit
the mark squarely in the dead center.

    I've watched the network news, CNN, MSNBC and that fabulous Fox News all
hand out pro-administration propaganda for years now. I've listened to
right-wing radio commentary take over the talk-show format.I've seen supposed liberal newspapers like the Washington Post turn into
Bush cheerleaders. 
  And now there's a bunch of folks writing into IMDB who haven't even seen
the movie, giving it low ratings and griping about propaganda?
   Phooey.
   Yes, it's Michael Moore's viewpoint. And yes, it's highly effective. It's
fine, fine filmmaking.  
And yes, I believe in two hours it can undo years of brainwashing by the
Bush administration. That's what makes it great. 
    You know, when Rush Limbaugh showed up on air, I heard about him, and
knew I wouldn't agree with him. But I at least listened to the show enough
to be able to say what I didn't agree with him about. Same with Fox
News.
   Howzabout you folks rating this movie without seeing it show some cajones
and check out the flick before you give it a 1 and regurgitate what you
heard from some right wing talking head?

Just like those of us who went to see The Passion of Christ because in order
to criticize it, you had to see it.Those who are Bush supporters or on the fence must see this movie. If you
see this movie and then decide to vote for Bush, at the very least you will
have had every opportunity to see all of the evils of this administration
and the corruption.  It is live, it is real, it is gutsy and it is the
TRUTH.  No actors, no script, real people. Those who think it might be wrong
or untruthful or fake or not true.  See the movie and then check every
single item in the movie to see if you can find a single iota of a lie.  
This is one of the most extradorinary movies of all time and it will affect
the Election.  Michael expects to have it on DVD in NY for the Repupublican
Convention.
WOW!

Leave it to Michael Moore to bring the movies to politics.  I felt that I
was in a movie directed by Kafka or Fellini.  It was way too real and
surreal at the same time.  Moore will need a talented bodyguard and a great
tax lawyer when `they' come looking for him to settle the score.  Maybe he
needs the witness protection plan.While much of F9/11 is overstated, and rhetorical, there are truths and
information that I did not know about.  These little secretes are scary.  If
Bush is something like a leader, why did he wait 7 minutes in the Florida
elementary school after being told the 2nd plane hit the WTC?  He reads a
child's book to himself and bites his lip.Then there is the Moore work of showing the Bush cabinet as the old Bonanza
TV show introduction -- very funny.  Then there is the Moore asking the
Congress people to send their kids to the war in Iraq -- very
scary.The purpose of movies is to entertain and get us to think.  Moore's file
made me do both...for the rest of my life.  Some movies should be
outragious.  This one is.

I saw this movie in a packed cinema - had to wait through three showings to
get tickets. Salt Lake City is about as extreme Republican as you can get,
yet the cinema was turning people away.
This isn't so much a documentary as a stating of the other side of the story
that the Bush camp would rather you didn't know. Like how 6% of America's
GDP can be accounted for by Saudi money. Like how the government the US put
in Afghanistan was curiously well linked with Halliburton and their oil
contractors.
Like how can Bush not have a conflict of interest when he gets $400,000 a
year from the US taxpayers as a salary, but $1.4billion from the
Saudis?Even if you're a republican, I implore you to see this film. You do know you
can be republican without supporting Bush don't you? After this film, you
will.The lady sitting next to me got up and left 30 minutes from the end. Not
because she thought the film was bad, but she turned to her husband before
leaving, in tears, and said "I just can't watch any more of this. I'm so
sorry I voted for Bush."

     It was truly amazing, as someone that lives in Utah, I never expected
to hear such thunderous applause fill the theater as the credits ran.  This
is an incredible motion picture and Moore's best film yet.  In fact,
regardless where you stand on either Moore or the current administration,
you owe it to yourself to watch the film and determine whether or not your
or the nations best interests were really being represented in the time
since 9/11.  After the film showcased the human damage suffered by both
American and Iraqi families, I find that I can no longer bear the arrogant
ignorance of this administration and will be doing my best to rectify
matters within the voting booth this November.  Every person of voting age
needs to see this film.

Michael Moore declared "Farenheit 9/11" to be the follow up to his
previous documentary, "Bowling for Columbine" by illustrating how
manufacturing irrational fears in the American public helped to divert
attention from the Saudi and Bin Laden connection to the Bush
administration and the lack of investigations of those connections
following 9/11, and instead exploiting the American public's
vulnerability that they at any time are unsafe from another dreadful
terrorist attack, all of which would fuel the war for Iraq, and none of
which could rightfully be justified in the end. (Recall the analogy
that Michael Moore makes: What if Clinton had provided protection for
members of the McVeigh family after the Oklahoma City bombings in
1996?) The bottom line: the "war" on terrorism is a giant crock.The Bush administration has some major financial ties (Saudi
investments totaling some $80 billion dollars in the American economy)
that couldn't be jeopardized with investigations into the Saudi or Bin
Laden links to the 9/11 hijackers. As the movie shows you that in the
days and months following the 9/11 attacks, little was done to do
anything to investigate Al Queda. The Bush Administration, with the
help of spineless "Dumbocrats" and the wholly corporate media,
manufactured consent for a war that HAS absolutely nothing to do with
terrorism and that we as a public, were once again persuaded by
irrational fear. As Senator McDermott said, the "Terror Level" meter
will never go down to green or blue [side note: I had never even known
these two colors existed before on the meter]. And quite rightly put,
"You can make people do anything when they're afraid." I encourage Americans to see this movie, regardless of political
affiliation, even if, as Spike Lee said when attending the premiere,
"to raise questions in your mind." Michael Moore is giving us a
perspective that mainstream media will never touch. I find it funny
that the film's critics call it part fiction. However, I'm not
surprised that the Bush administration would. Aside from the business deals of the Bush administration that are
exposed to illustrate just what a crock the "War on Terrorism" really
is, this film is most significant because it shows you just how
centralized and secretive government has become. I think the final
quote from George Orwell sums that up perfectly, to keep the lowest
social members of the population on the brink of starvation in order to
perpetuate the heirarchy. The government does it, the media does it,
and the ignorance of the people keeps the cycle going. Michael Moore always makes this point so effectively with juxtaposing
scenes. For example, there was a few minutes of footage of a hysterical
Iraqi woman who was grieving for her uncle and screaming that all of
them were civilians, there were no militias there, and that she had
just attended five funerals that week. Then cut to braindead Britney
Spears, with that glassy look on her face, saying she thinks that we
should all support Bush in any decision she makes.--Excuse me? No
dissent? Why that sounds just like a dictatorship. Or, recall the scene of the soldiers on Christmas Eve who raided an
Iraqi family's house in the middle of the night, yelling at the three
frantic women to tell them where their son is. And when they find him
upstairs, and they have him on the ground with his hands tied, the
women are crying and shouting for them to tell them what is his crime,
that he is only a college student. Cut to the next scene of a soldier
telling the interviewer that he can't understand the Iraqi's. That they
don't want anything to do with Americans. That the Americans are doing
something good for them. And then finishing up with, "I hate this
country" in referring to Iraq.This movie does not make Bush alone seem incompetent (though most of
the funniest seems come out of Bush's consistent appearance of
cluelessness), although he is well aware of the options he had to fight
Al Queda, and like he and those around them, they totally ignored it.
(Remember the author who said that they sent 11,000 troops to
Afghanistan TWO months after 9/11. And that there were more police
officers than that in Manhattan). But, it shows you how most of
government (can you call it a representative body if the
representatives don't read the bills? so what if it slowed down the
legislative process; wouldn't that be good?), and the corporations (we
see a few propaganda commercials from companies like Halliburton) and
the corporate media (especially FOX news) keep perpetuating the system
of complete uselessness. As an American citizen, it makes me angry as
hell.If you still think that the "war" on Iraq is a "War on Terrorism," then
you should either watch this movie, or pay closer attention the next
time you see it. Americans need to wake up and stop deluding
themselves.

I know the point of the film is to spark discussion but there are some
points from everyone here what they liked best, what they found oh lets
say unnecessary. I have been reading the posts here with intelligent
and idiotic comments from both the right and left. I want to invite
those who ACTUALLY SAW the movie to discuss their favorite or not so
favorite moments in a civilized manner. please conservatives, no talk
of killing any liberals,And please liberals no talk of saying that
Republicans have little penises. I keep thinking its the same 12 year
old who has nothing better to do than than just spew violent words
toward a group of people who express an opinion. And no thats not to
say that 12 year olds don't have opinions but it would be nice to hear
what young people really think about the country they live in without
going into primal/fascist ideoligies.So again the movie, your favorite moments, parts you hate, parts your
not sure about and really how did it affect you?Personally I found the army recruiting scene a bit too long. This was
an otherwise extremely hilarious, bold, and sickening film. I doubt any
republican would hold back tears at seeing a mother cry over the so
much death, no matter what country she is from or seeing that country's
children die. I fail to see any benefit to a military presence in Iraq
for the United States. One of the great quotes in history is "the more
things change the more they stay the same" I really see this in the
invasion/occupation of Iraq. The killing that continues is only
different because of the reasons behind them. Saddam killed his own
people because he was a cruel dictator and Iraqis are dying now because
they see themselves as/are an occupied people and are fighting an
occupation.Personally the movie didn't change my view of the Iraq war or Bush. I
can only say that the benefits to having this film is to realize there
are more people who share my view than I originally thought. I'd
actually like to hear from conservatives, ones who are willing to hear
both sides. Debate is necessary for a better understanding of the other
side.These are my thoughts. What are yours?

Obviously, conservatives will attack this film as inaccurate liberal
propaganda. Most of them are not going to see the film anyway.But the truth is that whether you agree with Mr. Moore politically or
not, and whether you find the specifics of the film credible, you
cannot escape the film's incredibly compelling overall message. That
the U.S. is in Iraq for questionable reasons, and that President Bush
has done quite a bit of damage to his own country. To contrast the
arrogance of our Washington leaders with the harsh realities of war for
all parties involved -- soldiers, soldiers' families and Iraqi citizens
-- was quite moving.I, for one, felt almost offended to be an American citizen after
watching this film. And yet, I feel that it is overwhelmingly Patriotic
in nature; and Michael Moore's love for the good in this country shines
through. Patriotism does not mean blindly following what our elected
leadership tells us to believe. It means standing up for true American
values of fairness, justice, and the hope for a better world - and I
think Mr. Moore succeeds in his message of this. It should be required
viewing for all Americans. It's probably not going to change the hearts
and minds of the most stone-willed conservatives, but I think it will
make a dent in everyone else who sees it.

I've read about 15 books over the last 8 months, pro and con about the
situation we are now in. However, Fahrenheit 9/11 congealed them into 2
hours of facts, people, events and actions or inactions of what got us
to where we are now. And at that, it only skims the surface. It is a
wakeup call for us to be aware of and involved in our government if we
want this nation to be the country it was envisioned to be at its
founding, and what we all thought it was until we get a peak behind the
curtain. And, it raises the issue of not just what our government was
doing, but why weren't we hearing about it! Where was the investigative
journalism that should have been bringing these facts to life all
along, so that we wouldn't have a vast number of people still thinking
Iraq was responsible for 9/11!?? We are citizens of the world, not only
our block, or our state or just this country, but the world and we had
better start becoming sophisticated and grown up enough to accept and
realize that fact. We meet citizens of all those other places outside
our homes in this film, and sometimes it is not that comfortable
because of what has been done in our name. With all the talk about "No
child left behind", we have become a country of lazy thinkers and we
aren't teaching our children to think. This film will definitely make
you think. But as my mom used to say, " God gave you a head for
something besides a hat rack....use it!" So, go see this film,
Republican or Democrat, I dare you! Even if you hate Micheal Moore.

This movie is so powerful and so well made that I am left in awe. As a
movie, it is a masterpiece of art, compelling, moving and funny. As a
documentary, it is full of information and well-done investigations.
This movie revealed many facts that we never heard from mainstream
media. Those facts are deeply troubling, but apparently true (No one
has come out to dispute the fact in the movie). The best part of the movie is the Iraqi footage. We never see them on
our TV. These footage revealed how common Iraqi people suffered in this
war and how they turned to hate America. It gives us uncensored view on
the mood behind insurgence. Sadly, this is still happening as I am
writing. "Violence generates violence", and Iraq is the most telling
example.Whether you are left or right, go to see this movie. Make your own
judgment. It is good entertainment, and a very informative view on our
world today.

After seeing this film, I would like to give a piece of advice to
upcoming high school seniors. If you are reluctant to apply to the
college of your dreams, please take notice that one of the "dumbest"
individuals of our time, "President Bush"(Oxymoron), was accepted at
Yale University. Granted, he nearly flunked out, but this should give
encouragement to those who feel that they need to be among the smartest
in the world to attend such a prestigious university. To those who criticize this extraordinary movie, it amazes me that the
vast majority that have done so, have not even taken the time to see
it. Bush supporters and their right wing constituents should take the
time to actually view the movie before commenting on something they
know nothing about. It is akin to those who supported President Nixon
during Watergate, when they knew full well that he was a no good, lying
cheat. These were the people that said that "We should support our
President no matter what. We elected him and he deserves our unwavering
support, regardless of the fact that he is a liar, a cheat, and should
clearly be serving time in jail".Fahrenheit 9/11 starts off by showing that the 2000 Presidential
election was clearly won by Al Gore. Through the manipulation of the US
Senate and the Supreme Court of the United States, Bush is
astonishingly awarded the highest office in the land. Clearly a case of
total injustice, I sat in shock for the better part of a day coming to
the realization that our country was about to be lead by a person that
was about as eloquent and articulate as the "Today Show" monkey from
the 1950's. The film depicts a stone faced Bush at a Sarasota, FL
elementary school, sitting for nearly seven minutes reading "My Pet
Goat" after an aide, Andrew Card, whispers in his ear that a second
plane has just plowed into the World Trade Center and that America is
under attack. Bush looks as though he is a deer, caught by the
headlights of a car. He told the 9/11 commission that he wanted to
project calm to the American people, when in fact he projects the fact
that he has absolutely no idea what to do.The film continues for nearly two hours, clearly displaying that the
only reason that we went to war in Iraq was that there was "oil" to be
found. There were no weapons of mass destruction, nor did the
administration have any facts whatsoever to legitimize such an
outrageous claim. The fact that hundreds of innocent lives were lost in
the needless Iraq war, nor the fact that the real war should have been
fought in Afghanistan against Bin Laden, escapes the Bush
administration, as their main concern seems to revolve around
protecting the Bin Laden family, to which George H. W. Bush has close
ties.This administration is the most corrupt and incompetent in US history.
If you are still a Bush supporter after actually viewing this film,
then you are either downright stupid, or you simply have no grasp for
actual facts. This movie should be required viewing for all citizens of
the world. There is no way that you can objectively view it and not
come away with the opinion that this country is in serious trouble
should Bush be reelected to a second term. Bush and his administration
could care less about the average American. The Bush family cares only
about "the Bush family", and nothing more. Their extreme wealth and
arrogance toward middle America only confirms that they have no concern
for you and I.Republicans and right wing propagandists, Rush Limbaugh included, open
your eyes to reality. Pick up a book and read it, go to the movie and
view it. Base your "facts" on facts. We are living in a time of the
worst governing body in the history of the United States. Don't stand
by and do nothing. Stand up and be heard, but be heard for the right
reasons. If you truly review the facts of this corrupt administration,
you can't help but to vote "Bush" out of office come this November.I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Thank you Michael Moore for your
endless hours of research and for your sustained efforts to bring this
film to the American public. Well done!

This movie is so powerful and so well made that I am left in awe. As a
movie, it is a masterpiece of art, compelling, moving and funny. As a
documentary, it is full of information and well-done investigations.
This movie revealed many facts that we never heard from mainstream
media. Those facts are deeply troubling, but apparently true (No one
has come out to dispute the fact in the movie). The best part of the movie is the Iraqi footage. We never see them on
our TV. These footage revealed how common Iraqi people suffered in this
war and how they turned to hate America. It gives us uncensored view on
the mood behind insurgence. Sadly, this is still happening as I am
writing. "Violence generates violence", and Iraq is the most telling
example.Whether you are left or right, go to see this movie. Make your own
judgment. It is good entertainment, and a very informative view on our
world today.

If you have any doubt that we are in great danger from the current
administration, you should see this movie and devote the next weeks to
working toward saving America by getting rid of Bush. This president
has made the whole world more dangerous and has earned us the hatred of
people everywhere. He and his cronies have made good people think we
are in greater danger if gays marry than if Osama continues to live,
and has directed our wealth and energy toward fighting enemies that
never existed rather than completing the job in Afghanistan. Michael
Moore nails Bush perfectly. The film is by turns heartbreaking and
hilarious. As a polemic, it may be a bit heavy-handed, but no more so
than the right wing rantings on so-called conservative web sites and
radio shows. As a movie, it is just about perfect.

I think every American should see this film. Most of those who hate it
have not seen it. It has a political message to be sure, but it also
has a more important message about who we are and who we should be as
Americans, as a nation. I could immediately see how it won the top
prize at Cannes. The way it brings together so many disparate threads
into a coherent and powerful message is particularly striking. The most
powerful moment is the "footage" of the World Trade Center going down.
If you haven't "seen" it yet, I won't ruin this clip for you. Moore's
film-making has evolved and continues to impress. Whether you love him
or hate him, you cannot ignore him. I think every American should see
this film.

Man were there a lot of hippies in the crowd. Really people, wash your
hair. Other than that, it was an excellent movie. Highly recommend.Moore makes the assertion that Bush received money from the Saudis, the
Taliban, and from the Bin Laden Group, and that this somehow is really
bad. This seems like guilt by association. I was very skeptical about
this argument. However, Moore shows how Bush's actions are not quite
logical and completely beneficial to his investors and supporters. In
one poignant moment, an FBI counter-terrorism agent says "there are
more cops in Manhattan than troups sent to Afghanistan to find Bin
Laden." The same FBI agent says that he would've liked to interview the
Bin Laden family before they were allowed to leave the country on 9/13.Moore makes a compelling argument that the administration then
manipulated the American public through fear to accept an already
planned invasion of Iraq.Moore infuses a sense of chicanery and light-heartedness at points with
a great use of pop music; conversely some moments will tear at your
heart. As movies go nowadays, this one is worth seeing.

Although it isn't Moore's best, it may be his most powerful and
certainly most controversial. Moore's assault on Bush is relentless.
From the Florida election, to 9/11, to Afghanistan, to ties to Saudi
oil and Bin laden family, and of course the invasion of Iraq--Moore
indicts Bush and his cronies for putting the interests of oil men,
defense contractors, and Saudi elites above those of the American
people, and blasts him for having the gall to ask the American people
to sacrifice their lives to make the world safe for emirs and
plutocrats. A combination of grisly and heart wrenching footage from
Iraq, featuring dead Iraqis and American soldiers, combined with the
impact of the war at home hits the viewer like a body blow from George
Foreman--it isn't as easily shaken off. I doubt that many partisan
Republicans will be swayed by this flick and that most, who actually
bother to see it rather than criticizing it from hearsay, will find it
offensive. But I think Michael Moore is okay with that, as am I. It
says something publicly that needs to be said.

Michael Moore has made a career out of pushing the envelope with his
controversial works. In general I take what Michael Moore says with a
grain of salt. In a lot ways he's the left's version of Ann Coulter,
only with not nearly the hatred for everyone that disagree's with him.
When I saw Bowling for Columbine, while impressed with Moore's overall
point and the lengths to which he tried to prove his point, part of me
was disappointed in how much he blatantly manipulated footage as well
spoke a lot of half-truths.While Moore continues to push an agenda in Fahrenheit 9/11 (to which he
himself refers to as more an op-ed piece than journalism), much of the
logical inconsistencies and half-truths are absent. Yes, there are
certain things Moore spins in his direction, like how happy a place
Iraq was during the Saddam rule. He chooses to not show the plethora of
videos available detailing Hussein's totalitarian rule. At some points
he also villainies the troops who while some of the words and actions
depicted were unnerving are nonetheless a reality of occupying a
country.But when judging this movie on not only its general truthfulness, as
well as the way the scenes are set up, the movie is a must-view for
anyone.Moore's use of music is a prime example of well-done and polished this
movie is as opposed to his previous works. Yes, he does invoke a bit of
laughter with some of his musical montages, but more so, in many cases
the music really invokes profound senses of sadness, uncertainty, and
and in some cases anger. The soundtrack during the opening minutes of
the movie, where it features members of the Bush administration being
fitted for with microphones and primped for the cameras is a prime
example.Moore does not pull punches and refreshingly does not manipulate kids
to do them in this film (a major gripe I had with Bowling for
Columbine). He does not interview individuals with Alzheimer's or have
no real basis to advocate their positions. Much of his fact checking
was solid.The only disappointment I really had with the film was that at points
it seemed like Moore was string the viewer along on too much of a
string in order to indict the Bush administration on another possible
corruption charge (i.e. the Carlyle Group). I also was saddened that
Moore once again went to one of his favorite devices to invoke sympathy
for his cause (the dying town of Flint, Michigan). Nonetheless, the
Flint pieces do still serve his cause well.Regardless if you're conservative or liberal (I tend to be a moderate
myself), it's film that one should if for no other reason that it will
inflame you (either against the administration or Moore). If were not
it not for the film rightly being rated R, I'd advocate it to be
mandatory viewing for high schools if for no other reason than it gives
clear reasons to young people that there are indeed good reasons to
vote.In conclusion, go see it regardless of your political affiliation.
Judge it for yourself, not only in terms of its views but its overall
presentation. With that state of mind it is impossible not to give the
film some credence. Moore has political agenda and he never denies it.
He makes it bluntly clear and any educated person will not that much of
what he says contains half-truth. So see it, judge it, and then vote on
it.But to leave on one important note, for those who voted it a 1, I feel
very sorry for those who did, because they can't move beyond partisan
views to see that even if the movie is a string of lies, there is
artistic merit to it.

This is a story that had to be said. I highly recommend going to see
this movie, even though like most of us, you already have your mind
made up about the issues that it addresses. He did a good job of
expressing the feelings of most people about the events before and
after 911. Here are a few strengths and weaknesses:Strength: People were quiet during most of this movie. But it was
wonderful when people would just start clapping, like when the solider
said that if he was asked to return to Iraq, he would refuse, because
he couldn't stand to kill poor and innocent people to make Bush rich.
That was beautifulWeakness: The tone was too satirical, too funny, I know no one wants to
be bored at the theater, but these are somber issues, not funny ones.Strength: He obviously spent a great deal of time researching for this
movie. It was very comprehensive, he reminded us that we did not in fact
elect Bush, he showed us documents that link Bush to the Bin Laden
family, etc. He left few stones unturned. Weakness: Not enough attention to the suffering of Iraqis. I know that
Moore knows his audience, and they are more interested in seeing how
their tax dollars are being wasted to make a few millionaires richer,
but to me the real issue at hand here is the unjustified and brutal
suffering imposed on the people of Iraq.

I saw F911 at a matinée yesterday and this movie is truly a MUST-SEE!
It's a "FAIR and BALANCED" view of one George W. Bush. Finally!It played on three screens and was sold out in the middle of the
afternoon. The audience applauded and laughed riotously throughout the
movie.Some highlights:Moore reminded us that Bush and the Taliban were FAMOUS friends before
9/11. Bush and the Taliban leaders, PERFECT TOGETHER, and on film too!
(Maybe that's why Bush gave the Taliban two months head start before
invading?)Moore also reminded us that Bush and the Saudi ambassador are SO close
personally that Bush had nicknamed him "Bandar Bush"! (I forgot!) Bush
and the Saudi Royals,- ONE HAPPY FAMILY. Especially after 9/11! Moore
has film of Bush and all his people shaking hands with the Saudis after
9/11. All of them are THRILLED to be in their august Saudi presence,
except one. Watch the look on Colin Powell's face,- just precious!
Apparently Powell is the only one who remembers 9/11, and that 15 of
the 19 hijackers were Saudi, as was their leader and their financial
support. All the other Bush people forgot 9/11 totally.The film of the war is not your run of the mill corporate-censored for
the USA stuff. It's from other sources, and Moore's own "plant" in the
Army. Let's just say it's realistic. Moore shows the great good taste
not to replay the towers burning or the people jumping to their deaths.
(We remember) Instead he shows the plight of the families. Thanks!Moore has the complete tape of Bush's response to finding out that the
USA was under attack on 9/11. You won't want to miss that!And you'll want to see the ending, that last 30-40 seconds, of the
movie,- over and over and over. Moore saves the very best Bush clip for
last. It's a doozy.PS #1: All that talk on the corporate TV about the movie being
propaganda is balderdash. Even if you shut off the commentary
altogether, and looked only at the films and listened to the Bushistas
own words, the same point would get across,- exactly. The truth may
hurt, but it's the truth nevertheless.PS #2: This movie will be a MAJOR blockbuster. Eisner's head should be
on the block shortly. Hope none of you own Disney stock. They just lost
a mint!

If MM was a G. Bush supporter, I have no doubt he could produce a film
that would present evidence and emotion to paint GB as the greatest
thing since sliced bread. Michael Moore makes no apologies for his
slanted view. However, I have not seen any evidence that the
allegations MM makes are not 100% accurate. The intent of this film is to show the American people things about the
Iraqi war that most have probably never thought of. Its very easy to
think of war in the "good guys kick ass" terms. It puts a very
different spin on it when you see 18 year old kids aka soldiers 30
seconds after a bomb has exploded and they are lying on the ground
bleeding to death. Or you see a pile of burned up and bullet ridden 5
year olds...some of whom are still alive. Makes people actually think
about the ramifications of sending troops into war...and do we have all
the facts needed to make a decision? We should ALWAYS keep those images
in our heads before we commit to war.He also outlines business and financial ties that the Bush family has
with the Bin Laden family. These are not unfounded allegations - these
are documented facts. Based on the reactions from the crowd around me
in the theater...most people had no idea. I'm glad that MM has made it
easy for those people to get that information.I didn't come out of the theater any more educated, because I pretty
much knew about everything that he had presented. I also can't really
say that I like MM's way of explaining things to me like I have an IQ
of 80 (like I won't realize that he's trying to manipulate my view of
things). However, since I've been debating the subject of the war in
Iraq with a lot of people and find that too many say "We are fighting
Iraq and Saddam because of 9-11"...I think this movie serves a good
purpose. It presents the facts in a dumbed down, slanted and
prepackaged way that some people need. If that gets Bush out of office
in 2004, I'll recommend that everyone go see it.--Tina

Technically excellent. Very entertaining. Stylish. Informative.I especially enjoyed learning about the relationships between the Saudi
elite and the Bush family. It is now understandable why Bush was able
to find Sadam Husseim in a country as huge as Iraq, but unable to find
Bin Laden in a country as small as Afganistan!The segment on the family whose son was killed in Iraq is extremely
moving. Unfortunately that young soldier wasn't the only one who died
in vain...Anyone who sees it and still votes for Bush is choosing to ignore the
facts. Those who say it is fiction haven't seen the film.Congrats to Moore for making a brilliant film and for opening the eyes
of Americans. Moore deserves praise for his talent and for his effort
to set the facts straight.

"I'm not fair" proclaimed "Fahrenheit 9/11" director and writer Michael
Moore recently on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show." Moore, the infant
terrible of documentarians told host Jon Stewart that he had an agenda
(moviegoers never would have guessed) and that his facts are clear with
their interpretation an open field.Moore probably believes this but many of his facts in this powerful but
flawed documentary aren't so crystal clear and neither are they
necessarily proven. Moore wants to see Bush defeated in November and as
a documentarian with a cause he follows in a fairly long line of
film-makers who, subtly or otherwise, have an agenda dear to their
hearts. No one will ever denounce Moore for subtlety."Fahrenheit 9/11" may be one of the only films I've ever seen where the
audience - most of them - began prolonged cheering when the director's
name appeared in the OPENING sign boards. That reflected, of course,
the political leaning of an affluent Westchester audience that was
all-white and which filled surrounding parking lots with SUVs and
luxury cars (my Honda Civic a small disgrace).Moore opens the film with a creative look at the Twin Towers tragedy.
Rather than showing yet again the planes knifing into the buildings and
their tortuous collapse, he uses sounds from Ground Zero with a blank
screen which then segues to the horrified and occasionally hysterical
visages of people on the street. We don't have to see the
collapse-Moore correctly knows that what he's done is to rip loose
indelible, horrific memories that supply what isn't on the screen. From there he goes to THE election as seen from both Florida and later
in a joint congressional section where black representatives, one after
the other, forlornly or bitterly demand the investigation into Florida
fraud that can only take place with at least one's senator's
acquiescence. No senator gives his or her signature and the scene
bespeaks yet another betrayal of minorities, here at a crucial time in
a hallowed place.Much of what follows is a demonstration of what even many Bush
supporters can't avoid admitting - he's a mental lightweight, a fool
and a clown but a man who through family contacts (especially 41's)
with both American industry and the Saudi Arabian oligarchy is one rich
fool. And his family's involvement with Saudi Arabian magnates who have
invested billions in the U.S. is well presented and will be hard to
refute.Many scenes that follow are readily familiar-Bush the very experienced
and dedicated vacationer, Bush reading a children's book in a Florida
school on 9/11 for seven long minutes after an aide whispered in his
ear that the second tower had been hit and America was under attack.
Apologists will trot out the usual vapid excuses for Bush's indifferent
attitude and lackadaisical unrolling of short (and occasionally
unintelligible) sound bites while the nation desperately needed real
leadership both after 9/11 and during a war that seems to offer no
likelihood of victory and even less of disengagement.The war in Iraq gets much play with combat scenes and footage of grisly
dead and wounded, some from Al Jazeera with a few shots also prominent
in the currently running "Control Room."Soldiers and family members are interviewed. Some troops are troubled
by the war, others are repelled morally and politically. For other
soldiers the war is an adventure, a chance to prove their mettle and
the value of their training (these troops haven't been wounded yet).
Family members are either arch-patriotic and supportive or they are
riven with tears as they recount the loss of a loved one. A broken
mother's account of learning of her son's death in combat by telephone
from the Defense Department is heartbreaking: audience members were
crying. (What happened to the claim that all such notifications are
done in person by uniformed personnel? An economy taken as the casualty
list increases?).While Moore makes the argument that the war's true purpose is to
advance American business interests (Halliburton comes in for some
well-deserved hits) and the military, especially its young members, are
fodder for the plutocrats, the case isn't well advanced by showing
scenes regularly screened in news reports and specials. It's Hidden
Agenda Analysis Lite.What is both surprising and unexpected is the degree to which Moore,
the sole interviewer, is unusually invisible, his typical
attention-grabbing shenanigans at a minimum. In one episode he
commandeers a Mister Frostie truck to drive around the Capitol reading
the USA Patriot Act to members of Congress over the loudspeaker, some
of whom admit on screen that they don't read the bills they vote for.
This isn't news but when it's in reference to the very troubling,
hastily put together and deeply flawed USA Patriot Act it's a reminder
of how much power this administration sought and received with little
careful legislative scrutiny. Almost none, in fact.Sillier and very irrelevant is vintage Moore waylaying members of
Congress and offering recruiting literature while urging them to have
their kids enlist. Enlisting or not is a personal decision-in our time
it's no longer reasonable to arraign any parent on the charge that
he/she has forsaken a patriotic duty to urge military service to their
kids. TV coverage of Vietnam started to put paid to that. I'm reminded
of that grand World War II patriotic song, "I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be
a Bomb."Moore isn't just putting out a documentary-he's urging involvement by
sympathetic viewers to defeat Bush and he has a website and a scheduled
online Town Meeting to advance his goal. That's his privilege. Make no
doubt about it: despite what some hysterical anti-Moore people are
saying "Fahrenheit 911" is very much in the tradition of film,
documentary or feature, aimed at motivating viewers to demand or make
change.I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11"at the Jacob Burns Film Center dead set in the
center of a constellation of very well-off Westchester, NY communities.
Tomorrow I'll be back in Manhattan and I want to see the film in a less
anti-Bush neighborhood (yeah, I'd prefer a second viewing in the South
or rural Midwest but I can't find the time to fly around just to see
Moore's movie again).Moore's movie is very important because his deep passion goes beyond
the self-promotion central to his previous films. He's a zealot with
regard to Bush and Iraq. That makes him both a fierce documentarian and
a lightning rod for attack. How or if "Fahrenheit 9/11" will sway
voters, especially those not committed to one side or the other,
remains to be seen. What is certain is that Moore's fevered creation is
a political milestone in documentary films.10/10

No words can describe how great a cinematic achievement this movie is -
Audiences at 12:30 in the morning at AMC Easton were left speechless,
clapping and cheering Michael Moore as he showed us how fake and murderous
George Bush is in his much hyped "War on Terror". It's innocent poor people
from small towns across America that are being drafted day by day into the
army, only to suffer at the hands of Iraqi Men and women (WHO ARE RIGHTFULLY
ANGRY - THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS HAVE BEEN MURDERED BY THE HUNDREDS TOO!)
Hope to God George Bush doesnt get re-elected - it could spell doom for

wonder how human beings can ever vote for a member of the murderous Bush

This documentary movie covers ALL the bases.It's sad, funny, moving, suspenseful, enlightening, and very very
frightening when you realize that this guy *IS* our president.  That ANYONE can support this man (Bush), speaks volumes about what kind of
person they are.   In short, in my view, they have to either be ignorant or
evil.   There is no other alternative.  Well... fortunately for the ignorant among us, they have people like Mr.
Moore to de-ignorize them (as certain presidents ignorant of the english
language might say).Although I suppose they'd say it more like "Um... ah... eh... this... uh
film... w w will will... uh... d.. de.. uh... de-ignorize people... about me
and my presidency" Seven minutes folks.   Seven minutes looking like a deer caught in the

Michael Moore is the first to say this film isn't really a documentary, it's
an op-ed piece, an open and scathing indictment of a corrupt and alien
administration which has stranded American soldiers in a no-win, no-exit
war. Taking that approach, Moore isn't going to be likely to swing many
voters in his direction. All talk of this film affecting the election aside,
however, I don't think that's Moore's real intention. He set out to make a
powerful piece about what he saw as a betrayal of American troops and the
democratic process, a piece to resound with him and others like him, and in
that he's succeeded admirably.What's notable in Fahrenheit 9/11 is the amount of restraint Moore uses.
While he usually puts himself front and center in his films, Moore sits most
of ths one out, only pulling two real "stunts." For the most part he lets
the images speak for themselves, and while there's a certain brand of acrid
humor playing through the first half, it dies out more and more as images of
the fallen and the bereaved play out on the screen.While there are plenty of cheap shots in this - images of Bush, Ashcroft,
Wolfowitz, etc. getting grotesquely made up before they go on camera, for
example - there are plenty of deeply moving, unsettling, and affecting
moments, moments that cut past partisan feelings of who should win in
November or how America should deal with terror and reach into the heart of
who we are as human beings. We connect with the mother of a slain soldier,
with the dead and wounded Iraqi civilians that suddenly become real. That
doesn't mean this movie would turn a die-hard Bush supporter into a
Democrat; I don't think it would, and I don't think it's supposed to. I
think it's supposed to put words and images to the feelings of the tens of
millions of Americans who feel betrayed by their government right
now.

Any of you cowards who voted 1/10 and obviously did not watch the film
deserve to be duped by an ignoramus named Bush. In fact, what gave you the
right (other than American free speech and press) to voice your opinion
without sampling the object you are commenting on? Before I wrote this piece, I did see the film on opening night here in San
Diego and was actually surprisingly entertained and also appalled by the
coherent and logical points made in this documentary.(I can't remember the
last doc that I actually saw). Now, I feel compelled to see some of Michael
Moore's other works. Yes, this documentary is clearly Bush-bashing, but it
is well-founded Bush-bashing, as he deserves to be bashed by any thinking
and alert and cognizant life form who has pondered his "stolen" presidency
to date. The film has a clear message and "plot", which every intelligent
American should at least consider, as I believe all the footage was not
altered. No part of this film seemed extraneous.  *** spoilers *** I
especially liked the revealed (expected)reluctance of Congressmen to enlist
their sons or daughters to fight in Iraq, and I was unaware of Baby Bush's
typically idiotic reaction (caught on tape) after hearing of the WTC attacks
on 9-11-01. *** end of spoilers ***
I applaude Moore's courage and frankness in producing this view of the Bush
agenda, and shame on Disney for refusing to release the film, as they now
appear cowardly and are about to cry at the thought of how much this film
will clearly gross at the box office. I expect this masterpiece to encourage
a higher percentage of people to vote come November. I look forward to
seeing the media's take on this film in the coming days. My rating (as if
you didn't guess): 10/10 !

It's funny, entertaining, opinionated, selective, and slanderous...and it's
not a big lie. The right can argue and spin against Moore's slanderous
editing, selective interviews and presumptive conclusions and underhanded
jokes, but when Moore presents documents on screen, and images that Bush
wouldn't dare let you see, you will know that something isn't kosher with
Bush, no matter how much opinion and slander is involved in the way the film
is made.I don't care what party you are on, you must see it if you ever want to be
taken seriously as an educated debater in my book, especially if you are
going to criticize Moore. Not seeing this film is the equivalent of plugging
your ears, going "La La La, I'm right, no matter what you show me!".
Obviously, we are never going to be swayed by "He's fat and he hates
America". See the film, or be laughed at for refusing knowledge of what he
says.The film is not about attacking the Republican party. He just targets Bush
and his associates. It's not about sympathizing for terrorists or Saddam
Hussein. He's not protesting the war in Afghanistan. There's not a moment in
the film where he says "the republican party wants this or that", and
there's no moment where he says "these terrorists are innocent victims."
Footage of 9/11 is minimal. In fact you don't see it happen. He knows we've
all seen it, and that showing it again is just rubbing it in. No bodies were
shown from that incident, obviously so people who want to claim he's using
footage of dead 9/11 victims for selfish reasons can't do
so.Moore didn't release this film to just make money. Besides, don't you
conservatives out there believe in capitalism, or only when a conservative
like yourself is reaping the benefits? You'll criticize Moore for making
making money on a film, but what Halliburton does in Iraq is just peachy,
and the Bush team using 9/11 footage for campaigning is fine and
dandy.Moore made this film because he has footage that he believes proves there is
something not right with the President, and he felt it was morally right to
share it with the public.People who accuse Moore of profiteering off of 9/11 obviously haven't seen
the film, so if you want anyone to believe anything you have to say about
the film, or Moore, you have to see the film first from beginning to end and
tell them the last line of dialogue so they know you saw
it.Remember, you can criticize the slander and selective editing all you want,
but you can't discredit the documents and footage, and therefore can't
discredit all of Moore.

I can't put this succinctly enough:  "Fahrenheit 9/11" is a pro-American
film.  This film upholds the values I was raised to believe were American
values.  This film treats our troops in Iraq with respect.  This film treats
Iraqis as human beings.  This film treats the victims of the September 11th
attacks with dignity.  This film upholds the traditional American doctrine
of war as a last resort.  The only contempt that this film shows is contempt
for those who derailed the real war on terror, and led us into a war for
profit based on lies.I went to see "Passion of the Christ" even though I didn't want to.  Why? 
Because I wanted to be able to discuss the film intelligently with others. 
I didn't like the film, and I knew I wouldn't like it when I entered the
theatre, but I went anyway because I felt it was my duty to be educated
about it.I make the same challenge to supporters of the current administration.  Bite
the bullet, pay the eight bucks, and decide for yourself.  Don't let others
decide for you.

Welcome to America people a place where we are all free to express our
views.  In America popular speech is as important as unpopular speech, and
our founding fathers believed that if a goverment lost sight of the needs of
its own people that it should be critiqued.  Michael Moore has made such a
critiqued and it is a blistering indictment of the Bush Administration's
policies after 911.  The movie is about the explotation of tragedy for
power. I won't say that much more I don't want to ruin any of it for you who
haven't seen it, but believe me this movie packs a wallop and my moderate
hide loved it. To all you cranky coservatives who damn Michael Moore and
curse his name remember this you bashed Clinton into the ground like a
stake, well guys get ready for Bush Bashing 2004 cause paybacks a well...you

When it comes to Documentaries Mr. Moore is among the best if not the best
there is.  The purpose of this type of film is to encourage the viewer to
pause and think.  This film accomplishes that and more.  There may be those
who disagree with Mr. Moore's point of view, but one cannot deny the gravity
of this film.  The facts are there for all to see.  Mr. Moore puts his own
spin on things but the facts remain nonetheless.  He has a knack of finding
the "every day person" and showing us how they are affected by decisions
made by government and business officials.  In this film that "every day
person" is personified by Lila from Flint, Michigan. I believe that "Bowling
for Columbine" was a bit more powerful film but Fahrenheit 9/11 is well
worth the money and time waiting in line for tickets.

I'm sick of reading conservative reviews on how Moore lies, twists the
truth, etc. He has nothing to gain from either Kerry or Bush winning(such as
money, power), so obviously if he is going to spend a great deal of time and
money to make this, he's doing it for a good reason.This movie wasn't as entertaning as Bowling for columbine(there are a couple
funny parts) but is just as good because it lets you in on conspiracies of
the administration, from the election to Iraq. A lot of it is archived
footage of news and of Bush, but also interviews and a couple of Michael
Moore gags where he goes out into DC and tries some funny but sad
things(like try to get congressmen to enlist there children to go to Iraq -
half of them walk away, the other half laugh at him- do we really want to be
governed by these people?). Conservatives B*tch about this movie because
secretly they know it's true and who wants to admit they're wrong? So they
back up Bush by calling this propaganda and lies.I knew Bush was a horrible person going into the movie. This flick didn't
have to confirm it for me. Most anyone who will see this hates Bush. This
movie isn't about brainwashing people's minds with liberal propaganda
because the people already hate him. This movie exposes more of the horrible
president we're under. Food for thought: isn't ironic that the first five
letters of Liberal are the root word of Liberty, which means freedom?
Hmmm....

Forget all the left vs. right stuff you've heard. I laughed. I cried. I got
angry. I became aware. I was entertained. And the time just flew by. Michael
Moore reminds me of Columbo in his understated low key approach that is
never in your face but always dead on target. This film is important. How
many movies can you say that about?? Everyone on this planet should see this
movie if for no other reason than to be part of the national debate. This
film made me think and question all the balogna I hear on talk radio and
cable tv. It is just so refreshing to hear a different point of view and
especially one that rings so true. Stop what you're doing right now and go
see this movie.  You'll be glad you did.

At this point, I feel, you either like Michael Moore or you don't. I happen
to think he serves a 
useful purpose in society and by and large I like him, although I feel at
times he's indulgent 
and overly fond of pointless confrontation. While I've read a few of his
books (and loved 
Dude, Where's My Country? which is sort of a prequel for this film) and seen
most of his TV 
show The Awful Truth, I hadn't actually seen one of his films before, so I
wasn't quite sure 
what to expect. Certainly vitriol directed at our current chump-in-charge,
but other than that 
it was a shot in the dark for me.9/11 is an effective film, but I don't think Moore's going to gain any
converts with this one 
(though it would be nice if he could shy a few votes away from Bush). At
times meandering, 
and at other times acerbically funny, 9/11 is not so much about that fateful
day, though 
that's covered; it's not even about the occupation in Iraq, though that's
covered too. Simply 
put, this film centers on the topic of just how unfit George W. Bush is to
run this country.Whatever your personal political beliefs are, that's frankly a valid
question. Here's a man who 
never really did anything at all in his entire life, and now he's
spearheading a massive effort 
to do nothing more than change the very fabric of our society. For better or
worse is up to 
the view of the beholder, but certainly for Mr. Moore it's for the worse,
and he makes a 
chilling and compelling case that you ought to at least think of things in
that way too. I don't 
want to give away too much of what's in the film, because Moore makes his
case a lot more 
strongly than I ever could. But if some of this movie doesn't alarm and/or
scare you, then 
you're either a die-hard republican or you're just inhuman.Moore mixes satire with hard hitting journalism (six separate fact checkers
employed in the 
film leads me to believe, contrary to what the conservatives say, Moore's on
the ball here) 
and creates a heady argument that this nation has allowed itself to be
scared into going very 
seriously awry. Some of the sharper moments include a brilliant use of the
`Greatest 
American Hero' theme (possibly the very height of irony, ever) and a section
of the film 
devoted to a very patriotic woman from Moore's hometown of Flint who lost a
son in Iraq. 
There are a wide variety of truly frightening moments in the film (and
again, if they're not, 
there's just something wrong with you. Or you're a republican, same
thing).Trouble is, the people who really need to see this film won't. People like
my mom, who are 
basically very intelligent people who back the president in the election
even though they 
should know better; people like anyone out there who think a vote for Nader
is even remotely 
a good idea; people who aren't dyed-in-the-wool republicans who have
questions about 
where the country is going. The people who really NEED to see this film
never will, however; 
the rich, the scared conservatives, the people who actively await the
rapture so they can 
ascend to Heaven while the rest of us shmucks duke it out with the minions
of Satan down 
here. Moore's definitely preaching to the converted, and I think it would be
a great thing if he 
was able to wake up even a small segment of the population with this, but I
doubt, sadly, 
that he will.When I saw the trailer for this film a few weeks ago, a woman in the theater
shook her fist at 
the screen and growled, `That's all bull----!' And a lot of people think
that way. A lot of 
people have been scared into thinking that way, and frankly, Michael Moore's
not going to 
shake them from that fear. I think it's noble that he even attempted to, and
I applaud him for 
it. But most people in this country are too rich or too self-absorbed or
just too dumb to care 
what's going on. More than two hundred years ago, Ben Franklin said `Those
who would 
sacrifice a little liberty for a little security deserve neither the liberty
nor the security.' And 
it's even more true today than it was then.Before you decide if you should see this film, ask yourself one simple
question: is your 
country better off than it was four years ago? If you answered yes, then you
probably won't 
appreciate this film. If, however, you answered no, or even I'm not sure,
than you should take 
the time to see this movie and see for yourself some of the reasons why you
answered the 
way you did.

 Before you vote see this movie.  Before you condem this movie or Michael
Moore you should see this movie.  An eye opener! Questions about 9/11 the
"Bush Family" and more are brought front & center in this documentary! 
Could the events of that day been prevented? Why was the family of
Bin-Ladden allow  to leave the United States shortly after 9/11, and what is
there ties to a former United States President?  If you don't read a news
paper or watch the news PLEASE SEE this movie.  I always belive before I
trash  a movie I will watch it.  I saw "The Passion of The Christ", "The
Last Temptation of Christ" and they were both well worth watching.  You will
get out of this documentary what you bring to it! So your better off seeing

Greetings again from the darkness.  Michael Moore films are always
fascinating to me as he and I are consistently on opposite sides of an issue
or argument.  This time is no different.  Moore expertly weaves a web of
footage and sound bites to make his personal viewpoint appear factual on the
screen.  He makes no attempt to hide his personal vendetta against Bush and
this is his gift to those wishing to vote Bush out in the next election.  I
give Moore his due as a filmmaker and documentarian.  The joy of this type
of film is that no balance is required.  This is the filmmaker's viewpoint,
no more no less.  America is a wonderful country because this freedom of
expression against our leader results in only anger and emotional outbursts... not imprisonment or execution.  Thanks Mr. Moore for helping me to
understand ... but still not agree with ... your point of
view.

Wow!  Someone who actually thinks less of George W. Bush than I do! 
Amazing!I was expecting this movie to be sort of depressing, since it was about
George W. Bush getting us into the war in Iraq, which I have always heartily
disapproved of.  Instead, to my surprise, there were many funny moments.  I
laughed more in this movie even than in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding."  It was
as much satire as documentary.If the information revealed here is accurate, it is definitely a film that
everyone should see, really pointing out new levels of corruption within our
government that even I had not expected.Now there were a few unfair techniques, where shots of Bush looking fairly
goofy were juxtaposed with serious or tragic shots.  But of course, Dean
opponents did no less to him when they broadcast his shouts at a rally in
Iowa, without including the background noise that he was shouting over. 
Still, most of the film was presented in a more straightforward way,
revealing a great deal of truly inspired investigative
reporting.This movie really shows how foolish people have allowed this fiend of a
president to hoodwink them.  I just hope that the people who really need to
see it actually do, and that it's not just died in the wool Bush-bashers,
like me, who go and see it.

I've seen some people's comments to suggest that Mr. Moore was "lying"
"most" of the time. Well, it's easy to say it, but not so easy to show
it, isn't it? That must be why none of you have? All those against the
movie that say there are lies entailed within - need to give SPECIFIC
reasons as to why/how.Otherwise - your comments mean nothing.. your assertions mean nothing.
You minus well say that the moon is made of blue cheese. It doesn't
matter because you have no foundation for your assertions.You narrow-minded right-wing bible thumpers are against it for
emotional reasons - not objective, reasonable ones. And that one guy?
... that said he doesn't like things that are too "one sided"? What is
wrong with you? You can't look at the evidence and decide for yourself?
You're just too much of a "fence-sitter"?This movie was excellent, and with Mr. Moore backing up everything he
said, where is the deception? The lies? There is none, which is why Mr.
Moore made the movie as he did - so you can't say "that's a lie", or
"that's untrue".. because the evidence is RIGHT THERE.This country is full off too many stupid people. Let's make sure we
don't vote Bush so we can raise the over-all IQ of everyone, hopefully.

I keep up with the newspapers because I know you won't get any real
news from CNN, FOX, or the networks. But I didn't realize how much of
the news isn't getting into the papers either. I had no idea of the
scope of the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the Bush family. It
calls into question all of our policies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel,
and on oil.Another fact I didn't know was that Bush didn't jump up as soon as he
was told about the attacks on the twin towers. He sat in a kindergarten
classroom for seven minutes after he was informed about the second
attack, until an aide told him he should probably get going. And this
is the guy claims to be the "take charge" president?This movie doesn't answer all questions. But it definitely raises
questions that we deserve answers to.

This is very much a film directed to the common man point of view. For
anyone who is a policy wonk, there is not much new here information
wise, sans the touching personal stories, but it is presented in a
coherent and compelling manner. Know going in that it is a POV
documentary and that Moore presents his point of view that is very
anti-Bush in the area of his reaction of the "war" on terrorism and his
separate war on Iraq. The way Moore shows the principle players getting
ready at the start of the film and then getting unplugged at the end,
"here starts my film, and here ends my film," is a nice presentation
piece of opening and closing. This film displays at times very graphic
images and is not recommended to young children but it is a very
important film, whether pro or anti-Bush to see, for all adults to see.

To say that "Fahrenheit 9/11" will be the most important film of this
year seems asinine, and yet ... "Fahrenheit 9/11" will be the most
important film of this year.The screening last night at 7.30 was sold out; in fact, all the
screenings for the rest of the day were sold out and even the ones for
TODAY were selling out YESTERDAY.You must, your ought, you need to see this movie, whether you like
Michael Moore or detest him. This is democracy and free speech in
action; this is patriotism at its most pure and vital and necessary.
This is what it means to be an American. How DARE anyone say ANYTHING,

terrorism, is our most dangerous enemy. Simply brilliant, simply powerful. This will be looked upon as a
landmark of cinema.

This movie made me cry and made me laugh and made me think and made me
say gosh dang it it's worse than I thought. I loved the cinematography,
the music, the angle Moore took on the actual plane attack. As we've
seen in his other movies, Moore is a master at presenting human drama,
this one is no exception. I wanted to go over there to hold and comfort
Lila Lipscomb and those nameless grieving people in Iraq. I saw it in a packed house near SLC (which is strange considering that
72% if Utah voters chose Bush in 2000) and the crowd cheered and booed
and clapped and really got into it. I've never seen people so engaged
by a movie. As we left the theater most of us simply could not speak.
We just stood there stunned, trying to figure out what had just been
presented to us. I will never forget that experience. Great show, a
must see for everyone.

I thought this movie would be full of innuendo and partisan
exaggeration. There is much less of that than I expected and much more
documented fact. It's a very powerful film.I am disturbed that the R rating is "solely for language" -- there is
one short scene where a soldier is reciting rap lyrics for a song he
was listening to which includes "motherf-----" several times. But there
is also footage of the corpses in Fallujah, a public beheading in Saudi
Arabia, and other disturbing scenes -- these are OK for PG movies now??As to the fellow to calls Michael Moore a "traitor": Loyalty to the
country always. Loyalty to the government when it deserves it.

Moore presents the OTHER side of the stories that have been reported in
the American media. Those of us who have come to rely on alternative
news sources will see nothing new to us. What IS interesting is to
notice the reactions of those in the theater that haven't been exposed
to seeing or hearing what is presented. Not meant to CHANGE minds but
to awaken curiosity in the minds that have grown lazy and much too
accepting of what is spoon fed them in sound bytes. Read

The number of votes given to this film of "1" can only be from closed
minded individuals trying to bash a movie they will never see. The sad
thing is that these people are the ones who really need to see this
movie. This movie exemplifies exactly what America should be about and
shows how the Bush administration has done their very best to destroy
this great country from the top on down. That and Lila Lipscombe's
story make this a film everyone must see. The people giving this movie
a "1" rating have just as little heart and decency as the woman shown
confronting Lila, who has the nerve to call her touching moment with an
Iraqi mother staged. It is the ignorance shown by this woman and shared
by too many others that is the true enemy and target of this movie, not
the president. Go see this film before you rate it, and if you have a
soul, there's no way you'd give it a low score.

As a student at the State University of New York at New Paltz majoring
in journalism, I know a little bit about who is and isn't a fellow
journalist. Michael Moore is no journalist; and though he never claimed
to be in the first place, my point is only that the film should be
labeled "These are my opinions, not all of them are true."Now all of that being said, this is a great film and an important film.
I have many issues with President Bush, and I believe less than half of
what he says. I feel, however, that Moore is on the opposite end and
would fight Bush tooth and nail even if Bush declared, "Today I shall
give $ 10,000 tax free to every family that makes less than x amount
yearly." I feel that Bush and his administration were not honest with
us about the Iraq War, but I think Moore doesn't even know WHAT point
he wants to make.At one point he is pointing out the horrors and constrictions of the
Patriot Act (I personally HATE the Patriot Act) and then a few minutes
later he's showing how unprotected Oregon is from terrorist attack. So
what is it; should the country step UP its restrictions, one of which
is the Patriot Act, or should they step them down? It isn't moral to
attack the government on going too strong against terrorism, THEN
change gears and talk about them not being strong enough. I think the key to my desire to have Moore have a disclaimer stating
that this is the way he feels, and not necessarily the facts, is the
segment on John Aschroft. Moore makes the comment that the voters of
Missouri "Preferred the dead guy." That statement is inaccurate because
after Carnahan died, his wife took over his campaign, and she had the
sympathy vote. What does it say that Ashcroft (who I have NO support
for; I just want unbiased coverage, something Moore clearly doesn't
give us) was leading in the polls in the week prior to Carnahan's
death? After his death, his wife took the "Soldering on" posture and
GLADLY accepted the sympathy votes in order to win the seat in the
senate. So why didn't Moore tell us that the voters of Missouri elected
Carnahan's wife, and not just say, "They preferred the dead guy." In
reality, they DID vote someone in who was flesh and blood, Carnahan's
widow; so they didn't really cast a vote for a dead candidate over
Aschcroft, Moore just carefully chooses what he wants us to see.So in short, I think this is a great film and I agree that Bush should
be cast out of the White House. But I think that Moore needs to be a
little more honest. He comes out all high and mighty, even judging the
media in the film for what he believes to be them not showing both
sides. How is this showing BOTH sides; there's not ONE positive thing
about the side Moore is against in this whole film. A true journalist
would look at the issues and try and clearly present both sides. Moore
takes both sides, filters them onto the screen the way he wants us to
see his point, adds humor to some pieces and sadness to others, and
there is his movie. And while it is a movie I think is very important and has a strong
message, I just think Moore should let the audience know that these are
his beliefs and not the facts in their entirety. Moore is a great film
maker, but he lacks as a journalist. Maybe that's a good thing though;
because maybe then the film wouldn't be as good as it is.

First, I have to share this (because I'm wondering if it happened
anywhere else): There were *mall security guards* posted inside our
theatre in case of trouble in the audience...and there were actually a
few rowdy people (who obviously did not like what they were seeing on
the screen) who had to be removed!I left the theatre angry...angry because if even one-half of what we
saw during that two hours was true and these idiots are allowed to
remain in office for another four years I swear I'm moving to Canada
the day after the election. I've read both Clarke's and O'Neill's
accounts of their experiences with this current government, and I had
no reason to doubt that *both* of these two intelligent long-time
government employees would out-and-out lie and tell the same stories
just to sell their books. Obviously much of the video and interview
material we saw bore out that what they wrote was true.I left the theatre energized...energized because I'm determined to work
every day between now and the first Tuesday of November to make sure
the people we saw on that movie screen do not have a job after January
20th.Last night I saw a critic complain that the movie was not "objective".
Well, duh! Someone on the panel with him pointed out that in order to
effectively combat idiots like Rush and Michael Reagan in the media the
other side finally realized that you don't fight with knives when the
other side is fighting with guns. Yes, that's a bad pun off of "Bowling
with Columbine" I know...but the point is still a valid one.I agree that this movie will probably win every other major award of
the year, including the Oscars. Kudos if it does. What I (and I suspect
most of you reading this board) care more about is that this movie will
help us sweep the garbage out of Washington in November. I'm not naive
enough to think that any politician is perfect or will be 100% honest
with us...but ANYTHING has to be better than what we have there now.

Whether you love this movie or you hate it, every single person has to
admit one thing: it makes you think. It could make you think about
wringing the necks of the big man in the White House, or doing the same
thing to Michael Moore. It could make you debate for or against this
movie's ideals, or it could introduce you to an entirely new idea that
you have to think about for a while. So, I guess what I'm trying to say
is that my opinion on this movie, although being one of admiration, is
not why I suggest you see this movie. I do suggest this movie because
"Farenheit 9/11" will make you do exactly what a good documentary about
a political quagmire is supposed to do: make you think. And I have
never witnessed a film that has done this job so well, and for that, I
give this movie a 10 out of 10, and propose that all of America see
this movie. Just remember not to get caught up in whether you agree or
disagree with Michael Moore's beliefs, or those portrayed by this film.
Simply see it in order to think. It's good to have a movie these days
that can do that, when so many films can't even structure a theme.

I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last night. It was very powerful. As usual
Michael Moore is very biased. It is by no means an objective
documentary nor should it be. After all, there is no such thing as
Truly objective news, as Moore shows us in the film. Just compare CNN
and Al Jazira or the New York Times and London Times for that matter.
The film was very powerful and pulled on a lot of emotional strings. In
a way it was very manipulative, but in a good way (in my opinion), and
not any more so than how the American public has been manipulated in
recent years into a heightened state of fear and paranoia and deceived
into an unjust war (weapons of mass destruction, where are they?).I definitely recommend seeing this film no matter what your opinion on
Bush and the war is. It is important to be informed and this film is a
great counter point to the biased media we see everyday. If you support
Bush be prepared for some serious and humorous Bush bashing, but keep
in mind that you guys did the same thing to Clinton a few years back.The greatest underutilized freedoms that we have in America are the
freedoms of speech, expression, and opinion. So you can't criticize
Michael Moore as anti-American for making this film. And if we chose to
stifle people like Michael Moore and those who agree with him by
calling them anti-American then we are denying them the very freedoms
that we purport to be bringing to the Iraqi people.See the film, get as much information as you can, make a decision, and
do something about it...VOTE 2004That is what this film is really about.

It was refreshing to see (and hear) that I have not been alone in my
feelings about George W. Bush, his administration and this awful war.
The howls of laughter, and the unabashed applause at the end of this
film showed that those feelings I (and many other Americans) have had
since Bush took office are not isolated. The Republican machine, since
it's crush of President Bill Clinton, has been relentless, nee, vicious
in it silencing of any opposition, and that silencing has been hidden
under the guise of "patriotism". Perhaps the tide has turned, and I for
one, could not be happier. While I don't believe with every point that
Michael Moore raises, I do agree with 85-90% of his assertions.
Republicans and their minions will scream bloody murder, but frankly, I
don't care. Go get 'em Moore. You're my hero.

To be honest and up front i am a liberal democrat and I think BushCo is
the worst thing that ever happened to America. I will try to keep that
opinion out of this review. I do not know if it hits New Yorkers harder
or not, but i know i started to cry during the 9/11 scenes in this
film, which only stopped as my anger increased. What i find amazing is how many people say this film is slanted, as if
that was a bad thing. People - art is to express opinions. A film w/out
a point of view is a boring exercise in mental masturbation. This film
is clearly an opinion piece - which is as it should be. That being
said, it expresses its opinion in a mostly clear and concise manner -
there are a few spots where it loses focus and wanders a bit, but
overall it is sharp edged and cuts true. I used to teach video
documentary editing, and i told my students "every edit is an opinion."
This applies to Micheal Moore, CNN, and Fox news equally. Expressing
opinions freely is exactly what America is about. to deny someone a
forum to express an opinion is patently un-American. Free speech Laws
are there to protect unpopular speech ( popular thought needs no
protection.) See this movie. Try to go with an open mind. Try to come out of theater
in anything other than sadness and rage. Agree or disagree, but see
this film.

I laughed, I cried, I laughed, and I left the theater drained, p*ssed
off at my government. I ached for the victims of 9/11, the families of
the dead soldiers, the families of dead innocent Iraqis, and the ones
in the hospital missing hands and legs. Bush says "Support Our Troops"
and even he doesn't, trying to cut their pay and benefits. Many books
have been written of the hypocrisy of the Administration, but the
average American is too lazy to read a book to learn of the screwing we
are getting. If you won't take two days to read a book, at least take
two hours to see this movie.I was a conscientious objector from the Vietnam War for the same reason
soldiers said they will not go back or cannot understand why we are
there, and my wife lost her high school sweetheart in Vietnam. She may
not be able to handle the crying wives, sisters, mothers, and fathers
now, 40 years later. Unlike those weasels Cheney (who said he had
"other priorities") and Bush (who was AWOL from the NG), I was up front
about my opposition to dirty wars that do not threaten America. I would
take up arms to defend my country, but not kill people not threatening
us. This is "Operation Iraqi Freedom," aka "Operation War
Profiteering."I only wish Republicans had the guts to show up and watch this movie.
This is Moore's best work yet, and it will be hard to beat. No wonder
Eisner and Disney chickened out.Dissent is patriotic. If you care about what has been done to us as a
country and our standing in the world, you have to see this movie. Hate
it if you want, but you have to see it to be informed. And don't give
me any crap about "our soldiers fighting for Moore's right to speak."
That was World War II, not this dirty war. Our soldiers are fighting
this war based on a lie and financial motive; nothing more, nothing
less. And they are dying everyday, and for what? George Bush's and Dick
Cheney's political and personal aggrandizement?

Forget that Michael Moore is a pompous ass that has always had the 'I'm
right, you're wrong' mentality. Forget the fact that the director is
coming off an Academy Award winning helm of the oft talked Bowling for
Columbine, and forget about Fahrenheit 9/11 winning top prize at the
Cannes Film Festival and getting a standing ovation for anywhere from 5
minutes to 6 hours depending on the magazine you read. Forget
everything you have heard about Fahrenheit 9/11.That is about the only advice I can give before you invest time and
money to see Michael Moore's new film which documents his findings
surrounding that infamous day in American history and the President's
call to war that eventually sent thousands of troops to Afghanistan and
Iraq. Simply put, this movie will probably have the best affect on you
if you just sit back and have him show one side of an argument without
any preconceived notions or expectations as an audience.For those of you who have not been up on the hype, Fahrenheit 9/11 is
he second film this year after Passion of the Christ, to generate
mounds of interest and controversy before anyone really viewed it.
Earlier, 9/11 was shunned by Disney who owned the distributing rights
to the film through one of their many subsidiaries. For reasons that
also differ from publication to publication, Disney left the film in
limbo until Miramax (owned by Disney), bought the rights off of the
mother ship and set a release date of June 25 in the most theaters ever
to house an opening of a documentary.Reasons for Disney's cold feet have been speculated as everything from
Governor Jeb Bush's links to the White House to the tax breaks that are
given to the Disney empire that were considered threatened if their
name appeared anywhere on the movie's poster.For whatever reason(s), at least good old Harv over at Miramax has
found a phone booth, switched into his costume, and has flown in to
save the day.Now, to say that you are either going to like this film or hate it is
preposterous. Anyone who has any interest whatsoever in this film has
already tipped their hat which way they lean so I don't expect to see
many (any?) Bush/Cheney 2004 election buttons sitting among the
darkened patrons.For those of you that will find themselves in attendance, whatever bias
you may already have against the Bush administration and their agenda
will be heightened to a boiling point (hence the title) and you
undoubtedly be outraged over every chapter that Moore has uncovered. Referring to the Florida election results that landed the presidency
for Bush over democratic opponent Al Gore, 9/11 starts with a voice
over by its director asking, 'Was it all just a dream?' Showing links
George Bush the junior had to everyone who may have had a hand in the
election counting, Moore begins with the first of many conspiracy
theories, some credible, others unbelievable, that he will throw like a
91.1 mile per hour fast ball at his paying audience. Was the election
fixed? Was the war on terrorism set up for corporate benefits only? Are
the ties suggested between the Bush family and the Bin Ladens keeping
America from catching non-public enemy number one? Moore, seemingly has
all the answers.Where Bowling for Columbine was Moore's python of wit, sarcasm and
style, Fahrenheit is his anaconda. Moore goes after the Bush
administration leaving no prisoners and using all of his weight to gain
some incredible access to Senators or war footage that will make you
feel uneasy if not queasy. You will witness a public beheading in Saudi
Arabia, the charred remains of American soldiers strung up in the
street and children victims of the constant bombing by the Allied
forces. Luckily, Moore must have realized the heavy handedness of his topic and
visuals and he uses more humor and verbal quips to keep things on a
more even plain (hearing that John Ashcroft lost an election to a dead
person was by far the funniest revelation). This is not to say that the film doesn't have an emotional impact, but
at least we are not storming the castle with our pitchforks immediately
after the lights come back on in the theatre. But I have to give Mr. Moore his chops. For all the violence and
self-serving humor, this is Moore's most specific and detailed film
yet. We are thrown statistics that stay with us long after the
experience (Bush was on vacation 42% of the time leading up to the
September 11 attacks. There are more policemen in Manhattan than were
sent to Afghanistan after Bush's pledge to go all out to bring Bin
Laden to justice). These numbers will linger and no doubt affect those
people who have viewed the film on Election Day. I am no closer to understanding how this film won the Golden Palm award
at Cannes as I am at Moore's comment on screen that America is a 'great
country'. It just seemed strange and forced from a man who has ripped
major corporations, the government and the school system in his
selected filmography. A good film, this is the third that Moore has
drank gasoline and p*ssed on the hot topic campfire, and like him or
hate him, he would still be one of the most engaging and interesting
dinner guests that you could ever have to spicy up the appetizer
conversation.

This movie was excellent. I loved it and was not disappointed at all.
But I digress. Now, I can talk all day about why this movie is right or
wrong and I can understand if people hate the movie. But please, if you
liked (or even hated) "9/11", go see "Bowling for Columbine" and go see
"The Big One".Seeing these previous Moore documentaries will strengthen your feelings
of agreement, or disagreement for the points Moore brings up with his
films. Whether a Republican, Democrat, or Independent, everyone should
see this movie. However, do not see it to find out how you must feel,
but do it to be able to decide based on the facts (not to say there
isn't a lot of opinion in the movie) whether Bush deserves a second
term (and maybe his first elected term).

If you haven't already done so, run, do not walk to the nearest theatre
that is showing this extraordinary film. For those of us who've been
paying attention for the last few years, there was not a lot of new
information in this movie. But seeing it all together with the
commentary and juxtapositioning of the visuals made it a very effective
film.Seeing in detail the people who are running this country (beginning
with their selection, not election) is chilling. I'm not surprised how
angry the film made me; I am surprised at how sad it made me. It's an
intense, sometimes funny and always powerful film.

After opening with Election Night 2000 and its aftermath, Moore details
ties among the Bush family, principals in both Bush administrations,
various Saudi royals, the bin Laden family, the Taliban and other
recent global players. He questions whether those relationships and
interests may have influenced key decisions before and since 9/11 to
our collective detriment.Regardless of one's political leanings, in many respects, this is
Moore's best documentary yet. The topics and treatment are too crucial
for you to rely on the opinions of others, including mine. No
commentator can honestly claim objectivity (or to be 'fair and
balanced') on this hot potato.Fahrenheit 9/11 approximates for politics and world events the
polarizing potential of The Passion of the Christ in the religious
realm. As with that other movie, those who agree with the film-maker
will find compelling support for their views. Opponents will scream
foul. Both will have some valid points. Those on the fence will likely
shift their weight at least somewhat to one side or the other.Here's the best I can do to set aside the bluster you'll get elsewhere,
and focus on the actual two hours of content:In the early going, Moore spends considerable time showing the
long-standing, large-dollar history among the two Presidents Bush and
Saudi investors, from before GHWB took office, and ever since. He
mentions political and financial maneuvers involving GWB with oil and
energy companies (Harken and others) before he was Governor of Texas,
through the very recent Carlyle Group role of GHWB after his
presidency, through the red-carpet treatment given to Taliban leaders
on a visit to Texas earlier in 2001, while trying to negotiate a
pipeline deal through Afghanistan. Halliburton and Enron get a little
mention, too.Moore asks whether this extensive history, which adds up to $1.4
billion of Saudi investment in Bush-related businesses over the last
three decades may have unduly influenced the decision to let 142 Saudis
(including 24 relatives of Osama) fly home from the US in the days
after 9/11, while all other civilian flights were grounded? Moore
covers the strong sentiment among many current Bush officials to oust
Saddam years before 9/11. Might these entanglements and old agendas
have unduly influenced White House policies and decisions on the wisest
deployment of military and other resources against terrorism?Is Moore fair? Arguably, he makes too much of Dubbya's 'vacation' time
at the ranch in the first year of his tenure. His critique of the
President's actions on the morning of 9/11, entering and remaining in
the Florida grade-school classroom as he learned of the attacks on the
Towers, may seem harsh. Yet, compared to his heavy-handed ridicule of
Charlton Heston near the end of Bowling for Columbine, and his
ill-conceived comments when he accepted the Oscar for it, Moore
resisted 'cheap-shot' tactics more admirably than I'd feared he might.
He's on-camera far less than his norm. He manages a few spots of
much-needed levity. Overall, it's less strident than Al Franken's
latest book, 'Liars...', and much of talk radio fare from either side. Moore finds plenty of other targets, too. He blasts the Democrats -
particularly those in the Senate and Congress - for being spineless,
back to the 2000 election, and throughout the post-9/11 Bush buildup to
Iraq, and the patriot Act. He blames the press for cheer leading,
instead of asking the hard questions, or focusing on the same facts
he's presenting in the film. No one challenged the White House ban on
showing coffins coming home. No one mentions the more than 5,000 troop
injuries, as of the film's final edit. Other than some internal
information that's only come to light recently - like the testimony of
Richard Clarke - all of this was has been out there all along, if
anyone cared (or dared) to look beyond the sound bites. By extension,
if we're deceived and damaged by our leaders and the media, we all
share in the blame for not demanding more from them. Moore turns from his direct exposure of those at the top to more
familiar territory. Throughout his career, despite any inconsistencies
or incongruities one may find in his positions, he retains the voice of
a grassroots guy. Despite celebrity and success, he's still a rumpled,
overweight blue-collar guy from Flint, Michigan, railing against the
financial and political forces that closed local factories, devastating
proud, solid middle-class families, and turning his home town into a
slum. Flint and the auto industry are not the only victims of
downsizing, outsourcing and all those sanitized terms for the rich
getting richer; the poor, poorer; and the middle-class going the way of
the dinosaur.Most of the last half of the film highlights the intimate, human side
of war. Which families' loved ones get shipped overseas? Who bears the
brunt of their deaths and injuries? Without a draft, those who support,
or profit most, from war are least likely to see their children in the
line of fire. Only one of our 535 Senators and Representatives has a
son or daughter among the ranks of enlisted personnel in the Middle
East. When ambushed on the sidewalk by Moore with military recruiting
pamphlets for their kids, none of the Congresspersons he found were
exactly receptive.Extending one of his stronger points from Columbine, Moore again rails
against manipulation of the populace through fear. In that case, it was
primarily weapons-related interests selling personal protection through
paranoia. Here it's political and industrial Haves, keeping us as
fearful as necessary to sustain dependency on their purportedly
superior ability to protect us. The extended display of grief among various citizens speaks against all
wars, even as Moore's narration acknowledges its inevitability. He
finally asks that those who actually make the biggest sacrifices only
be called upon to do so for the right reasons, based on truth from
those we trust to lead our nation and its people.Gee. How radical is that?

You may love Fahrenheit 9/11 or hate it, but when you come out of the
theater you won't be feeling neutral.Here's the question: Has George W. Bush been doing a good job of
fighting terror? Anyone who gets livid at the suggestion that the
answer might be "No" (even if it's true) should definitely avoid this
film; it will only raise their blood pressure, and might trigger a
medical emergency. For everyone who isn't a fanatic, though, I would
recommend it without reservation. It's not balanced; it doesn't pretend to be. This is as much the
unabashed case for "No," as Fox News is the case for "Yes". Well, no,
it's better than Fox, because every component of it is true; unlike
Fox, Moore has been scrupulously careful to verify all the facts he
includes. For people who have been paying close attention over the past
three and a half years, there won't be many surprises, but much of what
he covers has been allowed to drift under the media radar.But even if you knew all the facts, it's a gripping ride, with never a
dull instant. It's different, once you see it all together. Moore uses
humor deftly -- to make a point, and to make sure you don't overload on
the horrors of war or the wrenching grief, and zone out. The impact of
the stuff that makes you cry is all the greater because you were
laughing just a moment ago. (Shakespeare knew this, which is why the
Porter is in Macbeth.) The film is worth seeing, especially, for the
vivid, sympathetic, three-dimensional portrait it gives of American
troops serving in Iraq.In sum: I am certainly going to see this one again.

If Bush won't do it...who will? Moore! Michael Moore has done what
George W. Bush will not, and that is tell the truth. That's all we ask
for and Mr. Moore has put beautifully and honestly into film what the
rest of us can't say in words. If the white house won't listen to us
then this film will certainly speak its mind. There are many powerful
points in the film that most people are unaware of and I'm happy that
everything is cleared up (or at least the questions have arisen) BEFORE
election day! I've never been one to support stereotypes, so I don't believe that we
should trust this man simply because he is the president. We have a
right to know who our leader is, where he came from and what he did
before we blindly follow him into harm's way. Moore has helped our
country see Bush for who he really is so the American people can decide
for themselves if they want to keep destroying innocent lives (and we
all know from 9/11 that it's wrong to destroy innocent lives, which is
what we're doing!) or move away from that. He did not come right out
and say "He's such an idiot..." or "This war is wrong!" but he provided
enough information for us to decide for ourselves. This film will
hopefully give America a shove in the right direction. I have never
heard applause at the end of a film so loud... There were shouts and
whistles and cheering... Fantastic film! This is Kerry's best campaign piece and his name isn't even mentioned!

Just because it is a documentary does not mean it isn't biased. Of
course any documentary is made from the film maker's point of view.
Even when we see a fact, there will always be different views. While
some people may not agree Moore's view, this movie is informative and
very entertaining.But beyond its political views, Michael Moore's movie caused people to
care about issues, this country, the direction of this country, the
government's action and what it means to you. Because of this movie,
people are talking about politics which is, I think, more than any
event or anybody has even done before. I think it's healthy and great
that people care. I don't think most people who watched this movie will
ever simply follow the government or politicians blindly no matter
which side they are. And that's a true Patriot Act on Moore's part.This is a brilliant movie. Big salute to Moore.

Not only is this movie artfully done and entertaining, but it is also
factual. In light of evidence, facts cease to be debatable. That's what
I loved about this movie. It hit you with the truth. Yes, just like
many other documentary-style films, it is quite biased. I have yet to
watch one that wasn't. After seeing Fahrenheit 9/11, I knew I had to
investigate for myself to be sure that I hadn't been effected by a
piece of propaganda. The facts were out there, recorded by credible
sources, backing up the message of the movie. Go see it and then do
some research on your own. I think you'll find that most, if not all,
of Moore's message stands firmly on a foundation of indisputable
information.

I went to this film, prepared to see a polemic, where the political
agenda of the filmmaker overshadowed the art of making a fine film. I
was pleasantly surprised to find that although it was clearly there,
the political agenda was not allowed to in any way detract from the
film as a work of art. This film clearly deserved the top honors it won
at Cannes. Often, it is the role of the artists in a community to rescue a culture
from disasteriously wrong directions. This follows a long, and sacred
tradition, from the ancient Greeks and their playwrights, continuing
through to Picasso's Guernica, including the poetry of Pablo Neruda,
and to some of the finer filmmakers today. With this film, I think
Michael Moore has clearly earned a place in that exclusive club. I only
hope that his art has the much needed affect of waking up the bulk of
U.S. citizens before it is too late, if it is not already.

Fahrenheit 911 is probably the best movie I've seen since Shakespeare
in Love, and probably the most significant story ever captured on
celluloid. If you haven't seen it, make it a top priority.For those of you who don't know what it is, it's Michael Moore's
(Bowling for Columbine) latest non-fiction film. Moore takes dead aim
at the Bush regime and shows how our country has been the victim of a
coup, exposes the Bush family ties to the Saudis (the Bin Laden family
in particular), and clearly shows that the war in Iraq is an immoral
crusade for wealth. While doing this, Moore manages to pull on your
heart strings and knock the funny bone at appropriate moments so that
you are simultaneously entertained and educated.For those of you who are ardent Bush supporters, I challenge you to go
see this movie. Sure, you can quote (what you've heard other's tell you
that they read about what some guy said when he was talking with
someone who overheard) that Moore was taking things out of context.
But, go see it for yourself, and then tell me in what context Bush's
comments and actions could possibly be appropriate.For those of you who aren't yet 18, make your parents help you see it.For those of you responsible for young-adults, aged 13-18, you have a
responsibility to make them watch it.Oh, and for those of you who like forwarding chain letters and the
like, how about we start one that calls for Bush, Cheney and the boys
be turned over to an international war crimes tribunal.

How can you watch F9/11 and not come away feeling as though Michael
Moore has done something wonderful for film; brought documentary into a
new and different realm; and given voice to the sentiments of hundreds
of thousands of people (and thus created a work of art)? Republicans are tearing their hair out about this film because it
contains more than just the seeds of truth. It is a fully mature movie.
All of the complaints that republicans have used thus far to attack the
movie (those who have even seen it) are not significant. They accuse
Moore of everything they can possibly think of, yet all of these
complaints hug the periphery of the film and do not address the content
of the film itself.

The person that attention should be directed to after watching
"Fahrenheit 9/11" is George W. Bush, not Michael Moore. Of all of MMs
documentaries, F9/11 has the least focus on its maker. This is
partially due to a larger budget, but, more importantly, because Bush,
the Bush Administration and Congress are the foci of the film.Factually, the complaints I have heard are specious. I wouldn't know
that Rep. Mark Kennedy (R-MN) appeared in the film except for his
complaint about MM not including his statement that he had a nephew on
active terrorism duty. That wasn't the question, the question was
whether he had a child in the war. It has been said that MM doesn't say
that Senator Johnson has a son on duty, but it is consistently stated
that only one member of Congress has a son or daughter in the service.
The mistatement by Michael Isakoff in "Newsweek" concerning the Saudi
exodus after 9/11 have already been rebutted.Then there are the misstatements about MMs intent. It has been said
that he doesn't think we should have invaded Afghanistan. No, the truth
is just the reverse. MM points out that the Bush administration didn't
want to go into Afghanistan, favoring an attack on Iraq from the start.
Once it was made clear to them that they couldn't ignore the country
that Osama bin-Laden was in, MM points out that the endeavor was
half-hearted and cut back as soon as possible. The point of the happy
Iraqis before the war is to show the destruction that was wreaked on
Iraq, in contradiction to the "surgical strikes" the Bush
administration was propagandizing. Concerning the scenes with American
soldiers during the first days of the war. These soldiers knew who they
told the enemy was, it was Iraqis. That's the dirty little secret being
kept, we went to war against Iraq because American pols wanted a
certain ruling class to take hold, and the Bush administration didn't
think the Iraqi people would do it without a military presense. The
soldiers didn't sound crass or dumb, they sounded focused.The time has passed for all Americans to take the blinders of Pentagon
propaganda off and look at what has been done in our names. Michael
Moore has the courage to pull back the curtain, are you courageous
enough to look?

Many have gotten the idea that Moore has distorted the truth in this
film. The fact is, however, that if you look into many of the subjects
he broaches for yourself, you will find that what he presents is for
the most part accurate. Moreover, in some places, Moore could have gone
much further and backed up his assertions with more facts. Many people
don't realize that in making this type of film, it is difficult to fit
all your support for your assertions in the time allotted, and so Moore
has had to sacrifice depth for breadth in much of the film.Overall, this is a very good film, but there are other films that are
even better. For example, right now "The Corporation" and "Control
Room" are playing in some theaters, and they are absolutely fantastic.

I'm going to try and focus more on the movie than the message it
conveys in this review  I figure the political fight is going to
happen, and after all, this is a site about movies, not politics.
Spoilers included.It is rare to see a documentary of this caliber. The story follows a
loose timeline of recent events building a path through the Bush
presidency. Unlike Bowling for Columbine, Moore is able to reach both
ends of the dramatic spectrum with his use of humor and drama. One
hilarious example was a shotgun clip series from the TV series Dragnet,
where Joe Friday is questioning family members of a suspect. Moore
starts the segment talking to a former FBI agent about why the Bin
Laden family members in the US were allowed to leave without being
questioned. When video clips of Dragnet started, the entire theater
burst out laughing. This use of comedy helped the audience feel the
crushing impact of the fall when a few images of the horror of the war
in Iraq were shown minutes later. This emotional roller-coaster is often
the desired effect of modern dramas, but is nearly never achieved in a
documentary.In addition to the story's flow, the soundtrack was particularly
poignant. Much of the 'filler' music was original material, but the
songs Moore choose for key theme changes were perfect. For example,
when certain dignitaries and members of the Bin Laden family were
allowed to exit the country, the footage was set to the song 'We got to
get out of this place,' by the Animals. Classic, and effective.The war images were very graphic, but appropriate. Moore's ability to
ride the fine line between not showing enough horror to tell the story
and desensitizing the audience is again perfect. He's able to use
imagery effectively, quickly building empathy for the fallen. All in
all, I would estimate less than 2:00 minutes of the total movie were
too graphic for prime time TV.Although this documentary has become more about political motivation
than film, its still important for us to remember it's a work of art
first. Whether you agree or disagree with the message, the film itself
is a true classic  well worth the time and money to see. 9.5/10

As much as the "left-leaning" CNN will attempt to chop this picture
down, Fahrenheit 9/11 exposes the underpinnings of the current
administration in Washington. Saudi money over American lives, whether
those lives are lost overseas or falling to the ground as the World
Trade Center was razed to the ground. The American machine will keep
rolling as long as impoverished people find employment in the United
States military, just so ignorant Americans don't have to sacrifice
anything other than their personal freedoms: freedoms they believe are
worth sacrificing in order to create the image of a safe society. Remember a time where the US government would impose a fee on those who
wanted to buy their way out of service to their country? Get ready to
live that memory, Americans. To the young Americans, exercise your
right to vote while you still have freedoms to hold on to, because it

I just got back from the 10:15 p.m. showing of Fahrenheit 9/11 at the
local 24 theater AMC. I was well aware of the content in the film but
went in with an open mind hoping to be informed of issues in which my
knowledge is rather lacking. For such a late showing, and considering
we had arrived a half hour early, there was a long line of people
waiting to be let into the theater for Fahrenheit. I won't say much
about the film itself except for you pretty much have to see it
yourself, and that it provided me with what I had expected from it. The
people that nearly completely filled the theater seats offered many
reactions to several parts of the movie including several laughs,
clapping (especially at the part in which Tom Ashcroft was said to have
lost in the Missouri election to the deceased Carnahan, as I expect
many people in the audience voted in that election), tears, and finally
much applause at the credits. As I left the theater I was surprised to see a lady passing out flyers
to people leaving the film advertising a "Turn Up the Heat: A National
Town Meeting", an online town meeting with Michael Moore on June 28th.
The flyer also mentioned meeting like minded people in the community
along with an intensive voter registration and education drive. In closing I think this film should be viewed by any American, bush
haters and supporters alike, and anybody who values freedom and honest
in the USA.

Say what you will of Micheal Moore. Yes, he does sometimes invade the
privacy of others to gain specific reactions for his films, and yes, he
probably wouldn't enjoy anyone doing that to him. He can be a jerk, but
this jerk can make one heckuva film. Moore proves in this film more than ever, his talents not just as a
rabble-rouser, but as a filmmaker. He masterfully uses seemingly
endless interview and archive footage to go beyond just documenting,
but into the realm of story telling; with prologue, a bookends effect,
a cast of players, character development, conflict, etc. It is a very
poetic film at best, with the ability to gain every intended reaction;
at times, the audience was laughing one moment and crying the next. Film-making aside, it is hard to decide how much Moore indulges the
audience with footage that is taken out of context. Especially in his
depictions of the white house staff, Moore may have over exaggerated
many of the things he used from archive footage. Regardless over how
unfair or what bias for which Moore has been criticized, the arguments
are futile against: 1. his undeniable freedom to make any film he wants
just as any director would, and 2. the power of the evidence he has in
this film. Unlike past films, nearly every argument Moore presents is
backed up with actual documents and, most powerfully, video footage
(especially that out of Iraq).So he's done it again, but this time it's more relevant, more powerful,
and more entertaining than ever. Regardless of personal politics,
everyone should see this film; if not to be enlightened by many of the
facts presented, but to simply debate their view afterward. We all have
a right to our opinions, thank god Moore exercises his.

45% of America is going to say right on Mr. Moore and 45% will say what
a piece of crap. I am a die hard Democrat but know that Moore doesn't
take a trip anywhere unless he can only turn left to get there. After
watching Bowling for Colombine I looked into some of the things he said
and discovered that twisting and stretching the truth is not only
something he accuses the right of doing but something he does himself
from time to time. The tone of this movie is dead on and the majority
of misinformed Americans would be shocked to see some undisputed facts
of the movie and catch just a small glimpse of why more people than
ever world wide hate us and why it is now easier than ever for some
groups to recruit the poorest of the poor to die fighting us. By tone I
mean the "look at the left hand and never mind what the right is
doing,' ulterior motives pressing forth the personal agenda of this
administration from top to bottom. No President was ever or will ever
be perfect and make everyone happy but what they do they do in our name
and at the end of the day people die because of the decisions they make
and we have to believe they are dieing for the right reasons or we take
a step closer to being more like what we are fighting to stop. Watch
this movie and question the things we all just assumed were the right
reasons before the war and decide for yourself come election time. 8

I thought that Moore's movie showed the truth about the corruption in
our government. Moore is quite a facts man, and I love how he backs all
of what he says with documented evidence. The images from the film were
astute and not overdone, and overall, I found the film informative,
humorous without being glib, and thought provoking. Also, Moore always
finds a way to shove the facts back at his target, and the scene where
he asks the Senators to enroll their own children in the army was
superbly done. Just the looks the Senators' faces said all that was
needed. And those marine recruiters! They were like used car salesmen:
selling their ideals with lies. The only question that I would have
would be if the Bush administration will address any of these
questions. Hopefully, when people see this movie, it will move some of
the sluggish "my vote doesn't matter" people into taking a stand.

First let me say how interesting it is that this movie wasn't shown in
2 main theaters in my town, which usually have every movie that comes
out. Yes, people know it's the truth, and they are afraid. Now... this
is an amazing movie, pure and simple. It is a masterpiece documentary
that everybody should see. This film shows nothing but the truth about
who the American government is, and it goes into details with nothing
but facts. It covers everything from Bush and 9/11 to Afghanistan and
Iraq. I didn't learn much from this movie that I didn't already know,
but it served as a great reminder. I'd like to thank Mr. Moore for
being so brave and creating this movie. I'd also advise him to be very
careful now and stay safe. Advice for everyone else: go see Fahrenheit
9/11 now. 10 out of 10. I would give it more but I can't.

This movie is a must see. I strongly encourage all republicans to go
see this movie, in fact I challenge you to see this movie and walk out
of the theatre still pro Bush. If you're a true conservative, you would
except my challenge. This movie is amazing, there was a standing ovation in the theater once
it was over. It was amazingly compiled, and didn't even focus on some
of the major faults of George W. Bush, only the ones that are a result
of 9/11. Michael Moore isn't as narcissistic in this one as in the last
one. He has an amazing narrative and...SPOILERS (not really I just don't wanna get busted)When he gives that guys phone number away I laughed so hard and
clapped.awesome movie!!!!

I am a big fan of Michale Moore and not because he brings news to us
which the mainstream media so very diligently hides, in a form of a
great documentary. But because he helps us connect the dots, the news
articles which we read and ignore, thinking its some kind of Bush or
Republican bashing. 911 again shows that our soldier are dying in Iraq in vain, innocent
civilians are being killed, for what? Oil? And for profit of companies
that George Bush, his father and Dick Cheney hold a big share of.This movie is an eye opener for those conservatives who still believe
in Bush. This movie and Michael Moore's other movies all have solid
references to the source of the facts, news and statements. Not a
single fact is made up.Apart from what this movie addressed and would probably help throw Bush
out of White House. It brings home the point that government of our
country is as good as us people. In 911, Bush is heard saying "Fool me
once Shame on you, Fool me again Shame on me". So we have been fooled
not again, only this time it was not Vietnam or Desert Storm. It was a
plan meticulously executed, with drumbeat of Al-Qaeda and WMDs, to
satisfy the greedy corporates with Bush connections and without. I think it did not address why American Democracy has been providing
choice of only two parties for the last 4 decades. Why do we Americans
donot raise voice to revamp the Federal Election Commision and most
importantly the Presidential Debate Commission (PDC)? I think it is the
FEC and PDC combined with Electoral College system that is the root of
all problems, limiting our choice to elect. Just like Carlyle,
Halliburton and Unocal the PDC is a private body which influences
American mindset.I hope Michael Moore will make a movie which hits to the very core of
our wrongly practiced Democracy.

Moore hits at the Bush agenda with the Moore perspective. Moore is
deeper, far more articulate than the Bushies. Moore has some major
points to score for the side of democracy and against lopsided rule of
the Republicans and their freedom for all those who can afford it.
Moore's job IS a real job. He necessary to society. Bush turns out to
be a destructive, selfish figure who's never had an honest job in his
life. Moore might well convince many that Bush is a war criminal. If
Bush had ever had a real job maybe he wouldn't have got into this
trouble. This picture is not just your average documentary. It has more
drama and laughs than a lot of features. It also appears to be a social
phenomenon. I will only describe the scene at the theater as
packed--and the people, after the show, very concerned. Oh, and Moore
has a way of lightening up--surprising given that the material can be
heavy. You are denying yourself an opportunity to be an informed
citizen if for some irrational reason you decide not to see this movie
and see what everybody's squawking about.

I thought this movie would be a over zealous slant against bush, but
it's a middle slight to the left film. It just shows him doing what he
does, and catching him at a number of lies. Moore does what journalist
are supposed to do - report events! It was a whole lot funnier than I thought. It think it's so important
every US citizen see how we have abandoned our own dead and wounded
solders. (Where's their movies and news updates?) Also, the news tells
us were only hitting civilians, but when they are holding a dead child
one get's a better sense of the brutality that is this war.Anyway, I strongly encourage everyone who will ever vote to see this
movie.

I must admit that I am proud to have men like Michael Moore as my
fellow Americans. He speaks up, while most of us either hide in the
ostrich position or are just plain ignorant on what is going on is the
world. We are constantly being fed by the media with one-sided stories
and that is is patriotic to support and stand behind all the evil
doings of this country. Peace is patriotic too! It is easy to become
politic after watching this well made documentary. It made me cry, it
made me laugh, It made me shake my head in disbelief. A documentary
that rocked my world. Critics are still going to trash it for Moore's
subjectivity, but hey now, he certainly knows how to stir things up and
possibly change the future? How long are we going to search for a
terrorist behind every bush? Would a man of integrity, please stand up
and become our new leader?

"I'm not fair" proclaimed "Fahrenheit 9/11" director and writer Michael
Moore last night on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show." Moore, the
infant terrible of documentarians told host Jon Stewart that he had an
agenda (moviegoers never would have guessed) and that his facts are
clear with their interpretation an open field.Moore probably believes this but many of his facts in this powerful but
flawed documentary aren't so crystal clear and neither are they
necessarily proven. Moore wants to see Bush defeated in November and as
a documentarian with a cause he follows in a fairly long line of
film-makers who, subtly or otherwise, have an agenda dear to their
hearts. No one will ever denounce Moore for subtlety."Fahrenheit 9/11" may be one of the only films I've ever seen where the
audience - most of them - began prolonged cheering when the director's
name appeared in the OPENING sign boards. That reflected, of course,
the political leaning of an affluent Westchester audience that was
all-white and which filled surrounding parking lots with SUVs and
luxury cars (my Honda Civic a small disgrace).Moore opens the film with a creative look at the Twin Towers tragedy.
Rather than showing yet again the planes knifing into the buildings and
their tortuous collapse, he uses sounds from Ground Zero with a blank
screen which then segues to the horrified and occasionally hysterical
visages of people on the street. We don't have to see the
collapse-Moore correctly knows that what he's done is to rip loose
indelible, horrific memories that supply what isn't on the screen. From there he goes to THE election as seen from both Florida and later
in a joint congressional section where black representatives, one after
the other, forlornly or bitterly demand the investigation into Florida
fraud that can only take place with at least one's senator's
acquiescence. No senator gives his or her signature and the scene
bespeaks yet another betrayal of minorities, here at a crucial time in
a hallowed place.Much of what follows is a demonstration of what even many Bush
supporters can't avoid admitting - he's a mental lightweight, a fool
and a clown but a man who through family contacts (especially 41's)
with both American industry and the Saudi Arabian oligarchy is one rich
fool. And his family's involvement with Saudi Arabian magnates who have
invested billions in the U.S. is well presented and will be hard to
refute.Many scenes that follow are readily familiar-Bush the very experienced
and dedicated vacationer, Bush reading a children's book in a Florida
school on 9/11 for seven long minutes after an aide whispered in his
ear that the second tower had been hit and America was under attack.
Apologists will trot out the usual vapid excuses for Bush's indifferent
attitude and lackadaisical unrolling of short (and occasionally
unintelligible) sound bites while the nation desperately needed real
leadership both after 9/11 and during a war that seems to offer no
likelihood of victory and even less of disengagement.The war in Iraq gets much play with combat scenes and footage of grisly
dead and wounded, some from Al Jazeera with a few shots also prominent
in the currently running "Control Room."Soldiers and family members are interviewed. Some troops are troubled
by the war, others are repelled morally and politically. For other
soldiers the war is an adventure, a chance to prove their mettle and
the value of their training (these troops haven't been wounded yet).
Family members are either arch-patriotic and supportive or they are
riven with tears as they recount the loss of a loved one. A broken
mother's account of learning of her son's death in combat by telephone
from the Defense Department is heartbreaking: audience members were
crying. (What happened to the claim that all such notifications are
done in person by uniformed personnel? An economy taken as the casualty
list increases?).While Moore makes the argument that the war's true purpose is to
advance American business interests (Halliburton comes in for some
well-deserved hits) and the military, especially its young members, are
fodder for the plutocrats, the case isn't well advanced by showing
scenes regularly screened in news reports and specials. It's Hidden
Agenda Analysis Lite.What is both surprising and unexpected is the degree to which Moore,
the sole interviewer, is unusually invisible, his typical
attention-grabbing shenanigans at a minimum. In one episode he
commandeers a Mister Frostie truck to drive around the Capitol reading
the USA Patriot Act to members of Congress over the loudspeaker, some
of whom admit on screen that they don't read the bills they vote for.
This isn't news but when it's in reference to the very troubling,
hastily put together and deeply flawed USA Patriot Act it's a reminder
of how much power this administration sought and received with little
careful legislative scrutiny. Almost none, in fact.Sillier and very irrelevant is vintage Moore waylaying members of
Congress and offering recruiting literature while urging them to have
their kids enlist. Enlisting or not is a personal decision-in our time
it's no longer reasonable to arraign any parent on the charge that
he/she has forsaken a patriotic duty to urge military service to their
kids. TV coverage of Vietnam started to put paid to that. I'm reminded
of that grand World War II patriotic song, "I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be
a Bomb."Moore isn't just putting out a documentary-he's urging involvement by
sympathetic viewers to defeat Bush and he has a website and a scheduled
online Town Meeting to advance his goal. That's his privilege. Make no
doubt about it: despite what some hysterical anti-Moore people are
saying "Fahrenheit 911" is very much in the tradition of film,
documentary or feature, aimed at motivating viewers to demand or make
change.I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11"at the Jacob Burns Film Center dead set in the
center of a constellation of very well-off Westchester, NY communities.
Tomorrow I'll be back in Manhattan and I want to see the film in a less
anti-Bush neighborhood (yeah, I'd prefer a second viewing in the South
or rural Midwest but I can't find the time to fly around just to see
Moore's movie again).Moore's movie is very important because his deep passion goes beyond
the self-promotion central to his previous films. He's a zealot with
regard to Bush and Iraq. That makes him both a fierce documentarian and
a lightning rod for attack. How or if "Fahrenheit 9/11" will sway
voters, especially those not committed to one side or the other,
remains to be seen. What is certain is that Moore's fevered creation is
a political milestone in documentary films.10/10

Anyone who refuses to see this film is a willfully ignorant coward. I
believe it is irresponsible to ignore or write off this desperately relevant
political film as left wing propaganda. While Michael Moore is notorious for
presenting the facts in a light best suited to furthering his political
ideals, it should be pointed out that his side is one that should be at the
very least taken into consideration. While I have been aware of many of the
more negative aspects of the Bush administration over the past 4 years, I
gained an entirely different perspective seeing it all boiled down to 112
minutes. If anyone is considering voting for Bush or knows someone who is,
make sure to see this film first.

A man has two reasons for everything he does, a good one, and the real one.
We know that all of Dubya's good reasons are lies or simply false. When we
try to discern the real reason, there are only a few possibilities. Moore
hints at a number of real reasons -- the alleged assassination attempt on
GHW Bush, Wolfowitz's desire to use U.S. power for Israel's benefit, and
several others. Moore focuses on the enormous amount of money the Saudi
royals have sent Dubya's way, and the lucrative opportunities that war
offers Halliburton and other Bush friends. I have to think, though, that the
financial benefits of the war are just a happy coincidence for Dubya and his
friends. The real reason still eludes Moore and us.

I knew going into this film that Moore was going to go about trying to make
George W. Bush look bad. However, as you watch this film, it is not Moore
trying to make Bush look bad, it is Bush making himself look bad. This is
scary! Nobody thought Bush was a genius or great leader when he became
President, but few knew how far from those characteristics he really was.
This is a man that hears from an aide that we have just had war declared on
us by terrorists and what does he do? He sits there reading a kid's book!
What!? Then he jumps into Air Force One and is not heard from for sometime.
However, he does find time to show up at the WTC wreckage and give one of
the most shameless pep rallys in human history. Only made more disgraceful
by the fact that thousands of dead bodies still remained buried underneath
the wreckage he was shamelessly standing over. This is a President that had
been on vacation for four of the first eight months of his term.
Translation, while the terrorists plotted, Dubya was off playing golf. He
never had one meeting over terrorism before 9/11. However, Clinton had
weekly meetings over terrorism while he was President. He even tried to warn
Bush about Bin Laden when power was transferred. But the frat boy son of a
President did not care to listen. No, Mr. Moore did not open my eyes to what
a bad President George W. Bush has been, George W. Bush opened up my eyes!

The only problem is that most of the time it was from laughing. Once you get
past how ridiculous all the information you've taken in is, it's all you can
do to not become angry. This documentary does what it should. It makes you
question everything you hear from your government and your media, which I
think some of us haven't done for a long time, at our own peril.**spoilers**As a film I thought it was pretty much perfect. I especially appreciate the
use of music in the film. From the GoGos to Neil Young, I thought it was
fantastic and one particular highlight for me was the use of the theme song
from "The Greatest American Hero". I don't know if everyone else in my
theater caught the reference. Michael Moore has done a fantastic job here.
The way it was edited kept up a good pace and didn't bore you like
documentaries often can, and I didn't feel like his message was too
overdone. I think some things that others may consider over the top like the
scenes of Iraqi children playing just before the city is bombed is something
people need to see, no matter how heavy handed because people somehow don't
put two and two together, that innocent people die in war. They know it deep
down, but without seeing it they can ignore it. Also some graphic scenes I
think were necessary as we don't see those kind of images of war on the
nighttime news, which again allows people to remain as ignorant as they want
to be. Whether you agree with his politics or not, he's a truth seeker and
we need more of those. He's presenting the truth as he sees it and to me
that's the purpose of art. And this work of art brought to us by a true
American hero gets a 10/10 from me. Take as many people as you can to this
thought-provoking eye-opener. You don't have to like it, just watch it and
decide for yourself.

If you look at the ratings for this here on IMDB, you will see it is rated
only 6.4.  It would be 9.4, except the right has a lot of people voting it
as a 1 - the lowest possible, as part off their effort to dissuade people
from getting the straight dope about the crooks at the top. How many
Republicans are we going to elect that trample the Constitution and the Bill
of Rights, and try to turn the planet into PLANTATION EARTH?  Nixon
(Watergate), Reagan (IranGate and the October Surprise), Bush I (the "I was
out of the loop", liar and former CIA chief who was not consulted about
clandestine affairs - yeah right - about his involvement in IranGate), and
now this current village idiot, who is the cream of the crop.   In this
crop, it appears the cream has risen to the bottom, if Moore is correct -
and all the news people tell us these facts have been known since forever. 
Well, why didn't they tell US, the public?  This is the movie the Right is
Wrong about!  This is a MOST Excellent Movie!!!!  Michael Moore is
everyone's hero - except the Political Right.  Moore calls a spade a spade,
a crook a crook (where was he when Nixon was trying to be DUbya's
forerunner?), and corruption corruption.  He has the gonads we all wish we
had.  Thank God - in all his forms, and by all of his names - for Michael
Moore's Dad's glint in his eye the night Michael was conceived.  We who have
been raped and plundered (is their anyone on the planet that hasn't?) by the
oil interests have been done a big favor.  Oil, personified by this corrupt
Bush family that makes Nixon look like a piker, may yet get its comeuppance.

This film presents a shocking and spectacular series of facts which prove
unequivocably that the Bush administration has ridden the backs of the poor
and middle class in America in order to line their pockets.I challenge anyone to sit through this film without weeping.  This was the
biggest surprise of this film - it shows real human lives which have been
trampled on by the Bush administration... and it shows a great deal of film
footage which was never shown by America's media for fear that Americans
might start questioning the wisdom of a war in Iraq.  Even more surprising
are the shocking footage of Bush giving Taliban officials a tour of Texas
when he was Governor of Texas, and Bush giving privileges to Saudi Arabians
that he couldn't even give to his own mother.  You start to see a pattern of
deception here...Michael Moore has pieced together the most brilliant documentary film ever
made in "Fahrenheit 9/11."  Bush administration folks are working overtime
to try to discredit Michael Moore, who is more like a real Christian saint
than anyone they will ever meet, but it won't work.  They tried to ban this
movie from America.  Thank God they failed.  This film is ESSENTIAL viewing
for every American.  ESSENTIAL viewing.

Can we please make a new rule here at IMDB? It's a rule of honoralone. You can NOT give a rating to any movie you have NOTactually seen. Is this too much to ask? I don't care if you don't likeMichael Moore. I don't care if you are a flaming conservative. Youshould not rate this movie unless you have seen it. It's not fair toany movie to rate it if you haven't seen it. Hey, maybe if some of youirrational, unfair people went out and actually watched the movie,you might see that it is actually very intelligent and rational andmight realize that it in no way deserves a "0." I am telling you that ifa Republican Propaganda film came out, glorifying the presidencyof George W. Bush, I would not give it a "0" merely because I thinkhe's a horrible president. The only way I would give it a rating at all,is if I went out and watched it and then formed an opinion aboutthe actual movie. Let's be fair, people! Don't rate movies youhaven't seen!

Everyone should see this movie, but not for the reasons you might think. 
The first half of the movie is basically hilarious, almost to the point that
one might suggest Michael Moore should be making pure comedies using
archival footage and setting it to music as he does brilliantly many times
in this film.  Then the humor starts to fade away and the propagandizing
starts as well as the exploitation, sensationalism, and way over the top
sentimentality.  This is where I felt the wheels sort of came off and the
film started to loose some of its established credibility.One of the best things about documentary is its ability to uncover history
unknown to most people and even at times unknown to everyone.  There is some
of this in this film, but Moore frequently doesn't dig deep enough or probe
or postulate far enough about some of the things he uncovers.  For instance,
he discusses the Afgan pipeline and some of its history, but he doesn't go
back 30 years to explore the real story of American involvement in the
pipeline pre-Soviet Afghanistan.Also, he makes it seem like Bush didn't react to the bombings because he was
either being just plain stupid or just didn't know what to do.  He fails to
uncover material pertaining to the PNC (Plan for the New American Century)
initially created by Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz years ago during the Clinton
years which in its final form calls for things like multiple wars on
multiple fronts (Iraq, Afghanistan?) catalyzed by a "new Pearl Harbor"
(9/11?) which if dissected to the degree Moore uses for other subjects here,
would have been a much more powerful, and conspiratorial movie implying more
than just Bush's family connection to the Saudis and his own incompetence. 
Instead, he just defames Bush by pointing out how corrupt his family ties
are to the Saudis and making him look like he's just some kind of idiot punk
cowboy out for war of any kind.The overall problem of the film is that the only people that are going to
see it are the choir which he is basically preaching to.  Real conservatives
have already been told what it's about and they've heard the story before,
so in the end all it is ultimately going to do is strengthen both camps and
further separate the national political bases.

I am very happy that Cinemark did not bow to a few extremists in their
choice to show this film. Censorship has no place in the movies. As a
theoretical "Democracy" we should all be able to view, or not view this
movie and make our own decision as to its merits. To deny its
distribution would be to create an society that is exactly what we
claim to abhor in Iraq. As Americans we are a member of a Democracy and
have the right to view and listen to anything that is not found to be
illegal in our courts. Even Hate groups have the right to speak as they
please as evidenced often by a vast array of people ranging from
Neo-Natzis to Right-Wing extremists. Many of our fore-fathers and great
leaders warned against ever fearing to question our government. To do
so would represent a total failure of what our forefathers attempted to
achieve when they created our government. They attempted to create a
form of government unlike the one they fled that would allow freedom
from government oppression. In spite of some "Hate" groups, this vision
has carried forward as to the foresight shown in the drafting of our
Constitution and the separation of powers to always keep any branch of
our own government from gaining complete control. I suppose they
understood the saying "Power Corrupts, Absolute Power Corrupts
Absolutely!" I would like to Thank Cinemark as well as all the other
theaters who showed this film to let the "People" be the judge of its
merits. After all letting the People decide is what a Democracy is all
about. Isn't it?

Geez, Louise! It's just a film. Notice that I did not say documentary.
Mr. Moore doesn't make documentaries, he makes political commentaries.
As such, he directs and edits to make his point. My only real advice is
to take everything with a grain of salt, as you should anything
describing events you haven't been eyewitness to.I enjoyed the movie--as a movie and as a thought-challenging
experience, but hardly agree with it on all points or find it to be a
work of genius. That's all I'll say as to politics.As for the commenter who asked what would've happened if Leni
Riefenstahl had made an anti-Nazi movie in 1937... She would probably
have been killed or at the very least exiled for it. Let all of us be glad we live in a time and place where we can discuss
this freely.

Though the film drags in the second half of this two-hour documentary,
Moore packs a powerful punch in that time as well. Succinct and
irreverent, Moore puts in one place all the evidence that the Bush
Administration has dropped the ball since 9/11. Moore uses a blackout
screen to go over the events of that day (similar to a previous
documentary), and I will always be eternally grateful that those images
from the day are not displayed in the film. Even with that sentiment,
the sound of the planes hitting was enough to bring that day back
vividly.The powerful images of our heroic troops fighting a senseless war in
Iraq, as well as the touching portrait of the lady who lost her son in
a helicopter crash in Iraq, demands that we asked the question: was
Iraq worth the price we paid, and are we safer in the world now? Run, don't walk, to the movie theater to see it.

Quite simply, this is a movie that must be seen by everyone. It will
have the power to ignite a fire under the collect rear of America and I
think we all can agree- it's about time.I stepped into the movie skeptical, already knowing a lot about Bush's
connections to the bin Laden family and the Haliburton oil deals. But
Michael Moore managed to connect events that no one in the media takes
time to do. The result is a disturbing picture of Bush's interests and
extreme shortfalls when it comes to running anything successfully- from
failed oil businesses to this country's foreign policy.But Bush's failures aren't the driving force of this movie. The second
half, in which a mother who lost her son in Iraq is featured, is
extraordinarily powerful. Her loss is what most of America has been
prevented from seeing because of different government policies. But to
watch this woman go to Washington, DC months after her son is killed
and break down in front of the White House is gripping. Moore does a
wonderful job of showing her grief in the midst of another tourist
grilling the mother on her loss. "Where did you son die?" as if she
didn't believe the mother. Then she leaves with the harsh "yeah well a
lot of other people lost someone too." Moore doesn't say a word,
thankfully, and lets the audience judge for itself the cruelness and
ignorance of some people who blindly stand behind the Iraq invasion.This is definitely worth seeing, no matter where you stand in the
political spectrum. I'm not going to pretend that the movie is
objective- far from it. But no one who claims to love America and stand
for freedom should be afraid of the debate and questions this movie
will raise.

Congratulations to Michael Moore for a successful liberal propaganda
film. I enjoyed the movie and laughed several times. When it comes to
real facts, the movie loses credibility. I will never believe that Bush
put his own interests ahead of the security of this nation. That would
make his own family unsafe, and his legacy a failure. This movie
undermines the presidency unfairly. It is easy to either demonize or
idealize a person (as Bill Clinton said on Larry King). Bush has made
mistakes in the war on terror and is not a great orator. He is a true
American and would never sell his soul to the Saudis or any country. As
for the Iraq war, Moore's questioning of the motives is right on. The
case for weapons of mass destruction was poorly made by Bush's
administration. This does not change the fact that Saddam was a danger
to his neighbors, especially Israel. He used chemical weapons on his
own people and funded suicide bombers. He launched missiles at Israel
during the Gulf War. He was an evil man. Bush did a poor job of
building a coalition and getting world support. He was too impatient.
Overall, the movie exposes the arrogance of the Bush presidency, but is
not a "smoking gun" like watergate.

Michael Moore has created a documentary of ingenious substance. He is
awakening the truth about the Bush Administration and their four years
of lieing and BSing. The Republicans don't want this movie out cause
it's the truth and thats something they just hate. Michael Moore is a
concerned citizen not a traitor, thats what people should realize. Do
not listen to the critical media, go watch this film and encourage your
friends to do the same. Our country was moving forward with Bill
Clinton even though he had his share of problems our country was moving
forward. The Republicans hate that Michael Moore is opening ordinary
Americans up to the fact that we are living in a world of lies.
President Bush does not care about the average citizen but only his own
political and economic interests. Please go see this movie with an open
mind and you will be transfixed. It is easily the best film in years.
No joke, this movie is easily the best thought provoking film I've ever
seen. Tell all of your friends to go see this movie and to vote for
John Kerry for president so we can stop the lies. 10/10

This film is going to pack a wallop. People will love it or hate it
with not much in between. All you have to do is look at the IMDb ratings to see that. There's a
couple hundred people who gave the movie 10s and a somewhat smaller
bunch that gave it 1s and not much in between. (Makes me wonder how many of these folks have actually seen the film.)I saw it. I think it ranks with "Columbine" as a powerful but deeply
flawed presentation. Mike's work, as always, uses a lot of very
gripping images that cannot be argued with: recruiters lying to kids to
get them to sign up, babies burned and mutilated by US bombs, and the
incredible seven minutes that the Commander-in-Chief of the US military
spent sitting in a classroom reading "My Pet Goat" after he had been
told the second tower had been hit and the nation was under attack. You
think Bill Clinton would have sat there waiting for someone to tell him
what to do? Or even, God forbid, Richard Nixon? Hell no. Now, on the other hand, Mike is as fast and loose with the facts in
this movie as ever. He always shoots himself in the foot by making dumb
fact errors and editing footage to show his point of view in the best
possible light. I wish he wouldn't. Because so much of what he has to
say is really important, and really deserves to be heard. Leaving your
enemies a big hole through which to drive is just dumb. Go see the movie for yourself and judge for yourself. You're smart. You
don't need Michael Moore to tell you what to think, or Move America
Forward to tell you that all good Americans will close their eyes, put
their fingers in their ears and hope this movie goes away.

I saw this in the theater a couple years ago and I kept having to using
the bathroom so I missed most of it. So I watched it again and just
like his movie, "Sicko" I became even more angry at the American
government. Some people think that nothing in this movie is true but
the truth really is that the people in the United States of America are
being lied to now more than ever. Moore talks about 9/11 and the war in
Iraq. This is such a hard movie to watch. Especially the families of
all the people who died in Iraq and I am not just writing about the
soldiers and their families. I am also writing about the people who
live in Iraq who didn't do a thing to anyone and they died. It's tragic
to watch a little boy get his head stitched together. Micheal Moore did
a great job and I cannot wait for the sequel.

At the peak of my own short-lived, hard-core liberalism, "Fahrenheit
9/11" was THE movie to see. After the whirlwind controversy regarding
its theatrical release that led to a successful opening weekend at the
box office, I found myself impressed by Michael Moore's chutzpah and
fearlessness, but also his blatant (and acknowledged) opportunism in
making this stunning expose on the Bush Administration a tool to
adversely affect his chances of re-election in 2004 (well, we all know
that turned out). I've said this many times, but I became disillusioned
upon Dubya's second term, and politically apathetic; until tonight, my
previous viewing of "Fahrenheit" was prior to the election. Three years
later, even to my currently-disenfranchised self, the film carries an
impact that is no less potent. While Moore is skilled in
organizing/editing his films to best back up his leftist stance, he is
ultimately just as manipulative as the nightly news in his efforts to
invoke a reaction of outrage from his audience. But despite this, I
thoroughly enjoyed the film--my reaction ranged from laughter (a
"Bonanza" send-up entitled "Afghanistan"), spine-tingling chills (the
sound effects of 9/11 played over a black screen), and yes, outrage
(especially when bin Laden's relatives were flown out of the U.S. days
after the attacks, while commercial airlines remained grounded). The
footage shot within Iraq is grim and disquieting, and some could easily
dismiss this as sensationalism; yet when you consider how sanitized the
network news has made the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is an
unpleasant truth whose image certainly merits display, if only to snap
us back to reality. While Moore's guerrilla-theater denouement (of the
filmmaker and a soldier soliciting pencil-necked senators to sign their
kids up for the military) is a fizzle, the footage of Lila Lipscomb (a
Flint, MI mother whose son is killed in Iraq) is extremely moving. For
as messy as the details surrounding pre- and post-9/11 have been, Moore
does a fine job distilling the facts through a slightly smug, always
opinionated veneer that keeps the viewer interested; but maybe more
importantly, the film overall exemplifies the director's own patriotism
(which many debate or decry), while making the pundits and anchors of
nightly news programs seem like anemic and shameful vessels disclosing
a watered-down view of "what's going on in the world."

Everyone should take the time to have a look on this film. It is not
about conspiracy theories. Its about what the manipulators don't want
us to know, and the powerlessness of the world media. It might be
pathetic that someone comes out with the stories all networks and
newspapers should report, even a bit later than the events in question,
but at least it includes a lot of the facts in one go. Wake up people
all over the globe and listen to the truth, the true voice. Join your
voices in one and let everyone know that the people cant take any more
happy pills. There is an old saying, "people's voice is god's wrath". I
gave this film the highest vote, although I don't believe it was
perfect, only because Moore has balls!

"We wage a war to save civilisation itself", says US President George W
Bush during Mike Moore's Palme D'Or-winning Fahrenheit 9/11. "We didn't
seek it, but we will fight it, and we will prevail." But Moore, who won last year's best documentary Oscar for Bowling For
Columbine, mounts a damning case against the self-proclaimed "war
President", with a film that is more polemic than traditional
documentary. There's so much information in this film that it's unmissable, no
matter what your political alignment. Beginning with the notorious
"stolen election" that gave Bush Florida and the presidency in 2000,
Fahrenheit moves through the first eight unpopular months of Bush's
presidency. According to the Washington Post, he was on holiday 42 per
cent of that time. An abrupt shift to a black screen signals the onset
of 9/11, presented as sound without images, and all the more emotive
for it.Moore's characteristic humour is less apparent in Fahrenheit than in
his other works but appears when mocking Bush's initial indecision in
the face of the 9/11 strikes. More disturbing are the Bush family's
alleged Saudi connections, and the overall Saudi investment in the US
economy (around 7 per cent). And most affecting are the images of
suffering Iraqui civilians. Unfortunately, their story is cut short to
concentrate on the US army's plight in the war that's claimed the
largest number of military deaths since Vietnam. ****/***** stars.

Anyone who sees this needs to see "FahrenHYPE 9/11," which is basically
the right wing answer to "Fahrenheit 9/11." FahrenHYPE exposes a lot of
Michael Moore's deceitful editing techniques. However, FahrenHYPE also
tries to portray Bush as the greatest leader ever. It even tries to
justify the Iraq war by comparing Saddam's threat to the U.S. with
Hitler!!! Saddam is/was a bug that could be squashed easily when
compared with the threat of Hitler. Anyhow, Moore's film-making is
brilliant, which is why I still consider this a great movie. If you want to laugh, cry, and be angry all in the span of a 2 hour
movie, Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" is very entertaining. Just do
NOT expect to have all the facts. The basis of his argument is mostly
correct, but he uses deceitful ways to edit the footage and statistics.
This film is a brilliant piece of propaganda that would make ANYONE
angry at Bush after seeing it. Rating: 8/10 (based on the film)...2/10 (based on its "facts" that do
not support it enough and are basically lies)

** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS **(if that is possible)Well, I hope to try to comment this movie without involving to much
politics, but I realize that may be hard to do. However, I'll do my
best.First, this documentary is biased, I have no doubt about it. Moore has
cut and used cinematic tricks to emphasize his view and opinion. But at
least he is obvious about it, and it is pretty easy to recognize and
disregard. That said, I believe there are a lot of interesting facts
that Moore tells in an effective and mostly humorous way. That there is
a big part comedy here does not at all diminish the facts, instead it
is used well to emphasize facts. There is also coverage from the war,
and I must point out that those scenes are not at all funny, mostly
they are horrible and disturbing. But in a cinematic sense, those
scenes and pictures are well used and very powerful. The movie is well
directed and narrated, apart from a few scenes that were simply
stretched out longer than their message and importance merited. As a
result, the pace sometimes got too slow. But the music selected, and
how it was used, was superb.However told, this is a movie presenting many interesting facts, that
should make you think. It doesn't matter what political opinion you
have, or what conclusions you draw. There are important facts to see
and consider. So, see this movie and then make up your mind about it.
Do not trash or glorify the movie without having seen it. It is better
than that.8/10

It is perhaps a little late to watch this movie, as its stated purpose
was to educate Americans in time for the presidential election. But
even without the backdrop of the election, this is a supremely
relevant, powerful movie.Director Michael Moore, noted for his documentary Roger and Me and
later his short-lived television series TV Nation, begins with a simple
premise: that President George W. Bush's first term, particularly since
the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, has been deeply flawed. Moore
examines the handling of terrorism in the months prior to September 11,
the president's reaction to the attacks, and the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq overall. Moore leaves very few stones unturned in his thorough
dissertation of U.S. foreign policy of the past few years.It really doesn't matter if you the viewer agree with Moore; his aim is
to make you feel something, whether it's disgust toward the
administration or disdain toward the film and its creator. If you're a
staunch Republican who supports the president no matter what, you
almost certainly won't be swayed by this movie; you're far more likely
to view it as leftist propaganda. If you're an opponent of the
president and his policies, this movie will only reinforce your
viewpoint. So, in that sense, it is definitely propaganda - clearly so.Moore's MO is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. And
boy, are there plenty of both in this movie. He interviews soldiers in
Iraq; some are elated to be there and treat gunning down Iraqis like a
video game, and others are openly dissatisfied for not being allowed to
return stateside, even though their tours of duty have expired. Moore
interviews the mother of a soldier stationed in Iraq; in the beginning
of the movie, she's gung-ho for the war, proud that her children are
overseas (she even says she thinks she's the proudest around, as if it
were a contest). By the end of the movie, she's a grieving mother of a
soldier killed in battle. Her scenes are searing in their emotion. She
reads a letter from him, the last one he wrote; she'd received it a
week or so before he died. Among Moore's other tactics is badgering various members of Congress,
asking them if they would mind enlisting their children. (Turns out
only one member of Congress has a child serving in Iraq.) None will do
so, which isn't surprising. Moore also examines the connection between
the Bush family and the bin Laden family, especially pre-9/11, the
strength of the relationship between the Saudi Arabian government
(well, ruling family) and the Bush family, and the relationship between
the Saudis and the United States economy.It's important to recognize this movie for what it is; it's dangerous
to assume that it's a straightforward documentary. It's an unabashed
look at what historians may someday call one of the worst presidencies
in American history. For now, though, it's just the first half.

Fahrenheit 9/11 is a great movie for many reasons. I think that every
American who loves his or her country would want to watch it and
discuss it with friends and family members. Just as our Founding
Fathers fought for our freedom in the 18th century (and many Americans
have fought to preserve it in their subsequent lifetimes), we must
fight to keep our democracy great for ourselves and the generations to
come. Yes, we have external enemies, but we also have to stand up to
the current administration and demand that we be told the truth. That
doesn't seem like it's asking so much, yet the president and his
supporters want us to believe that if we question them, if we ask for
the truth, if we don't give them "blank checks" to do whatever they
want, that we are somehow not patriotic Americans. I AM a patriotic
American, and obviously (to anyone who sees the movie) so is Michael
Moore.

... regardless of your political affiliation. It is very well and
convincingly put together, its logic easy to follow, providing a view
point that is skillfully made plausible. While I don't want to offer an
opinion on what is presented accurately, what might be stretched or
misrepresented, the point of it all is this: It is plausibly presented
and we all have an obligation to determine for ourselves what is true
and what is not and then act accordingly, for instance, on election
day.I urge everyone to remember the question how on earth a Nazi Germany
came to such power in the late '30s and was subsequently able to commit
horrendous crimes against mankind and what the answers were to that
question: "We didn't know," "we heard rumors, but didn't believe it
could be possible," and "we only followed orders." Not that I, by any
means, mean to suggest any commonalities between the present American
government and the German Nazi regime or put them in any way on the
same level. However, we all should have learned a lesson from history:
You HAVE to consider "the impossible," you HAVE to listen to all view
points, you HAVE to inform yourself, and you HAVE to subsequently act
accordingly.Micheal Moore presents a view point that is virtually eliminated from
main stream media coverage, although it is shared by many. As a freedom
loving, democratic people, we all have an obligation to listen to it,
consider it, and build our opinion about it - AFTERwards.What Michael Moore does is, at the very least, raise questions and
present his basis for these questions. Leaders in any nation need to be
questioned continuously, not only if there is the least bit of doubt
about their motives, intentions, and actions, but especially then. It
is our responsibility to ensure that our leaders are indeed
representing us the way we want to be represented for reasons that lie
in our best interests. And one can only do that if one is willing to
listen to the other side, even if we hear uncomfortable things or
things that may seem a bit "far off." Michael Moore has shown in his
movie that there is indeed another side to what we are fed day in, day
out on main stream television, and that side deserves a good looking
at. See this movie!

Like Michael Moore and his politics or hate 'em, it's undeniable that
"Fahrenheit 9/11" is one thoroughly entertaining, thought-provoking and
immensely watchable movie.Moore might rely on guilt by association, but his film's so damn
effective because amidst the skewering of the Bush presidency, he
tosses in nuggets of truth too strong to discount. There's the
Washington Post's finding that Bush spent 42 percent of his first eight
months in office (weekends included) on vacation and, insinuations
aside, well-documented business relationships. You don't have to take
as gospel everything in this satirical documentary. You shouldn't. But
it's a helluva launching pad for debate - discussions that should have
occurred months before our young men and women were sent to die in
Iraq. Especially, since we know the rationale turned out to be wrong
and we very likely were misled. Moore insinuates, you decide.Subtlety has never been Moore's forte. He can be boorish and
self-aggrandizing, but this is a more mature work than his previous
films. He tackles the 9/11 attacks with restraint and knows the
strength of his story barely needs his in-your-face shtick. Moore revels in being cheeky, too - his "Bonanza" parody is inspired.
Clips from a "Rebuilding Iraq" conclave underscore the aim of war
profiteers and the sound bite at the end brilliantly depicts a leader
who can't grasp simple declarative sentences, let alone idiomatic
speech.Moore's accumulated sensationally good footage - priceless scenes of
the attorney general singing, Bush at a fund-raiser of "the haves and
have-mores" (as the president puts it), a vacationing Bush insisting
he's doing the nation's work, yet struggling to come up with what
exactly that is, and shots of Bush seemingly making faces just before
he's about to announce to the world that he's waging war on Iraq.Moore attacks Democrats, too. He exposes their cowardice for not
questioning Bush's decision to go to war against Iraq and their
inexcusable behavior when not a single Democratic senator agreed to
make formal the Congressional Black Caucus' protest of the
certification of the 2000 election results.The film also shows how easy it is for our leaders to manipulate the
public and curb constitutional rights because, sadly, Americans are
quite willing to sacrifice their rights for the false feeling of
security in a post-9/11 America.The film's greatest impact comes when Moore turns to the Iraq war,
complete with harrowing scenes of carnage, including bloody civilian
casualties, sad tales of U.S. military casualties at Walter Reed and
disillusioned soldiers at Fort Campbell, Ky. And there's the
heartbreaking story of Lila Lipscomb, a flag-waving patriot whose visit
to the White House is emotionally devastating cinema verité.The film isn't flawless. Scenes of Iraqis enjoying life before the war
includes nothing about our one-time ally Saddam's brutality. And Moore
perhaps shouldn't have surmised what was on Bush's mind as the
president sat still for seven minutes during a photo-op at a Florida
elementary school after being told of the second plane hitting the WTC.
We get the point in spite of Moore's narration.Republicans insist Bush did nothing initially to exhibit strength,
stability and calm. The footage seems to convey a stunned president who
has no clue what to do next. There's more panic and confusion in those
eyes than calmness. You can just picture another president, say, JFK,
making an amusing quip about having to leave early, calmly rising and
snapping into action, without waiting for an aide telling him what to
do or sticking around to read "My Pet Goat." Patriotism isn't merely flying the flag or adorning your car with
"These Colors Don't Run" Stars-and-Stripes, or for that matter,
"Redefeat Bush," bumper stickers. The profound insight of a gum-chewing
Britney Spears notwithstanding - she tells an interviewer Americans
should trust, and never question, the president's decisions - being
skeptical of our leaders, especially in times of crises is patriotic. As brutal, scathing and passionate an indictment of a president,
government leaders and their motives as this film is, it remains
tremendously funny, audacious, defiant, poignant, provocative and sad
without ever losing its focus. It exemplifies patriotism. If this film
prompts more discussion and skepticism of our government's actions,
then Moore's performed a truly patriotic act.

...but unsubtle, ungracefully and inelegantly made. But maybe now in a
time of ignorance and superficiality such brazen tactics are the only
way to make us understand. Perhaps Moore's critics don't understand
that there is no REAL truth. Covering something from all angles, be it
a war, an argument or a misunderstanding doesn't lead to pure truth,
only confusion.It's no secret that Moore has an agenda with this film. And I agreed
with it long before I saw it. The point is President Bush must not be
re-elected. And Moore gives us hundreds of reasons why. However it's
the manipulation of the editing and arranging of montages that prevent
the film from having any real dignity or class. Sure there is a sense
of humor and huge understanding of American politics (you MUST pay
attention to every last word) but Moore's point is too biased to really
connect with me. Not that I think Bush deserves any sympathy or a
second (or 1, 345, 456th) chance. It's just that his intentions come
across too forcefully. Yes, the war in Iraq is unjust and the biggest lie and waste of human
life since the Vietnam catastrophe. And all for what? For money,
nothing more than paper. If we ever come through this will we trust the
Government again? Most ominously not. After watching this film will you
ever trust the Government again? I promise you...you won't!There are some powerful scenes, a woman breaking down in tears reading
a letter from her dead son who died in Iraq for Bush's greed, every
Senator Moore meets refusing to sign their children up for the Army
while poor black kids from the projects willingly sign up, the charred
bodies of US soldiers being dragged through the streets in Iraq. But
the most effective part of the film was also the most ingenious. The
opening to Fahrenheit 9/11 plays the sounds of planes crashing into the
WTC on a black screen. Powerful effects without the use of images at
all. Why? We've seen it so many time we need not see it again. Because
terrorism is blind. Out of respect for people sensitive for such images
being exploited yet again. And to heighten our awareness of the horror
of just screaming and panic and the cheapening of human life.There are parts of this film that will rile you up and enrage you, be
it the skillful arranging of facts or the ignorant bystander calling
the woman crying over her dead son 'staged'. Sadly though, it wanders
off the point in the middle and kind of sags. If it had been leaner then I wouldn't have gotten so impatient. But as
it stands Fahrenheit 9/11 is an unapologetic firestorm designed to rip
right through the Whitehouse and the Senate. With any luck it will.We may not ever trust any new administration but we'll NEVER be fooled
again. Lesson might be learned. But at what price?

I don't know if everything, or anything for that matter, in Fahrenheit
9/11 is true or not, but the evidence, however biased or one-sided it
may be, sure seems to be overwhelming against President Bush and his
constituents as a group of people who's motivations, and the end
results of those motivations, were not for the the majority of the
American people, especially the poorer ones, but were in fact, for
those who are the Have's, not the Have Not's. Unfortunately for those
of you who are the Have Not's, you will remain the Have Not's. I don't
question the desire to succeed, whether it be economically, socially or
politically, but what I do question is the means about how one does so.
Why do we value the material and not the thing that should matter
most...how we treat a fellow human being?

This is one of the most inflammatory movies ever to see wide release.
Love him or hate him, Michael Moore has put together a compelling film.
Critics will quibble about statistics cited and opinions offered, but
there is too much damning evidence in this film that suggests 1) Bush
went after the wrong people following 9/11; and 2) we were misled into
a war with Iraq. If George W. Bush fails to win re-election in 2004, this film can take
at least partial credit. It's that powerful.As of July 6, 2004, I had seen the film twice. Once at 11:45 p.m. on
opening day, once at 2:45 p.m. on the Monday afternoon ten days after
its release. Both houses were packed with few or no empty seats, and
people cried audibly during certain scenes in both showings. To write this film off without seeing it would be intellectually
bankrupt, no matter what your political affiliation.

We saw Fahrenheit 9/11 with a clearly partisan crowd. The reluctant Marine
was applauded when he explained his refusal to return to Iraq if ordered.
The closing line following Bush's bumbling the 'fool me once...twice...' was
lost in applause and laughter. (if anyone can shoot me that Moore's retort,
I would be forever grateful). And there was a clear absence of the usual
crowd of those who think that they're sitting in their living rooms in
dialogue with the characters on the screen. It was Saturday afternoon, after
the opening day and there wasn't an empty seat in the house. Even with the
blockbusters, that seldom happens.If Kerry winds up in the White House will he have a friend in Michael Moore?
Not really because the same invective used so effectively against the Bush
administration can easily be turned against another rich white guy with
family ties.What impact have Moore's films had? He has been preaching to the choir
forever. Will this be the one? Let's hope.He makes strong arguments without the shackles of objectivity. Reviewers are
urging all persuasions to see it. But will they? I doubt
it.Cynical me? Nah!

This is an very important film about a VERY important time in the
history of the U.S. We are at a crossroad in our destiny and the
importance of knowing what kind of people are running this country
should be an over-riding concern. Did I say ruining this country ?
Another important note is that this is an extremely well-made
documentary. It is easy to see why it won Cannes' highest award. This
film should be viewed with an eye towards factual accuracy. Keep in
mind that most of what you now see in a "newscast" is less accurate
than ever before due to the limited scope of ownership of media in the
U.S. As an editor, it embarrases me to see how news media often present
"experts" who are really shills for the extreme right wing. Mr. Moore
is to be congratulated for his wonderful condensation of reality into
an entertaining, informative, and concise examination of the most
frightening attempt by our government to assert TOTAL CONTROL.

When you see for yourself Michael Moore's juxtaposition of pre-9/11
interviews of figures like Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice, asserting
that Saddam Hussein has "not rebuilt his army", and can not (in Rice's
words) "even project conventional (military) power on his neighbors",
with post-9/11 footage in which THE VERY SAME PEOPLE insist that Saddam
Hussin is an imminent threat to the security of the United States,
developing nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction and
collaborating with Al-Qaeda, you will understand exactly what Michael
Moore is trying to say - we were duped. The American people were duped
into a war that was not necessary, with an enemy that was not a threat.But why did our government dupe us in a time of war, when we were under
attack from a very REAL enemy? Farenheit 911 answers this question with
an indisputable fact: there was A LOT, LOT, LOT more MONEY to be made
by the military-industrial complex by invading Iraq, a country with the
world's second largest oil deposits and a large well-developed
infrastructure that would need to be rebuilt, vs. Afghanistan, a poor
undeveloped country with no natural resources and no infrastructure of
any type to destroy or to rebuild.Consider this: less than 20,000 American troops invaded Afghanistan (a
state run by Islamic terrorists who openly gave OSAMA BIN LADEN SAFE
HAVEN), but nearly 140,000 American troops invaded Iraq, a country
whose secular dictator hasn't threatened America in over a decade, and
whose alleged "weapons of mass destruction" have never been found, even
in traces. Michael Moore made a lot of statements in this film I did not
completely agree with. For example, in the film's opening, he asserts
that Bush won the 2000 election through fraudulent means. Although he
presents some compelling evidence for this, it is not conclusive. He
also exaggerates some figures, such as saying that Bush proposed
cutting combat soldiers' pay by 33%. In reality, it was only Imminent
Danger/Hostile Fire Pay he proposed cutting, a bonus received by
soldiers in designated combat zones, and no soldier was at risk of
having his overall pay cut by 33%. Additionally, he uses broad
stereotypes, such as displaying the Netherlands as a nation of drug
addicts in his mockery of the U.S-led "Coalition of the Willing" to
topple Saddam. In reality, the Netherlands has a well trained modern
military.But these minor exaggerations did not distract me from the well
illustrated truth of the overriding theme of this movie: that the Bush
administration used the 9/11 attacks to rally Americans into supporting
an unjust war on Iraq, for the enrichment of his wealthy supporters in
the military-industrial complex, at the expense of the lives of the men
and women of the U.S military, AND AT THE EXPENSE of catching Osama Bin
Laden, the real perpetrator of 9/11.I was not old enough to vote when Bush was re-elected. If I had been, I
probably would have voted for Bush, like most Americans, including my
family, who trusted the President unflinchingly in the days after 9/11.
This movie opened my eyes. Now that I am 18, there is no doubt where my
vote will go in 2008. If you are a thinking person, this movie will
open your eyes too.

could be one of the factors in the nail of President George W. Bush's

Michel moore was one of my favorite filmmaker since he managed to
embarrass powerful people wearing his common blue jeans and pointing a
shameless camera to their faces. Those were his real power and charm: a
looser type of figure who knows everything about 'them' and have the
guts and the right kind of passion to go out 'there' and show 'them'
the true power of freedom of speech.That all changed for me since I saw this film. In one point I thought
that this film got all the characteristics of the Nazi propaganda: it
sets the target (the bush administrator for that matter) and starts
circling a bunch of half facts combines with obvious emotional
manipulations around it. This is pure, violent and very efficient
propaganda material rather then a shocking objective documentary. And
Michel? My favorite filmmaker? Well he still wear them Jeans (well
maybe a profound research would reveal that the company that saw them
belongs to the Usama family ?) and he still talk in that warm concerned
voice but he abuses his freedom of speech in an awful attempt to throw
mud in his president face and sand in his fans eyes.

Before I went to see Farenheit 9/11 I saw Bowling for Columbine to see
just what all the fuss was about with Michael Moore. I must say that
Bowling for Columbine had been presented in a rather unique way in
which I had not been accustomed to when viewing documentaries.Documentaries either present something factual in an entertaining
format, displaying facts straight-forward and in-your-face, or they
have the potential to drag out and bore the audience into a stupor. For
the duration of Farenheit 9/11 it does nothing in the latter.Of course this is only the tip of the iceberg. To be honest I had never
seen such impactive scenes in a documentary in my life. It can go from
being hilarious (Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Tony Blair storming into
Afghanistan a la Bonanza) to the downright emotional (the mother whose
son was killed in Iraq confronting the White House in a highly
emotional scene which I will always remember).Farenheit 9/11 is a must-see film. People from all walks of life should
see it.

Firstly, my point of view about George Bush is that he is probably one
of the worst presidents the USA has ever had.This film however is so one sided that if I was American I'd vote for
Bush next time just to p*** Michael Moore off.I'm not an expert on Bush's life or American politics, but I know
enough to see the one sided view portrayed in this film.Michael Moore has done some great work, I personally love his programme
on the Nike corporation.This is a good documentary and is well put together but in the long run
its biased point of view discredits the message its trying to convey.

Released in the eye of a storm of controversy, Michael Moore's
Fahrenheit 9/11 is a potent indictment of the moronic administration
that is currently running the self-proclaimed most powerful nation on
Earth. I myself am not an American, and wasn't a fan of George W. Bush
before watching this movie anyway, so many of the ideas that Moore
presents were already instilled in my mind prior to watching; but the
way Moore argues and the relativity and believability of many of the
facts that Moore uses are likely to put doubts in the minds of even the
most ardent of Dubya fans. Michael Moore has clearly done his homework
on the issues he raises in this film (which is what you'd expect), and
the way that the movie is put together is eye opening, intriguing and a
lot of the time, very funny. Moore is very sarcastic, and the way that
some of his arguments are put forward border on genius. The western
style attack on Afghanistan and the "dream" sequence at the start are
among the best of them.There's some great tunes on display in the movie, and the way that
Moore has selected his music is hilarious. While REM's "Shiny Happy
People" plays against the backdrop of Bush shaking hands and smiling
with various Saudi Arabian's, you cant help but laugh. The film is at
it's best and most potent while Moore is feeding the audience
information about Bush's administration and his relationship with the
Bin Laden's. It's obvious that Moore feels passionate about the subject
material, and he gives it his all with a variety of different fact
giving methods. However, when we enter the final third, the film takes
a huge downturn. Moore professes that the press doesn't cover the
individual loss of life for each soldier because it's "too much of a
downer", and so he does so here. Ironically, it puts a huge downer on
the film as the high-energy debate that was raging in the first hour
fades away into a routine showing of the tragedy of war. This was
perhaps a necessary route for Moore to take, but I'd have liked the
film a lot more if Moore had stayed on topic, even if means a shorter
movie.

Reguardless of whether you are a Democrat, Republican, or anything
else, and regardless of your opinions of anything, this is a film you
need to see. Whether you come away with a totally new perspective or an
unchanged one is unimportant. This film is biased, but that's not the
point. The point is that this film shows and tells things that no one
else does. The film is edited and narrated by a man who has a strong
opinion and is trying to make a point, but the clips you are seeing are
all real, and you will never see them on CNN on Fox News. It is a true
crime that the level of actual information in the national media has
dropped to such a low. No one who claims to be an educated American or
who feels they have the right to vote should ignore this film. We are
given enough "feel good" journalism on TV. It's about time we saw
something that is disturbing, raw, and honest, and that asks the tough
and important questions that nobody else asks any more. As far as the
actual art of the film it's better than most documentaries, not nearly
as well crafted as Moore's last effort, "Bowling for Columbine". Still,
even now, after the election, I think everyone should watch this movie
because there are a lot of facts in it that you will find difficulty
getting straight anywhere else.

I hate it when a person talks to me like I am in the third grade. It is
insulting, being a highly educated person to be talked to like I could
not possibly comprehend what is going on. Fahrenheit 9/11 is two hours
of that.And that is directly representative of how the liberals view the people
of this country. Idiots who could not possibly understand the
intricacies of life or politics. This movie is very poorly done with
regards to documentary films. Documentaries show the situation, and
allow the viewer to arrive at their own conclusion. Documentaries are
also filmmakers investigating a theory. Sometimes they are disproven.
Michael Moore does not allow the truth to alter his theory. He
manipulates film clips to force them to conform to an incorrect
hypothesis. And he lies in baby talk throughout the film, forcing the
viewer to think that someone using such small words and such idiotic
tones could not possibly be lying, the person narrating isn't smart
enough to concoct lies. Well Mr. Moore is a unique individual. A
product of the chat room conspiracy theories and a working knowledge of
a camera. Someone not smart enough to seek the truth, but not dumb
enough to be able to craft a fictitious truth from smart bits of
irrelevant information. This is truly a POS.

Moore took a great premise and gave back a sophomoric film with little bite.
 First half of the movie is very strong and presents a good deal of
conjecture and causal analysis.  Moore cannot stay on this path, and begins
to degrade the impact of this film by showing us shocking and distasteful
scenes in place of thoughtful and provoking argument.  His focus on himself
as left wing crusader makes a mockery of all the hard work people have put
in to prevent, limit, and fight the battles.  We all know war is hell, but
the arguments against going to war were strong, the dedication to the
warriors true, but he makes all soldiers appear to be childish,
testosterone-fueled buffoons.  Not far, or fully accurate.  The message is
excellent, the method immature.

This movie hopefully confirms to the American people what most Canadians
already felt about Bush and the whole Iraq war debacle. That is why our
government, as well as many other UN countries, made the very risky choice
to not join the so called "coalition of the willing". Michael Moore appears
to be succeeding in opening the eyes of the very people who can stop this
madness - the American people. Most of the rest of the world already knows.
That is why it was so important for this to be released in the USA of all
places. If this helps to get the country back on track by enraging the
masses enough to vote accordingly in the next election, Moore should be
given a place in government. This movie could very well save the soul of
America and that is what makes it so much more than just a great
documentary. Hopefully people of all nations will owe Moore a huge debt of
gratitude as this type of film could literally change the future of the
human race. Bravo to him for having the wherewithal and the courage to tell
it.

a short time after the movie started i looked down at my watch.... 2
hours already passed and the movie was just about over. maybe it was
because unlike bowling for columbine, the information that was supplied
to me was nothing really new for me, but i found this flick to be
almost boring.the only parts that really caught my interest were the two recruit
officers (and the irony of the poor fighting to maintain the system),
and the utah patrols....i'm not saying this is a bad movie, it just wasn't for me. i think
it can be an excellent movie for people who have not been able to keep
up as much with world events.

I Norway, many students, like me, watched this movie with their class
at the cinema. Michael Moore is, maybe, a bit exstreme, and we don't no
if everything he tells us is true, but the movie looked pretty
convincing to me and my classmates. Michael Moore doesn't make Bush look foolish, he managed that very well
on his own... We talked about the movie in class after we'd seen it,
and we all thought it was very good. Maybe a bit too long, but good.Even though Saddam Hussain was a crazy dictator, innocent people in
Iraq don't deserve to be bombed. When is America gonna stop acting like
a world police man? You're not helping them by bombing and killing
their families. Wake up America!

"nothing is over the line when it finally comes down to winning or
losing the presidency of the United States. Nobody is safe and nothing
is sacred when the stakes finally get that high. It is the ultimate
fast lane, and the people still on their feet in September are usually
the meanest of the mean." - Hunter S. Thompson.Whether you hate Michael Moore or not, you can't deny that his idealism
is in the right place, for he embodies an American concept that is fast
being stultified by the American Government itself  the Right to Free
Speech. Though I question some of Moore's juvenile methods and
embarrassing stunts, I do not refute him the right to prise open the
government's Pandora's Box of guarded, privileged information in an
attempt  misguided or not - to delineate between fact and falsehood. Would that we were all prepared to go to such lengths to expose what we
believe to be truth.For those who righteously complain about Fahrenheit 9/11's one-sided
slant, the same can be said for the government's (and by association,
the media's) blinkered dissemination of information to the public at
large. The litmus test for democracy is that ALL viewpoints be given
equal shrift in the media and in congress; further, that each disparate
viewpoint be afforded the same amount of RESPECT as that which each
individual holds as truth. The hardest part about SAYING you believe in
Freedom is ACTING like you do. In the words of Henry David Thoreau, Moore "serves the State best by
opposing the State most."With this film, Moore has provided the rejoinder to years of enduring
the fascist whims of a government despicable enough to wield the
specter of the long-since-razed Twin Towers as collateral. He is not
merely a gadfly guerrilla film-maker with an agenda steeped summarily
in "opposition" to the reigning Republican Party. He is not
perfunctorily anti-President or anti-government; he is ANTI-DUPLICITY. For this documentary, Moore culled a wealth of disparate strands of
information and fashioned them into a cudgel of defamatory data against
the smug politicos in power. The message of this film is not that
"George Bush is duplicitous"  ALL politicians are duplicitous  the
underlying significance is the realization that ANY government would
have used the WTC attacks to prey upon the fears of the populace to
feather their affluent beds. ANY government would ensure that their
business associates were well cared for during periods of civil unrest
and that an international incident that bottlenecks the world economy
would not quell their rapacious income-earning ability. The first half of "Fahrenheit 9/11" focuses on arousing the intellect,
the second half is drenched in emotive appeal, with Moore shifting the
focus from the highest government offices - perpetuating their blood
money behind the lies they sell to the public - to the lowest grunts in
the trenches, crimson-necked Bubbas to a man, inculcated with those
lies, drenched in misplaced patriotic fervor, empowered to "bring the
ideal of democracy and freedom to (Iraq)". Moore fearlessly does what no "news" program has done before him 
spotlight American politicians backpedaling, contradicting themselves,
talking nonsense - from the transparently furtive Dick Cheney, whose
very presence simply oozes Gollum-like underhandedness and
scum-trickery; to the awkward warbling of John Ashcroft, who instigated
the paradoxically-named Patriot Act; to Donald Rumsfeld mouthing like
an automaton about "the humanity" that goes into bombing innocents.Moore exposes the symbiosis the Bush family shares with the faction
responsible for the 9/11 tragedy  the Taliban. Even with known
allegiance to the terrorist cells known as Al Qaeda, Taliban officers
are still able to saunter more freely through the corridors of the
White House than even born-and-bred Americans. Any wonder that the Bush
Mafioso  whose business dealings with the Taliban net them ten-figure
incomes  are considered co-conspirators in this unethically twisted
financial coup. As one of the interviewees in the film comments, "It's
about making money. It's about making a LOT of money."The fact that George Bush Junior comes across as such a vacuous,
empty-headed paragon of imbecility is no one's fault but his own. Sure,
biased editing and out-of-context statements may be used to contribute
to any public figure's denigration, but the plain truth is that any
person with a modicum of English appreciation needs simply to hear the
stumbling, third-grade elocutionary delivery of this American President
to conclude that it was not "smarts" that won him the White House. We
don't even need to satirize Bush  that chased-ferret look is a
sniggering point to begin with  then he starts speaking...
mispronunciations, malapropisms, grammatical obscenities fly out of
this mental midget's mouth like a tennis ball launcher set on Wimbledon
Pro, coupled with an unwarranted arrogance and condescension (he KNOWS
we know who his dad is) and that uninformed, blank-staring mien as
cream-whipped topping. The film closes with yet another Bush synapse-disconnect. Though one
imagines he would be aware of his limitations by now, apparently George
W. still believes he can successfully venture off-script during
speeches and inject profundity like a Kennedy or a Jefferson. In this
instance, what he tried to say  and ended up burbling incoherently 
was, "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me", but even
a well-worn axiom in the mouth of this ersatz President turns to
mealy-mouth mush:"There's an old saying in Tennessee - I know it's in Texas - probably
Tennessee, that says: Fool me once... shame on... shame on you... If-
fool me- can't get fooled again..." It's appropriate that Dubya's botched aphorism echoes the prophetic Who
song, "Won't Get Fooled Again", for that song's final lyric now attains
a brutal literalism:Meet the new boss / Same as the old boss.(Movie Maniacs, read this unabridged article at:

Towards the end of Fahrenheit 9/11, a grieving mother starts chatting
up with an anti-war protester, talking about what they've lost.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a female comes flying out of nowhere
screaming "this is all staged! This is all staged!" Well, is it? I've
always liked Michael Moore's stuff. Even though, yeah, I don't like
these personalized documentaries where you're the main subject. But
actually, Michael Moore IS in his films, but what makes his films
unique is that he lets his subjects speak for themselves, which always
is 10 X more interesting. In Fahrenheit 9/11, this is more of a
political historical documentary then Bowling For Columbine, as he
tackles many subjects, but mainly focuses on one target. That's right,
George Bush. Moore has done his research well, and his allegations
about Bush are very well documented and thought out. Some of it is
shocking, some of it funny, but a lot of it will get people talking.
Moore declared that his film would lead to Bush not getting elected,
and would win the best picture Oscar which I thoroughly disagree with.
The reason for that is what I said in the beginning, just make your
films Michael, and keep your grandstanding out of it, therefore, you'll
make the film stand on it's own merits (see my opinions at the
beginning of this review).

Just when I gave up all hope on hearing anything sensible from America
concerning the Bush administration, along comes Mr Moore to restore my
faith in this "great" nation.I think Michael Moore is fantastic at
getting to the truth and exposing it for what it is, anyone who enjoyed
this film will also like Bowling for Columbine. Of course Fahrehiet
9/11 is completely one sided but it barely begins to compensate for all
the pro-Bush propaganda America has consumed recently. I felt so
relieved to hear some else voice how stupid, corrupt and completely
incapable George W Bush is and it was an eye opener to see how
influenced by Saudi Arabia, American politics is. Thank-you Michael.

The freedom we once knew, or thought we knew, is on its way out. You
should go see this movie so that later in your life you won't forget
that people used to be allowed to see things like this; to speak out in
public without fear of reprisal; and to vote. The power gripping Washington would like to take that all away from
you. Indeed they will take it all away from you just as soon as they
can, unless you vote against the Bush Administration--and tell your
friends to vote against them. But don't take my word for it---Go see this movie. No, I don't agree with all that Moore says, and no I wouldn't call this
pure documentary. But it gives a side of the story our press is to
afraid or unwilling to give us any longer. If you disagree with the
left, look at it as a way of finding out what makes us tick. You might
as well, you'll be seeing more of this before the 2004 election is

This is a highly emotional and important film. Michael Moore is a great
talent, and is is unique in his unwavering vision. That said, I thought
this was another great entry in his life's work. In fact, it was
inevitable that he would make this film, considering his remarks at the
Oscars, and it is a great breath of fresh air to watch his joyful and
relevant storytelling techniques.This is a story that needed to be told, considering the events that
have happened in the world since September 11th. I am sure that many
people have felt lost and not sure what in the world is going on. Moore
does a good job of voicing these frustrations. And like a good work of
art, this film leaves us with even more questions. Humor and sadness are mixed eloquently here. The humor provided solely
by President Bush and his comments and facial expressions. The sadness
comes from the footage of the carnage in Iraq and of the 9-11 footage.
The choice not to show the towers being hit, but to have the sound
playing was effective and possibly more emotional. If you are not a fan of Michael Moore, or of his politics, you will not
like this film, as it is an opinion driven film. A timely documentary,
footage flows together well. One scene involving the supporting
countries of the USA for the Iraq war, like Morocco, Romania, etc.
although amusing, could seem a little racist.

This is another example of the hype/sound bite/spin/sensationalism
mentality that seems to plague modern media, substance and accuracy
need not apply. This 'movie' uses people and emotion to push the
Moore's political agenda and is not even remotely a balanced view of
the current U.S. foreign policy or the Bush administration's strengths
or failures. Amazingly this drivel does a disservice to all sides of
the argument and victimizes many of the individuals 'interviewed'.The ultimate solution would be to lock Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore
in a cell together and then they will negate each other as they are
nothing more than two sides of the same coin, oh, and not to mention
the world would be a better place without the mindless propaganda that
is the most common product of either. Also, an original title would
have been a plus.I hope I am not wrong in believing that the U.S. public (or at least a
reasonable percentage of them) is/are capable of making informed
decisions about the events since 9/11. If not we as a people have
failed in the most basic responsibility of being a citizen of this
country and this world, and that is the responsibility to understand
both our country and the world we live in and support those that will
uphold the U.S. Constitution and will deal with foreign and domestic
issues with the welfare of the public as the primary goal.If this 'production' is the best that our media can produce then we are
indeed in trouble as we have lost the ability to see the forest for the
tree we just ran face first into.

'To speak his thought is every freeman's right, in peace and war, in
council and in fight.' Homer.In 2004, amid a loud 15-minutes standing ovation, 'Farenheit 9/11' got
the Best Documentary Film Award at the Cannes Film Festival,
exemplifying its overwhelming clout.Michel Moore, a man known for his earlier popular documentaries like
'Bowling for Columbine,' produced this devastating piece of 'truthful
account.' Narrated by the director, this is based on several
newspapers, magazine articles and books published on this controversial
subject. It is a critical analysis about America's war on terror,
precisely, how the nation was misguided by its leader, President George
W. Bush.The film opens with George W. Bush's much controversial election
victory (year 2000) over his rival Al Gore. In the following parts
unfolds the disgraceful way in which the Nation was betrayed by the
smartly manipulated campaigns by Bush and Co. This film thoroughly
examines the Bushes' and Saudi Royal family's business connection, long
before the September 11 terrorist attack. Soon after 11/9, the unseen
visual shows President Bush's reaction, in fact his inaction! We also
come to know that more than any valid reason oil interest was behind
the invasion of Iraq, in which America also faced heavy casualty.
Sarcastically, Moore tells how the 'freedom of war' deformed into
'business of war' in Bush-instigated Iraq war. A touching interview
with an American mother, who lost her son to the Iraq war, mournfully
shows the real loss of the common man. Showing its deceptive 'freedom
campaigns,' the ordinary people, mostly blacks and deprived, were
literally 'caught' by the US Government, the visual shows! In one
segment, through a smartly enacted drama, Moore reveals the
Congressmen's evasion of sending their own daughters or sons to
war-front! This gritty film unfolds misuse of government authorities to manipulate
the secret documents, popularly quoted in the media as 'sexing up' of
documents. The film also made possible for us to hear the voicesalong
with gruesome visualsof ordinary Iraqis and their sorrows. A well
presented, persuasively argued and highly regarded as unbiased  this
critically acclaimed documentary is a cherished treasure of free
speech.'Freedom lies in being bold.' Robert Frost

When I rented this film, I did not support Bush, I suspected many of
the things covered in this shocking documentary. The facts covered where
so shocking that I could not believe how MANY Americans have turned a
blind eye to such obvious things and still support Bush. The glaring
facts are astounding of what has and is happening to our country. When
Michael Moore proclaimed at the Oscars that the president had gotten us
into "a fictitious war", I did not quite know what he meant....Now I
can't believe how ignorant I was. This film is not just telling you why
Bush should not be re-elected, its informing you on what we are already
in and just how deep.

If you are a fan of this film, you need more education. This is a clear
attempt of Mr. Moore to edit and cut film to achieve his objectives.
And if you believe his nonsense, you need to put down you welfare check
and pick up a book or newspaper. Mr. Moore is an architect in his
attempt to get uneducated and uninformed people to believe his
nonsense. Nice try Mike. Rise above the NONSENSE. Achieve more then Mr. Moore believes you are
able. Read the FACTS. Make your OWN opinion. Employing his wry humor and irreverence to promote his left wing
agenda, director Michael Moore crusades against President Bush and the
War in his latest documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11. Like The Passion of the
Christ; the movie sparked controversy in the media before it ever hit
theaters. From finding a distributor after Disney dropped it to
contesting (and finally accepting) the MPAA's R rating to claims of
censorship, this is more than just the release of a movie -- it's a
campaign. In his opening and closing sequences, Moore uses footage of Bush and
his administration preparing for TV appearances; having makeup applied,
their hair combed, etc. If this is supposed to show that Bush is guilty
of trying to look presentable to the American public, no one is going
to accuse Michael Moore of hypocrisy. But the real purpose is to paint
Bush and the War as one big facade. Moore's conclusion is largely argued from fallacious appeals to
emotion, sure to fuel Democrats in their battle for the White House and
leave those looking for a well reasoned critique of Bush and current
events out in the cold. Fahrenheit 9/11 is repetitive, saturated with Moore posing questions in
voice-over and cutting to shots of Bush stumbling on answers. Bush has
set himself up for this, of course. With all of his struggling for
words and thoughtless pauses there is plenty to play with in the
editing room. But the approach feels much like a stand-up comedy
routine; you have the set up, you have the zinger, then the next one.
None of it is well integrated -- some of it self-contradictory -- and
Moore offers few answers to the problems he claims America faces. Footage that is meant to lead the viewer to a self-evident conclusion
often does not. At times it is misleading or bends the truth. There are
appeals to emotion, such as a mother in tears blaming Bush for her
son's death or Bush announcing the Iraq invasion inter cut with idyllic
shots of children flying kites in Iraq. Soldiers listen to explicit
heavy metal music while going into battle, the implications of which
are neither explored nor clear. Moore tries to demonstrate that the
world is not behind the war by listing only the insignificant countries
of the Coalition of the Willing -- while significant countries like the
United Kingdom are omitted. Still, Moore presents some interesting facts: the Bin Laden family
being allowed to leave the country after 9/11 when all other air
traffic was grounded, various intertwining of politics and business,
and Bush continuing his grade-school photo op for seven minutes after
the second plane hit the World Trade Center. Moore implies that the enemy is not militant Islam or Iraq; it is Bush,
an inept and bumbling president who keeps himself in power with his
color-coded terror alerts that trick Americans into thinking the nation
is at risk of annihilation. The fact that Bush is simultaneously
portrayed as a fool and as a master strategist of power is one of
Moore's many contradictions. Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't ask why America was attacked, and it barely
acknowledges that 9/11, the worst single attack on America in history,
was an act of war . What happened on that date -- and its causes -- are
conspicuously absent from Moore's movie. There is not a single frame of
the act that is the reason for Moore's movie: passenger planes hijacked
by religious fundamentalists crashing into the Twin Towers. But Moore
makes sure to display any collateral damage at the hands of Americans. Ultimately, Fahrenheit 9/11 is propaganda for the converted. Just as
Christians voted for their faith at the box office with Passion of the
Christ, so liberals now have an opportunity to have their ballots
counted too. But few minds will be changed. Even the legitimate
questions Moore poses are not answered or are overshadowed by his
emotional and deceptive tactics. The result is a monotonous smear
piece, not an honest opinion, which is why it fails as a documentary.

First of all let's get it on paper: Bush weren't the cleverest
president the USA has seen. Bush is not the most popular president in
the history of the USA (actually he must be the first President to have
been elected with minus votes). And the war in Iraq maybe wasn't as
just as first thought (let's face it: Saddam didn't have weapons of
mass destruction). The 3 point above Michael Moore looks on pretty
fine. But after that the documentary just evolves into a hate campaign
against George Bush. Between the lines Michael Moore says that George Bush more or less
planned or knew of  which is a lie. Let me present the evidence; let's
first go back in history. In the 1970ties president Nixon had to resign
because he ordered his people to break into the democrats' headquarters
in the Watergate hotel in Washington DC (the so-called
Watergate-scandal). It took a single man to bring down Nixon (deep
throat). Nixon fell because of a burglary  then think of it: Bush
should, if Michael Moore is right (which he isn't), have planned or
known of 9/11. Logically Bush didn't do any of these things, and
neither did any the American Government. That would have been exposed
very quickly  THAT IS A FACT. Al Quaida planned 9/11, and Al Quaida
planned it alone, that is a fact. If you believe that Bush or some one
other in the US-Government planned 9/11 you must logically also believe
in UFO's, Bigfoot and that Elvis lives  that is a fact. Michael Moore
insinuates that Bush and Osama Bin Laden worked together: Because CIA
helped Al Quaida, Taliban and Osama Bin Laden to beat the Russians in
Afghanistan in the 1980ties. Michael Moore does more or less say that
because they worked together against the Russians, then they must
logically still work together (feel free to laugh at Michael Moore's
lack of intelligence). Let me give all you people an historical example
that it is a stupid theory: in the star of the Second World War the
Russians and Germans worked together: they developed tanks and tactics
together at the Russian tank-school at Kazan, Russia. Later they worked
together to smash Poland, and do war crimes together. Then suddenly in
1941 Germany attacked Russia, in operation Barberrosa. Germany smashed
most of Russia until 1942/43, when the German 6th army was defeated at
Stalingrad. Then Russia went on the offensive and destroyed most of
Germany until they captured Berlin in 1945. If you believe in the
rhetoric of Michael Moore's documentary the Germans and Russians had
planned all this. Look how illogically this entire thing about Bush
planning 9/11 sounds? It is a lie. Only unintelligent people believe in
what Michael Moore says, that is an undeniable fact!! Now that we have
proved that Moore is wrong in most of his political bashing against the
Bush-administration, let us move on in the film. When he wants to make
the political point the US-army is bad and its soldier are stupid, and
its leaders stupid he uses a good, and well proved, propaganda
technique. He interviews the most stupid American soldiers (and you can
see that Moore (or some one else) have made the soldiers say it) and
then clips it together with gore footage of blown up, and probably,
innocent Iraqi civilians (mostly women and children). With that Moore
draws a contrast between the evil and dump US-soldiers and the weak and
innocent Iraqis  Michael would have had a great career in the 1930ties
Nazi Germany (his propaganda is very well made). Then he moves on in
his bashing of Bush. He interviews some journalist or self claimed
expert on Afghanistan. Michael Moore asks him how long it took for the
US-army to come to Afghanistan after 9/11  it a little under or over a
month for the regular army to take over Afghanistan. And then the two
men agree that if they were president they would be in Afghanistan
within a few hours. In that moment the whole documentary fell apart.
Michael Moore reveals that he doesn't know anything about military
tactics. The whole strategy about Afghanistan was NOT to just jump
right into Afghanistan  by then getting the whole country against the
USA. Secondly it was also a Special Forces war  THAT IS A FACT. All
the Special Forces linked up with the northern alliance (who did fight
against the Taliban), to fight the Taliban, and let the Afghans them
selves fight and take over the country. Thirdly: it takes time to
organize the Army, the Air Force and the Navy to make a strike and
invade a country on the other side of the world. Fourthly: it also took
time to secure all the diplomacy. Michael Moore ignores all these FACTS
deliberately  he knows that they did all they could to destroy Al
Quaida and capture Osama Bin Laden, of course he does. Moore ignores
all the evidence just to bash all that Bush stands for. He lies
deliberately to discriminate his political adversary (Bush), like
Joseph Goebbels did in Germany in the 1930ties. Michael Moore chooses
the evidence that fit his theory, and then he ignores all the piles of
evidence that speak against his bashing of Bush.But I must say that it is a very entertaining movie  though it is not
a documentary. It is not a documentary  that is a fact. Fahrenheit
9/11 should not be labelled as a "documentary" but as a funny and
political bashing of President Bush.My advice: watch it and laugh, just don't believe in anything it says.

The worst demagogic pile of crap I've ever seen. Full of manipulated
disinformation. Only a truly ignorant public could believe even a
fraction of the pseudo truths vomited at it in this awful, boring
movie. It is a genuine insult to intelligence and a perfect example of
subjectivity and bad taste.If Mr. Moore has such a leftish passion for cheap easy to chew concepts
maybe he should make his next documentary on how left wing parties
manipulate ignorant voters in Venezuela, Argentina, Spain or France.
This movie is a waste of time and a needless offense to more than half
the voters of the US.

OK, whoever you are that are deciding to watch this movie because some
one told you that it is accurate obviously have not watched the news
the paper or the internet. This movie is entirely democratic. It
portrays president bush as this mentally disturbed person who
fraternizes with the enemy. Which really if you think about it wouldn't
it leave over half America mentally disturbed? since we put him in
office? Anyway this movie shows you how easy and creative it is to
bleep out what bush really says and have him say something different. i
want to congregated the man who made this movie for making over half of
America think he is a total idiot. Oh and even though Bush is up there
with the worst presidents in America....he still deserves a fair
documentary.

First, let me tell you that I am a self-proclaimed Liberal Democrat.
Bearing that in mind, I am going to try to be as bipartisan as is
possible when examining content of this nature. Fahrenheit 9/11 opens
with a surreal, yet somehow familiar, image: a Gore victory party. Thus
begins part one of Fahrenheit 9/11, which shall be called "Election
2000." Moore presents lots of rarely-seen footage of the congress
floor, etc., thus providing a convincing argument that Bush did not, in
fact, win Election 2000 legitimately. Part one continues for 30
minutes, setting up the bulk of the film, which shall be called "The
Bush Presidency: Parts I and II." It's interesting that Moore devotes
30 minutes to the mere exposition of his film, which has nothing to do
with what the Bush administration has done with Dubya in office.
However, these 30 minutes set up the idea in the viewer's mind that
Bush is an illegitimate president who should never have been in office.
The film then begins its opening sequence, which plays on how much of
the presidency is just show. While the film is more of a series of
arguments against Bush (sort of a film version of his book, "Dude,
Where's My Country?"), these arguments are strung together in such a
way that anyone who sees this movie loses every shred of doubt that
Bush should not be president. The Bush presidency section of the film
is divided into two parts: pre-and immediate post-9/ 11, and the War in
Iraq, the latter being the most powerful part of the film. The bottom
line: this film leaves many indelible images in the viewer's mind
("Most people call you the elite, but I call you my base"), and
eliminates any notion that Bush is the right man for the job. 9/10

I'm not a conservative or liberal and I am definitely not a George Bush
fan..can't stand him. He just might be a murderous, profit hungry
dictator that this movie makes him out to be..either him or those
international money changers pulling his strings.There actually might have been potential here for a real documentary
film but this "documentary" is a piece of garbage. It's kinda like one
of those political commercials. Those ones where they play the dark
sinister music while they talk about candidate B's shortcomings (Bush
and neocons), then play the warm-fuzzy, cheerful music when they talk
about how good candidate A will be (various "victimized"
liberals)..imagine that for 2 hours straight.Michael Moore was, at no point, anything close to objective in this
film. He clearly chose to only use subjective sources that would
support what he was wanted and then presented them as "fact" with
absolutely no exceptions. If anything, I think he turned so many people
off, that he probably actually got more votes for Bush in the 2004
election.On a side note, another thing that bothers me with Moore (besides his
grotesque lack of physical conditioning) is that he consistently
portrays poor minorities as the victims of 'the man' in his films.
While seemingly on their side, this is simply passive racism. It
appears he wants to be this iconic Bill Clinton type by appearing to
understand minorities, yet holds them in disguised contempt. Do you
actually think he associates with this crowd in his personal life? He
is just another white charlatan trying to feed his own ego.

Spoilers ahead! This film is actually better than "Bowling for Columbine", but still a
far cry from Moore's debut into the big leagues of American
film-making, "Roger and Me." Moore does not hide his biases here, and
it is obvious from the get-go that this is a propaganda piece for
Moore's personal beliefs. This movie, in essence, was a rallying cry
for voters to not re-elect George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential
campaign; to this end, Moore presents relevant points about the selfish
interests of the Bush family, and how they jeopardize the interests of
the American people as a whole. As Moore makes his argument, he does
hit on very important points as to the dubious business interests of
the Bush administration.Whether one is a conservative or a liberal, one does see the dilemma
President Bush dealt with after the September 11 attacks, where he had
to juggle his family's ties to Saudi oil families--which includes Osama
bin Laden's clan--and his need to prosecute a war against terrorists
who are related to those business links. It is possible that it was not
easy for Bush to completely sever those links to the Saudi oil
families--which date back to his life as a fledgling businessman, and
Moore makes the argument that Bush made a very poor choice in placing
his business interests before his job as president. A president must
make sacrifices, even if that means excluding old friends and
colleagues, and Bush clearly was not able to do that. Whether the
president was complicit in a conspiracy to line the pockets of his
cronies at the expense of homeland security, however, is debatable, and
it seems a rather extreme extension of the idea that Bush made a poor
decision in continuing his business ties with the Saudis after 9/11.
Moore stretches this thesis quite thin, and one need not be blamed for
having doubts about Moore's credibility.Moore continues the ideas he espoused in "Bowling for Columbine" when
he describes the Homeland Security color-coded warning system as a ploy
to create a fearful and gullible American public that would acquiesce
to whatever schemes the president had already cooked up. Moore goes to
great lengths to argue that the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War
were not about fighting terrorists or disarming Saddam Hussein, but
merely get-rich-quick schemes for friends of the Bush family. It's one
thing to argue that Bush had a difficult time cutting ties to his old
business partners when he became president; it's quite another to cast
him as a Machiavellian schemer who cares not a whit for the life of the
American soldier in his great plan for personal profit. This argument
reeks of extreme cynicism, and Moore uses all of the tricks of the
movie-making trade to demonize the Bush administration as just another
tendril of the great octopus that constitutes the capitalist oligarchy.
There may actually be some validity to many of Moore's claims about
Bush, but one has to analyze his arguments carefully, and see if the
pieces of information he presents add up to a cabal of bourgeois
fat-cats who build an empire on the lives of soldiers. Above all else,
one must understand Moore's real agenda, and do independent research on
the information he presents. On the surface, Moore's whole thesis seems
too convoluted to be believable.The movie does do some good in showing the toll of the Iraq War. We see
wounded civilians and soldiers, and understand the bitterness of both
as they fight a war with rather nebulous motives. An interesting scene
includes the worries of a lone Oregon state trooper as he patrols the
coastline, lamenting the lack of funds from the federal government to
beef up law enforcement in case of a terrorist attack. This was one of
the most entertaining and believable scenes in the movie, and it
blatantly presents the troubles with regards to funding for the
incipient Homeland Security department. As was the case with "Bowling
for Columbine," Moore returns to Flint, Michigan, which, as of 2004,
was still economically depressed, and where many young people join the
army in the midst of crippling unemployment. This seemed like one of
the more intimate and heartfelt scenes of the movie, as it at least was
tied to Moore's home town.As a whole, the movie presents a radical left-wing perspective of the
Bush administration that not all movie goers will find convincing. As
with any of Moore's other movies, one must be highly critical of all
the information he presents and all the arguments he makes. Still, he
ties his loose bits of information into a coherent argument with a
large all-encompassing theme, which he could not do with "Bowling for
Columbine." This, at least, shows Moore's maturity as a director and
polemicist. If Moore is to continue to make polemic movies (which, I
suspect, will be his bread-and-butter for years to come), I hope he
continues to develop the techniques which have made "Fahrenheit 9/11"
one his most coherent movies to date.

All right, most people will say that this is a love-it-or-hate-it film
(possibly in line with what your party politics are). I cannot say I
either love it or hate it. It's a problematic film in many regards and
in other regards it's a triumph.Whaaaat? Let me explain. First of all, it's a gigantic floating
propaganda piece. There's no getting around that. Moore himself
admitted that he hoped the film would help get W. Bush out of office.
You know its motives, so you know going into the film that it will not
attempt to be balanced in any way (and you can be sure that it will
selectively forget information).But, it does do a few things right. First of all, it does what it wants
to do as a propaganda piece very well. It's successful at propaganda
(it will never change the minds of the convinced, but will do plenty to
help sway the minds of the unconvinced). Why? Because it brings all
that Moore has to say about the current administration to the people in
a very easily digestible way, complete with pop culture references.The other thing I have to respect about the film is how it does bring
many things to the public that isn't and wouldn't be brought to the
public in any major format. This includes the casualties of war, up
close and personal, not just on the United States side, but on the side
of the Iraqi people as well. There are many images in the film that
wouldn't get seen otherwise and I think it's important for Americans to
see these images. That is what we signed up for when our government
decided to head on into war.As I write this, I feel a little bit of anger--but not necessarily
towards the current administration, but towards humanity and war in
particular. You see, the part of Farenheit 9/11 that got to me had
nothing to do with all the conspiracy theories and bumbling about the
evil administration, but it was the horrors of war. And war is
horrible.But that's beside the point. The film has a lot of problems, especially
when it comes to being honest. It leaves out a lot of details. If
you're all fired up from the movie, take a little time out to read the
following article in Slate. Now Hitchens suffers from a lot of the same
confusing rhetoric that Moore himself suffers from, but it's a good
counterpoint (in being a anti-"political rant" and having plenty of
incomplete thoughts, just like Moore's film). It might cool you down a
little.Moore conjures up a lot of contradictions and conspiracy theories that
just served to offend my intellect. The part that got to me early on
was the insistence of the guilt of the entire family of Bin Ladens. I
mean, perhaps they might have some involvement, but we couldn't say for
certain that they did and yet Moore likes to hammer home how we let
these currently unsuspected individuals get away. Furthermore, he makes
a lot of implications about the connection between big business, Saudi
oil and the Bush family but none of them are ever validated. Just
implied. That doesn't make for a strong argument but Moore just
continues on as if his implication was fact.And like Moore's past films, he makes great use of editing. He leaves
out details that would detract from his point (see the Hitchens
article) and puts in random bits that, out of context, help aid his
point (all sorts of quotes of Bush saying the ridiculously stupid
things that we all know he tends to say). Not saying that he doesn't
have some good points, but it's just not the whole picture.That said, it is a propaganda piece and if I weren't such a
level-headed person, I might've been swept up in all the raging chaos
that Moore happily puts out. In that regard, Moore does quite a good
job. It's a propaganda piece of a very high order and it's light on the
fact and heavy on the opinion, but spins it all very well together.The last major problem I had with the film was that it was too long,
too confusing and too undisciplined, all characteristic of Moore. I
don't mind the stupid antics in front of the camera or the pop culture
inflections, but the thing that got to me was that he keeps putting
stuff in his films that it doesn't need. He doesn't need the Oregon
coast. He doesn't need to spend so much time in Flint. And if you're
going to make an implication, get ready to back it up with a harder
connection. And dangit, cut some stuff out, it would be far more
effective if it were shorter.Of course, perhaps I just wanted an anti-war film instead of a
political tract. As a personal statement (which might be just as
confused as the filmmaker) and a work of propaganda, it's quite
impressive. I'm glad he didn't replay the whole terrible incident of
9/11. It didn't convince me of anything, but I can imagine that it will
fire up the minds and hearts of all those whose first bite into
knowledge will be in this film. I just wish it didn't have to be done
this way. 6/10.Either way, I'll be happy if it gets viewers to think about voting. Now
I just hope they get their heads cleared up with some knowledge before
they get voting.

This is a real masterpiece from Michael Moore that lets you thinking
that's not possible but unfortunately it's the reality. The documentary
and testimonies show how young US people are thrown away for the iraq
(oil) war and all that for nothing and without any reasons!! Shame on
you George W. Bush!! What did we learn from the last WWI or WWII??? The
facts in this film are really unbelievable but we all have to open our
eyes. Mister Bush wants only thing: war. I hope very strong for the
moment that president or dictator George W. Bush will not be reelected.
It would be a big catastrophe for all the Americans and for all the
rest of the world if he should be voted again. Don't get me wrong; I
don't want to make politics but after I have all heard and seen about
this man I cannot trust him. The story as itself is written perhaps too
long. But Mister Moore did a great job with courage. Please, see it and
talk about with your friends. My wife and me vote: 6.75/10.

I am a Democrat, and I believe Bush needs to be removed from office,
but I hope I can post a critical, non-partisan look at this film and
how it has been fashioned.I just finished watching it. A lot of it was very hard to watch, and it
only increased my anger with the Bush administration. That said, I have
some criticisms:* Unlike with Bowling for Columbine, Moore does not want viewers of
this film to make up their own minds.* Moore doesn't always fight fairly. I thought his portrait of pre-war
Iraq was blatantly one-sided. He never mentions once that Iraq was a
dictatorship (in fact, he refers to it as a "sovereign nation"), so he
loses points for intellectual dishonesty.* He certainly gets a lot of footage out of Lila Lipscomb and her grief
over her dead son. I think he overdoes it, and I felt even sorrier for
her that her grief was being exploited for this film.* The film is too long; most of the last half-hour should have been
cut.* I didn't learn anything new, but then I've been following this
administration pretty closely.* I have to say that Michael Moore knows how to make a very persuasive
storyand he knows how to push an audience's buttons. This is agitprop of the
highest order.Aside from that, I think this film is right on target as far as facts
are concerned.

This film was fantastic! Michael Moore has done it again.Michael Moore
really has an ability to push your buttons! Fahrenheit 9/11 should move
anyone with a heart and soul! Fahrenheit 9/11 will make you
laugh,cry,and TICK YOU OFF! I viewed this movie three times and when it
was over the people in the audience applauded.Michael Moore got a
twenty minute standing ovation when his film was viewed at THE CANNES
FILM FESTIVAL at which he won he best picture award and deservedly so!
If people would leave their politics at the door and give this movie a
chance! It's informative and entertaining. Michael Moore does have a
wickedly delicious sense of humor.I highly recommend this GREAT
POLITICAL DOCUMENTARY! Linda V.

How frightening that 1984 has come to past, yet no-one has stood up to
object. The first 5 minutes of the film reminded me of news I had heard
before. Yet somehow, its significance had been erased. Modern living,
limitless choice, capitalism and to a larger extent, plain human
selfishness, are the dulling factors. Why think about such difficult
concepts when there are so many delightful distractions? Why energize a
single grey cell, let alone a finger, to fight for truth and justice?
Mr Moore is my kind of Superman to tackle this uncomfortable subject.
And despite the congratulatory voices, I suspect, his life has got a
lot more difficult since the film's success. But then that's the price
of freedom...the majority enjoys a deceptive freedom only because there
are those who had to sacrifice theirs.

I saw this awful piece of trash because it was supposed to have these
great battle scenes that compare to "Desert Storm". In a similar
Kubrickian twist, I'm equally as disappointed by this Docu as I was by
the comparison made between "Fahrenheit 911" and "Bowling for
Columbine" (an equally stupid overblown movie). OK, a comparison
between thousands of barely armed Iraqi rebels being slaughtered in the
hundreds by giant rolling balls of burning hay to fifty American dudes
wearing High graded armour is JUST NOT THERE.The problems run deeper. The "Terrorism" theme in this movie is overly
simplistic. OK, I'm an idealist, but if a documentary's gonna be
anything more than entertaining, if it's gonna have pretensions to
being relevant in some way to real life, as this movie does, it better
not have no meat on its bones. This movie's theme goes nowhere beyond
pure shining heart idealism that nobody could really believe in. IN
war, everybody gets dirty. I know that, everybody knows that, but this
movie of good guys vs. bad guys is NOT a great movie. It's just not.
It's just entertainment, and even on that level it fails because it's
too long and the acting of Michael Moore is terrible. Bombzers on this
one.

All documentaries have an agenda, and this is obviously the work of a
man who passionately believes that America (and the world) deserves a
better president than this one. Isn't Michael Moore allowed some beliefs? Isn't he allowed to explain
them to us, putting forward evidence, in a film that people choose to
pay money to see? Bush and his cronies certainly had a few "beliefs", many of them
totally without any supporting evidence (eg Saddam has WMDs, Saddam was
involved with 9/11 etc etc). And the result of Bush pushing his beliefs
is that tens of thousands of people are dead, and the world is a much
more dangerous place for all of us. Oh yes - and a few thousand
ultra-rich Americans have become even richer.I took the time to check out some of the websites attempting to refute
the arguments and evidence in the film, and this turned out to be quite
amusing. Not a good start when it turns out that the homepage of this
Kopel guy is covered in NRA stuff - obviously Moore got his goat with
"Bowling for Columbine". So the guy has an agenda too. Second thing that struck me was how the writer was wriggling and
whining about how - OK, Moore's facts are almost all accurate, but the
*impression* he gives is false. Wake Up! The world looks different
according to whether you are a gun-toting republican moron in a SUV, or
a "liberal".Anyway - great documentary, as partisan and one-sided as it has to be,
when it is attempting to redress some of the balance lost when the
Whitehouse was stolen from the American people.

This has to be one of the most eye opening docu films ever, exposing an
extremely controversial version of the what is really happening within
the Bush administration.This is an eye opening account of the events leading up to the horrific
events of 9/11, and the hidden dealing and surprising links between
business and the world of politics, all of which is driven by money. This movie really shocked me, I already had a base knowledge about the
topic, but this provided me with so much more information. To not watch
this film would shelter your understanding of an event which devastated
a world audience. PLASE WATCH THIS FILM!!!!

I can't think of a better way to spend two hours of my life than
watching Fahrenheit 9/11. The movie elicits a full range of emotions
from the viewer - from anger to laughter, from joy to heartbreak.
Michael Moore takes documentary-style cinematography to a new level
with this very well-done movie. The footage isn't kind to George W.
Bush, but Dubya should probably thank Michael Moore for not being
harder on him. It's obvious from what is presented that Mr. Moore could
have told and shown a lot more than he did. What he does show and tell
is very convincing and powerful. Every American citizen, regardless of
political persuasion should watch this movie.

Ooouch!!! Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 can't possibly help the current
Cheney/Bush administration in the upcoming election. The USA being a
50/50/50 country when it comes to voting, i.e. republican/democrats/non
voters I'd love to see the last third, the MTV Jackass-generation take this
movie to their hearts and minds and use their right to elect in the upcoming
election. You can make a difference and we all know the whole world is at
stake! Maybe then we could all have a safer world without oilthristy
warmongers like Cheney/Bush/Rumsfeld/Rice/Wolfowitz/Powell acting Police of
the World. Moore is heads on, again, when he shows the world why the US of A
is in no current fit to Police the World. Maybe the costs of Iraq could have
been better spent? Like into research for alternative fuels and a revoke of
the SUV-tax/ban? Maybe the administration should start caring about the
truth and not only about making themselves and their partners, like the Bin
Laden  family, richer and richer from oil and weapons? I applaud Michael
Moore for his efforts and wish he'd put Ficus into the coming election.

Everyone calls United States of America as the country that is a model
for democracy and freedom. But this movie makes you think twice. It
makes American people and not only, that maybe we shouldn't be so much
ignorant to the so called high power we shouldn't believe everything
they say... it's a war with ourself... Words are not enough. But you can see the power of words when used
properly... This is what American people and everyone else should think
about.It's all about money in their minds.I give a 10 to the director of the movie Michael Moore because he
managed to get a glimpse of the whole picture and show it to the
people.Just think about it.

It's only been out for less than a month, and already this film has created
an uproar the film industry rarely sees.  "Fahrenheit 9/11" is
writer/director Michael Moore's (he also produces) second megahit
documentary.  Last time, in "Bowling for Columbine", he examined the
gun-associated violence that America seems so addicted to.  Now he takes it
a few stories higher with this poke at "President" George W. Bush's time as
president.NOTE: If you didn't notice, I put "President" in quotation marks because I
cannot see why anyone would consider Bush and actual president.  I am a
Democrat and complete anti-Bush.  Anyone who can't stand to see Bush made
fun of should stop reading this right now.I walked into "Fahrenheit 9/11" with doubts about a few things.  First, I
wasn't sure about going to see a documentary in a theater.  I live in a
small town in an extremely small state, so seeing a documentary at the
movies is pretty much a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  Second, as much as I
completely despise our current so-called "president", I had by doubts about
Moore.  It sounded to me like he was taking it way too
far.When I came out of the theater, I was pretty much speechless, and
unfortunately, I still am.  The film was unbelievable.  I've seen some very
fine documentaries, but none compare to this film.  Michael Moore is the type of filmmaker than can keep anyone with an open
mind (or a Democrat with a closed mind) glued to the screen for as long as
he wants.  I was completely glued for the entire two hours and two minutes. 
Moore has the footage, and explains the events to us in a way that any
dimwit can understand.  He can be witty and hilarious, and yet also make us
extremely thoughtful.  To add to this, he throws in a soundtrack that will
sometimes make you laugh out loud at the irony of some of these
songs."Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of the greatest things I've ever seen, and
undoubtedly the best documentary.  Sometimes funny, sometimes tear-jerking,
and always thought-provoking, Michael Moore has made a masterpiece that is
simply unbelievable.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 by Michael Moore.

Michael Moore is a bear of a guy who with his scruffy face and ball cap has
the marvelous ability to get in people's faces without offending them.  The
class struggle message that is given in Roger and Me and Bowling for
Columbine, is brought home even stronger in F9-11.  The black-outs, the
cartoons, the implications, the strong evidence and old-boy networks, the
portrayal of George H.W. and his son, George W., as the center pins of these
vast money-networks is masterful.  You can accuse Michael Moore of being a
muck-raker, a potty-stirrer, a cynic, an America-hater or some other
unpleasant name but you cannot deny that he is an excellent film maker and
that he does his homework.  His recruitment efforts with the congressmen was
a master stroke and the looks on their faces when they realize this is not a
photo op is worth the price of admission in and of themselves.  I was
impressed how it starts with the purloined 2000 election and then builds up
to the network connections.  However, Michael's musings on George W.'s
reaction in the school room are less convincing:  Bush's face reveals real
shock.  The disengaged, lost expression is not necessarily one of a man
worried about having to cover his trail but one who is absolutely in compete
shock.  The contrasts of Bush with the more insidious Cheney, our not-so
beloved Veep, are likewise striking.  The ne'er-do well son who was spoiled
by his mother, who messed everything business opportunity he was endowed
with and is constantly bailed out by Daddy's pals winds up being president. 
He is not leadership nor is he shown to be the buffoon or village idiot that
most Liberals prefer to cast him as-- he is a caricature of the devious,
conniving, power-hungry plutocrat that his vice-president really is.  Bush
comes off not as a stupid bungler but as one who is being skillfully
manipulated by a much more egregious pilot, his own underling,
Cheney.Moore is very carefully not to make the mistake of past liberal follies who
attack wartime efforts.  Jane Fonda will never be allowed to forget her
moment of foolishness, sitting in a gun mount in Hanoi, thus earning forever
the nickname, Hanoi Jane."  Moore avoids this black splash by clearing
sympathizing with the troops and young people being pulled into a fracas
this clearly not of their making.There's little doubt there's a slant to this message.  The bias is set from
the get-go but it's well done and the argument build on the evidence is
damned hard to overlook.  True, he does get on a soap box for a few
instances but the oil-deal networks, the tell-tale military records and the
contradicting public declarations rather speak for themselves.It's very interesting to note that I attended a late showing that was quite
well attended by obviously working-class people who clapped enthusiastically
at the film's conclusion.Bravo, Michael.  Don't let up.

This, unsurprisingly, is the most political film I have ever seen. I was
expecting a intelligent and honest tale of reasons why Bush is a bad man
(the sentiment I won't cover here but I think any intelligent person will
reach the same conclusion). After a while and after several notable missing
facts (like the UK was in the collision, not a small fact) and also the
stretched use of context I started feeling the same as when I listen to some
shows on Air America, this is a purely one sided picture.This is not so much a documentary as a political broadcast for the
democrats.  Now it is clear Moore would love Bush to be removed from his
current position, something that the majority of the western world supports,
what I disagree with is the not so subtle way that Moore is using this film
to attempt to do that. The degree of omission, of sarcastic voice overs and
over playing of emotional cards (the distraught mother), the often very thin
connections and use of sympathy figures appear not to be aimed at those who
could fall for bushes war of fear.  In short this film is not a documentary, it's too biased and too opinionated
to fit into that category from my perspective. This is a political film made
by angry people to try and change things. The aim may or may not be mobile
but as a result as a film it really does suffer and from a British
perspective this film is as subtle as a 'Bush is an Idiot' T-shirt.  Six out
of ten.

I live in a french-speaking part of Switzerland, a country stifled by a
growing sense of it's own irrelevance, coupled with a small-town fear of
anything from outside it's own borders. Twenty years ago Switzerland was
Utopia, now it's just a washed-up backwater railing against the European
Union and foreigners, increasingly fueled by sub-Nazi nationalist hysteria -
just today the main headline in the regional tabloid centered on gypsy camps
causing chaos.So for a Swiss theater to be moved to the point of spontaneous applause by a
foreign film, especially an American one (American money is fine, but
Americans can only come here if they respect the Swiss and pick their litter
up), is a matter to be recorded.The film itself, well, I will keep it straight. This non-documentary,
political commentary has a lot going for it. Moore is on good form, the
story he has to tell is grippingly delivered in a supermarket tabloid kind
of way and the facts that he has to report are damning indeed. Nobody can
walk away from this without thinking about where the once mighty Empire is
going. Somebody else in one of the reviews drew a parallel with Rome, I
quite agree. The streets are not burning yet but it is on it's
way.The story to me hit home in that particular area - namely the the "haves,
and the have mores" as George W. Bush put it himself, and the rest of the
population who are dangerously cut off from so many things, school, jobs,
college, a future. One day they will rise.The rest of the movie, the amusing montages, the often overdone sentimental
sequences, lack focus because they lack counterpoints. Moore is never one to
let journalistic balance get in the way of a good story and here it is a
drawback. Happily enough he does pull off one excellent sequence, the 9/11
playback against a black screen. Just the noises of pain, horror and
shock.But the film does deserve to be piped into every American home and force fed
to every last citizen, preferably through the network of Fox
News.7 out of 10

Well, MM overdoes it as usual but still, he has a point.Seen from overseas, the US seem to have forgotten their motto: "land of
freedom and liberty". In France, 200 years ago, kings and dukes had it
all their way: their income was thousands of times higher than the
average and they more or less had all the political power. We made a
revolution, chopped all their heads off and wrote the charter of Human
Rights. The incredible thing with the US is that they were founded on
that ideal from the beginning. But today, all the money and political
power has gone to a happy few and as the kings of the past, they
increase their wealth by going at war. Free people of America, wake up
!

Thank god! Someone not afraid to stand up and be a True American Hero.
Right wings say he is distorting the truth, I'm sorry.......if he is
distorting the truth, then what was Bush and the rest of the "GANG"
doing in front of the UN and the world on TV? To many men, women &
children have died for oil. Enough is enough. Evil can not survive for
ever, the truth will prevail. Also, from a film makers stand point, the
film was clever, witty and to the point. Never lost the audience, never
lost its direction. Very smart to start in black on the trade center
buildings, the sounds were enough. Moore let the players tell the story
and the truth (Bush etc.). Again, the truth will prevail. Thank you Mr.
Moore.

I was in a state of shock for almost the entire movie.. in 5 minutes of
film I had felt angry, I had laughed, I had been utterly shocked and I
had grieved for all of the injured, the dead, the innocent victims of
the Bush Administration. I always knew the so called 'Free World' was
full of crooked, money hungry suits but I had no idea that the Almighty
dollar had become quite this Almighty. I had a co-worker about 2 years
ago from Pakistan, a VERY well mannered, well spoken but shy kid who
was a devout Muslim and even spent extra time teaching me about islam.
When he and I first met and had started talking as friends while at
work he told be about a pipeline, and that this pipeline was going to
mean a lot of money for a lot of high up people... and I had never
heard anything about this before... I knew Bush was into oil, there is
oil in this province and the running joke around here is that once Bush
catches on he'll be coming up to do a little regime change north of the
border. I had no idea the depth of the situation in the middle east
until I saw this movie. when they mentioned about the pipeline I was
like "Oh my God he was right" It is truly eye opening to see how one
sided the media coverage of 'The War on Terrorism' has truly been. The
times are indeed changing.. they're absolutely right.. we aren't safe,
and it's a bed that's been made for us by the very people we trust to
ensure our way of life.

I make no apologies for my politics or for the fact that I think Michael
Moore is a genius. He shows us the unsanitized aspects of the war that some
people would rather keep hidden (charred bodies hanging from the bridge,
screaming and suffering Iraqi civilians, our own soldiers revelling in the
destruction they've inflicted) and raises some serious questions about where
"our" president's loyalties lie and to whom the administration is beholden
(it ain't us!) Now, having said that, I am aware that Mr. Moore is a master
of the insinuation and perhaps false impression-without uttering a false
word-but then again, the footage speaks for itself. When George Bush stands
there and smugly tells the outrageously wealthy white-tie audience, "You're
my base" he is simply revealing himself for what he is and what he cares
about, and he needed no embellishment from Michael Moore. It is what it is,
folks. No matter what else you may think he is-activist, traitor,
whatever-Michael Moore is a superb storyteller who has shown a lot of growth
as a filmmaker and entertainer. Give 'em hell, Mike!

By the time it ended, I thought my head would explode trying to keep
straight the massive amount of "new" information that was presented.
Combined with the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, I don't
believe I've absorbed half of what was presented. I'll certainly have
to see it again, at least once more, to properly assimilate and absorb
it all.The sad truth of the matter is that so much of the information in the
movie is news to me. The point is well made that the media has, at the
very least, been lax in doing it's job to keep us informed. At the very
worst, one might believe that there is no longer a free press in
America. It brought to mind the lessons I learned about the press in
Germany before WWII. The images of the dead, the injured and the dieing in Iraq, coupled
with direct evidence of the deceit on the part of the administration
that led to this war, was devastating. One might try to blow it all off
as propaganda, but how to dismiss actual footage of Condoleezza Rice
and Colin Powell both emphatically saying that we KNOW Saddam Hussein
does not have Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)one day, and the exact
opposite another? How can one conclude anything less than deceit?But the image that will not leave my mind is that of the President
picking up a child's book and beginning to read it after being told of
the second plane hitting the World Trade Center on 9/11, that our
nation was under attack. Never mind Michael Moore's conclusions - you
have to wonder, "What was Bush thinking?" Knowing how I reacted to that event, how the people around me
responded, how people all across America and even around the world
reacted - with horror, concern and an urgent, burning desire to do
something - it's unbelievable that the President of the United States
chose to pick up a children's book and attempt to continue with his
photo-op. Yet we have actual footage of that very thing happening. For everyone who did not vote for Bush, this movie is horrible evidence
that their worst nightmare has come true. For anyone who did vote for
Bush, let me just remind you of the old saying he tries so hard to
remember in Fahrenheit 9/11. . . "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me
twice, shame on me." See this movie. If there are errors, point them out. If you disagree
with Michael Moore's conclusions, develop your own. If it confuses you,
read, learn, find out the truth, but SEE THIS MOVIE.

Michael Moore can be really preachy, however in the first half of this
movie he barely comments and just lets the news/media coverage/clips
tell the story. I found myself laughing because it was so comical, but
after a while, I realized I was laughing at reality and this upset me.
This war is really tragic and horrible to so many American families. I
think the troops over in Iraq are heroes. I think that if our
legislators are in favor of war, they should be prepared to send their
own sons and daughters. Why doesn't Mr. Bush encourage his daughters to
enlist if he feels so strongly about this war?

"Fahrenheit 9/11" is a must-see movie.  Whether you arepro-Bush or anti-Bush, you'll be fascinated by this filmfrom beginning to end.Before seeing "Fahrenheit 9/11," I had read countless reviews.  Bythe time I actually went to the theater, I had read about most of thekey scenes and clever dialog.  My suggestion is to stop readingreviews--as soon as you've finished this one--and go to a theaterand watch the film.Make up your own mind about Michael Moore, President Bush,and the man for whom you'll vote on November 2nd.

There are so many reasons to despise G Dub and Moore just hit a few of
them. My list goes on and on from there. His critics say the film is
full of lies but I'm not sure what statements they target. I am a news
hound and am very well informed but didn't have anything glare at me as
inaccurate. I'm sure there could be a few small inaccuracies but
certainly nothing huge.Please consider that only the American people are divided on this man,
the rest of the world detests him. In fact he is actually the most
hated man on earth. No surprise there. While our only ally in the war
appeared to be the British, the reality was that Tony Blair support
Bush and NOT the British people, they were and are overwhelmingly
against Bush and the war. Fox News ("Fair and Balanced" - yeah right)is
calling the French and now the BBC traitors, cowards and whatever else
because they bash Bush. Wise up Fox, the whole planet hates Bush and
for very good reasons.

No logical person can argue against the vast majority of the questions
Moore raises in the film. However, as usual the right can only attempt
to write off the film as a personal attack on Bush or an attack on the
presidency. I guess the right has forgotten that criticizing a leader
when they do a poor job, is the right thing to do and obligation of any
intelligent citizen. I'm so tired of the refusal of our society to sit
and think about the facts.Everyone seems to form an opinion just because they believe in a
certain political ideology. Before walking out of the movie or bashing
it, have glimmer of an answer to the important issues Moore raises. Not
because you are a democrat of a republican, but because I think WE MADE
A MISTAKE TRUSTING GEORGE BUSH AND WE SHOULD REALIZE THAT FACT AND QUIT
TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND OTHER AGENDAS!!!!! This was a great movie because
it brought up all the uncomfortable things we are responsible for by
going along with this administration. At a minimum we ignored the fact
the vast majority of the civilized world told us this war was wrong
long before we surprisingly "found out" there were no WMD's but we were
too incompetent to know what even the smallest and poorest countries of
the world knew. In all honesty we all strongly suspect something else
motivated our government and we still aren't quite sure what it was.
Moore gives the best explanation to date, we just don't want to admit
our leader lied and cheated us out of BILLIONS for the benefit of the
"haves and the have mores." Argue the facts, not if Moore likes Bush,
or you like Bush, or you like conservatives or liberals. I went out and
bought Dude, where's my country and it gave much more detail and
references Moore's claims. If you want to discredit the movie, attempt
to discredit the references for all the factual things that prove our
leader not only made mistakes, but used us. Moore editorialized. Our
media editorialized when they didn't chase down half of glaringly
hypocritical acts of our leader. In fact I saw much of the content of
this movie on a Canadian "60 minutes" equivalent well over a year ago.
I still wonder why none of our new networks picked up the story. I
guess it all boils down to the fact that those who research the facts
and love their country are going to have to side with Moore. Those who
may still love their country, but speak out of ignorance will side with
Bush.

I admit it, with me, Michael Moore was preaching to the converted.  I've got
all his books 
and seen all his movies.  I've read more than a few anti-Bush books.  So was
I surprised?
YES.
I was moved to tears and shocked by images of war that we never see in film
or TV.  The 
political trail of tears that Moore tracks is not a new one to a lot of
people, but he shows 
it comprehensively, and here's another shocker:  with RESTRAINT.  The peoplecomplaining about the facts as they appear in this truly great documentary
should be 
grateful that he doesn't hit us with a far bigger sledgehammer, which he
really could 
have.  He presents the facts and just when he can go in for the kill, he
more often than 
not, backs off and lets the viewer complete the thought.
Being told of the content vs. seeing it are two completely different
experiences, though.  
If you've already HEARD about Bush's "thousand-yard stare" in the seven
minutes after 
being told that the second Twin Tower had been hit by a plane, you haven't
SEEN it:  It's 
perhaps the most chilling thing in the whole film - and that's saying a
lot.
I understand that people are passionately split in this country, and I
understand why a 
lot of people hate Michael Moore.  But I must say, those who gave this film
a "1" in this 
forum almost certainly voted without seeing it.  I defy the most rabid
Republican to see 
this film and give it a "1".  And to those who voted "1" and did not see it:
 Make your 
vote count.  Go see it now.  And then see if you still hate it.  Seriously. 
You owe it to the 
rest of the imdb voters, but more importantly:  you owe it to
yourself.

*perchance might contain spoilers* Yes, see this movie, if anything to
tweek off the armor chestplated, shrieking and spasmodic GOP types, who
declare Hades and damnation upon all whose eyes fall upon this motion
picture. Michael Moore has hewed together an interesting, spell binding
and slam bang salute to democracy with this heavy fall out documentary.
If IL' daddy, the 41st President (papa of the current Bush) had to
shimmy down the pole from the ivory tower to personally attack Moore,
calling him: "...A slimeball...", then you know, this is a must see of
a pic. If he had just blown it off with the wave of a hand, then most
of us "proles" (i.e. dirty blue collared types) wouldn't have bothered,
I think. Moore mixes together in montage and audio a deeply probing
relationship between the Bush clan, American defense and intelligence
communities and those happy-go-lucky Saudi folks, for whom lots o' cash
has been passed around. Moore's wry (and I do mean as wry as a Saharin
desert) commentary, combine with words captured straight from the
horses mouth, after a fashion, make for an informative and compelling
saga from start to finish. I think you'll laugh (as I did), get uneasy
over the moribund foreign affairs (as I did) and take a long, long
second look at our current President (as I know I sure did and will do
with my vote come next ballot can collecting). This is heavy stuff, and
will make you think long and hard. Yes, you might even shed a tear or
two, yet the choice is clearly up to your own mind. Yes, you can
dismiss this as Anti-American pap or you can shake the pom-poms of
democracy; either way, you are thinking for yourself (hopefully),
without some obnoxious soundbite doing it for you. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Don't just look at this film as anti-Bush--which it certainly is. The point
here is that someone has stepped up for humanity. Moore makes a number of
points--in an entertaining fashion--that forces us to at least consider
what's transpired in this country over the past four years.
Moore's main points are:
1/ the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are joined at the hip because of
money
2/ the Administration's post 9-11/anti-terrorist campaign plays on scaring
the American public
3/ the war in Iraq was a put-up job
4/ It wasn't just the White House but also Congress and Big Media who  got
swept up in the "whee, we're going to war" excitement
5/ The decision to invade Iraq put our armed forces in harm's
way--unnecessarily
6/ Less fortunate people in our society wind up suffering the most in
wartime 
Enough of the term paper points. Moore handles all this with news
clips--some pretty shocking, Dragnet bits, good music and a tone that
carries a very simple theme--does any of this seem fair? If Bush comes off
like a clown, then when addressing a dinner of fat cats, he might try
avoiding statements like, "Some call you the elite. I call you my
base."
The spirit of the 60's lives and his name is Michael Moore.

"What I want to know is-where is the footage of American soldiers wounded
with arms and legs blown off in Iraq? Wouldn't that be a good anti-war
statement for Moore to use? He doesn't... Don't believe the mis-information.
Don't bother seeing this film."I just wanted to comment on this particular piece of mis-information from
jonann2 in Florida.  If (s)he had actually seen the film (s)he would be
aware that Moore uses numerous scenes of US soldiers that have lost limbs
and worse in Iraq.I really don't understand the determination of so many "reviewers" to
discredit this film without having seen it, and the duplicitous attempts to
convince others not to see it by pretending they have.  It's a more damning
indictment of the US political system than anything Moore says in Fahrenheit
9/11.

Regardless of your political persuasion, it helps to see what Michael
Moore has to say. His movies usually attempt to champion the average
Joe, and this one does it exceptionally well. It is artful, engaging,
entertaining and often upsetting. I did not learn much new information
from this film, but I can't wait to share it with my friends and family
who are not politically minded. I have read several negative reviews of
this film, but all these reviews take issue with its politics. I have
yet to see anyone claim that the film is not entertaining.If you want to see a film that makes you think, this is the one. I also
recommend another documentary that is out on video, unrelated to the
election or to Bush: The Fog of War. While this documentary is not as
engaging as Fahrenheit 911 or as appealing to a wide audience, it is a
good second- runner up.

It's amusing to read the ravings of these dittoheads condemning a movie they
haven't even seen.  The language used resembles the facist ideology used by
the Nazi's to take power in Germany. Read your history, while we still have
books. Look up the facts, while we still have access to them. The Saudi's do
own the Bush Family. All Michael Moore has done is compile information that
has been around for years, it's nothing new. All these dittoheads do is
listen to 10 second soundbites from Rush, O'Reilly, and Hannity, and take
those as facts and not do the research, which is the right of every
dittohead. I have every intention of practicing and defending my First
Amendment right, and supporting Michael Moore on June 21...while we still
have a constitution...And what's up about giving the movie an "R"
rating????

The best film of the year! Michael Moore should prepare for another
Oscar win. He could be the most important filmmaker of our time. I hear
his next documentary is on Tony Blair. It should be Ronald Reagan. We
need to know the truth about Reagan and hopefully CBS won't censor the
filmmakers freedom of speech like they did on the best cable movie of
the year - The Reagans.Censorship is unamerican. This documentary is a must see and can't be
more important during this political season. The only spoiler here is
the truth about Bush and the illegal "election" which assigned him the
president job.

After reading Shadow's comments I became enraged that someone who
claims to speak about what our great country represents, so rigidly
defines questioning ones' government as "treason". Perhaps he should go
back in time to Old England and serve a king in a world where having an
opinion was a travesty. It's freedoms like our ability to question
governmental decisions like Mr. Bush's that makes our country great.
Not our military might or loud mouth uninformed citizens like shadow.
This is an insightful film that reveals truths that most conservatives
would rather sweep under the mat. At times Mr. Moore pushes past the
realm of documentary, but instead of documenting, Mr. Moore is a
columnist, a commentator on the American situation -- something that is
sadly real. If we all followed Shadow's advice, closed our eyes to any
truths and simply did as our government was told -- we'd be living
behind that wall that Mr. Reagan demanded be torn down all those years
ago. I for one am a happy citizen that I have the right to create
material that questions my government, no matter what the international
climate and perhaps even more so in a time where we're living in a
world so unstable. Kudos to Mr. Moore for this brave work.

I will start off by saying that I understand Michael Moore does, at
times, use methods that are not very suitable for proving his points.
This is something I think we can all agree on. With that being said, I
believe that what Michael Moore is attempting to do for our country is
more patriotic than anyone who supports the governments actions at all
costs. I have seen people post things about this film being treason and
it has amazed me. For someone to be so lost in the responsibilities of
a citizen of the US to criticize someone for trying to make this
country a better place is sickening. Shadow1995 is a prime example of
this, read his posts and you will be amazed. The role of the US citizen is to question the government in order to
make it better. WE as a nation should respect Michael Moore's attempt
at doing just this and checking the government. His methods are not
always great but his intentions are good and for this he is a better
citizen than many of us. The American government is flawed and the
leaders are as well. This movie is an attempt to enlighten the world
about the corruption that exists and try to rally people together in
order to change it.

Mr. Moore has become one of the best known guerilla documentary filmmakers
of this time. Currently, his name and antics are pretty much well known and
his films has put quite a bit of change in his pocket. (I see the USA Show
'60 Minutes' in his future!) Does this take the heart out of being a
documentary filmmaker? Does this skew his perception? Does it push an
agenda? Yes and No. And because that is what it is, that's what makes him a
captivating documentary filmmaker.It took a lot of guts to go against the grain and do a documentary on a USA
sitting President who wasn't involved in a sex scandal. I mean, that would
be more entertaining -- wouldn't it? Well, what the USA has now is a sitting
President that can't fall back on that, but one who has much of the country
questioning everything about him -- his decisions, his administration,
everything except sex. This movie starts at the alleged defining moment of
George W. Bush's Presidency, the 9/11 Disaster, and tries to make George W.
Bush's subsequent actions make sense of it all.Moore is doing what he does best. Laying it out warts and all. I know the
supporters of George W. Bush, et al  will be upset at the portrayals, I
would imagine just as the supporters of Bill Clinton were when they
discovered he lied about his sexual encounters.  I for one, don't see Moore
as liberal or conservative. In his films he hasn't been kind to neither USA
Democrat or Republican. He IS issue oriented and George W. Bush is the issue
here.If you're open minded, you'll love this piece of work for what it is -- It
is, fine documentary work. If you are a die hard, "Bush never did any wrong"
kinda person, stay clear away from this film. You'll hate it. You'll think
the "liberals" are coming to get ya, and ruin the moral fiber of the USA.
That's sad because I think everyone should see this film and agree on one
thing: The world is in trouble and if we don't face facts and make positive changes
soon, game over.From 'Roger and Me' up to this one, that message is as clear as day. I am
looking forward to his next documentary of the Health Care
System.

I happen to be in the oil business, and all the rubbish that Moore
spouts about how that business works is just that -- rubbish.He is shocked -- just shocked -- that there is actually a connection
between Americans in the oil business and Saudis in the oil business.If he knew anything about that business, he would realize how silly he
is being.Americans were the ones who discovered oil in the Middle East, told the
Arabs how to get it out of the ground, and then provided the technology
needed to do so.We have never failed to pay for a single drop of oil that we have
gotten from the Middle East (not that we get that much; most of our
foreign oil comes from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela.) The Arabs (and Persians in Iran) are still heavily dependent on
American know-how in order to efficiently find and produce the oil that
they sell.In fact, they are so incapable of doing much of anything themselves
that Iraq -- for instance -- has no refineries and has to ship all of
its oil abroad in order to get it turned into gasoline before it is
shipped back to Iraq for use by Iraqi drivers.So when people scream about how "corrupt" it is that American companies
like Halliburton or Bechtel are involved in oil exploration and
production in the Middle East, it is clear that they have failed to
educate themselves.There are only three companies that I am aware that are capable of
pulling off really big energy infrastructure projects in the Middle
East: Halliburton, Bechtel and Bin Laden Group.My own small California-based natural gas exploration and production
company depends on a handful of key companies without whom we could not
function. Halliburton is one of them. Does that make me a buddy of Dick
Cheney? I've never even met the man.And if anyone remembers the end of the first Gulf War when Saddam
Hussein torched Kuwait's oil wells, those who were paying attention
will remember that there was just one small company that was qualified
to safely put out those raging oil well fires.That company was an American company.You would think that the liberals and environmentalists (of which I
trust Moore is one) would award a gold medal to a company that, at
great risk to its employees' life and limb, stopped an ecological
disaster in its tracks.But no.It is so obvious that Moore's agenda is to portray oil companies, big
business, Republicans, Christians, white people, Western Civilization,
etc., as The Great Satan, and everyone else as the poor little victims
of said Great Satan.Thus, as someone else pointed out here, Moore says nothing about how
evil Saddam Hussein was to his own people.He couldn't care less about Israeli men, women and children being blown
up by Palestinian suicide bombers.Oil just dropped from $140 a barrel to $70. When it was $140, the liberals and Democrats screamed about price
fixing by Big Oil.Well, if they are right that the oil companies run the world, why did
the price come down? Um. Er. Never mind.Another amusing but pathetic example of left-wing distortion is the
periodic raging by liberals and Democrats about Iraqi oil not paying
for the Iraq war.Well, let's see.12 years of UN sanctions and Saddam Hussein diverting what little money
Iraq got for its oil into building palaces and buying weapons instead
of exploring for new oil and maintaining Iraq's oil infrastructure left
Iraq's oil industry a big mess that will take years to fix.And that mess hasn't been helped by the constant attacks on oil
infrastructure during the U.S. occupation by disgruntled Sunnis and Al
Qaeda-related terrorists.But why concern oneself with such details when all one has to do is say
"Bush = Big Oil = Saudis = Bin Laden = 9/11 = AmeriKKKa = rich
Republicans = Great Satan?"By the way, for those who believe that the rich do not pay their fair
share in taxes, here are the facts: The IRS will be happy to tell you that -- even after the Bush tax cuts
-- the top 5% of income-earners pay over a third of all federal income
taxes collected, the top 10% pay over half, and the bottom third pay
practically nothing while benefiting from all of the goods and services
paid for by the rich (who also give generously to charity.) Moore and his left-wing cabal (and I include Obama, Nancy Pelosi and
Harry Reid here) want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.But that goose won't wait around to be killed.The rich -- who risk their capital to create companies that create jobs
for Americans and generate the wealth that is taxed and transferred to
the needy -- will simply leave this country, taking their companies,
jobs and money with them.What a sorry pass we have come to as a culture and a nation that so
many supposedly intelligent and well-informed people take "Fahrenheit
9/11" seriously.The sixties left-wing radicals whose Communist revolution failed have
taken over the media, the universities, the music industry, the fine
arts establishment and Hollywood. We are doomed.

This is a review written in Aug. 2008 to see how it has stood up. A few obvious things stand out. The first is that this is not a
documentary, if a documentary is something that documents reality. This
is a propaganda piece for the left. The second obvious thing is the method. The method is to present
assumptions as the truth and move quickly on. This is a propaganda
technique that is particularly effective in film, TV and radio, because
you are quickly on to the next thing and there is no time to pause to
reflect. If this film had been presented in print with pictures and
text, the reader might stop and say to him/herself, "Let me think this
over. He just showed me pictures of Bush looking and saying a bunch of
stupid things, then he showed me pictures of some radicals looking
harmless and pleasant. He might be picking the worst of Bush and the
best of the radicals. He just talked about the cutbacks for State
police as if it were the fault of Bush. But if this is State police
what has this to do with the Federal government? He seems to be biased
and this is not conclusive data." Also these media are much better that printed media at projecting
emotion. See a woman cry over her lost son and there is no way you can
be unaffected. Emotion is not something that should be disregarded. We
are all emotional beings, but when it becomes the only governing
element, when reason is excluded, then it becomes dangerous and a tool
of propaganda. Moore is not the first to use these techniques. Probably the first was
D. W. Griffith in "The Birth of a Nation." Moore owes more to Griffith
then he would probably like to acknowledge.The film may masterpiece of propaganda, but does he make any real
points? Most of what he presents is innuendo, supposition, and only
half the story, but he does make some valid points. He asks the
question why the Ben Laden family was allowed to leave the U S without
being questioned. That is a good one. He also criticizes Bush for 7
minutes of inaction after he was informed that the US was under attack.
Although 7 minutes is not a long time, it does seem to be a weakness in
leadership.That is the historical significance of this film? Moore's film was timed to attack the Bush re-election campaign. He
didn't succeed, Bush got elected by a significant majority. I recall a
Democratic commentator writing a column after the election titled "The
People Have Spoken - the Bastards." However, Moore did succeed in
energizing the left and the successful attack on Bush and the
Republicans after the election took its lead from this film. Is Moore now vindicated? His main points: 1. Bush stole the 2000 election 2. He is somehow connected and protecting the Saudis and the Ben Laden
family. 3. He used the attack to create an atmosphere of fear which would get
him elected in 04 4. He went into Iraq for no reason unless it was to create that
atmosphere of fear in order to get re-elected. 1. Even when the film was released there was an answer to this. On Nov
12, 2001 the New York Times (not a fan of Bush) published an article
called "Study of Disputed Florida Ballots Finds Justices Did Not Cast
the Deciding Vote" (available on line). An independent Consortium of
the Press had conducted a Florida recount. Bush still would have won if
the recount Gore wanted had been done. But statewide, there were
approximately 300,000 votes that were not counted because they were
dimpled or because the voter had voted for two candidates. Using
different standards of evaluating these votes, Gore would have won or
Bush would have won - all by less than 500 votes. With 300,000 votes that are unable to be determined and victory margins
of less that four or five thousandths of one percent, there is no real
conclusion possible. We will never know what the result true result
would have been. However, this data was available to Michael Moore and
he chose to paint the situation in a much different light. Clearly a
bias and distortion of the truth. The same failing that he accuses Bush
of having.2. No resolution on this one either. We can guess and conjecture on
this but there is no hard evidence other than allowing the Saudis and
the Ben Laden family to leave, and there may be explanations for that,
such as attempting to establish a much needed friendly state in the
Middle East to combat the terrorists.3. Again no resolution, no real evidence of intent or not. 4. As reported by one disaffected Bush staffer, the Bush administration
pressured the CIA to come up with evidence of weapons of mass
destruction. They did, and it was not correct. The staffer's data has
not been verified but assuming it is true, this does not absolve the
CIA of giving the government false or poorly documented information.
Since that time, there has been evidence found of chemical weapons of
mass destruction and nuclear programs, however, the evidence is that
they did exist at one time but were removed. There is also satellite
evidence of caravans going from these sites to Syria just before the
attack. Are these weapons now in Syria? Again it is inconclusive.So the vindication is not there for Michael, but neither is it there
for Bush. Perhaps the real lesson from watching this film in 2008 is in
how much of a shadow game politics really is; how little is definite
and how much is propaganda - on both sides.

First I am a Conservative and I still support President Bush. Most
people do not understand why I even saw this movie. Well first I
believe in being open minded and I am very open minded to opposing
views. I look at both sides before I make my opinion. Second I thought
Bowling for Columbine was a great movie so I figured why not see this.Michael Moore desperately tries to pass this off as fact when the truth
is it is not fact. In fact the truth is Michael Moore more times then
not draws his own conclusion. This is very apparent when it comes to
the economy, NCLB, the tax cuts etc. The truth is the economy is in
good shape two years later, funding for education is rapidly
increasing, the Bush tax cuts were not for the rich and the jobs being
made are not low paying jobs most are decent paying jobs. Moore then
tries to say Bush lied about Iraq. Now there is actually a lot of
evidence to support this and a lot of evidence to support Bush I guess
it depends on where you stand. I am not going to say what I think
because I think we should investigate the matter. I believe Americans
deserve the truth. Moore also tries to say Bush spends more time on
vacation then he does working. The fact is Bush can work outside of
Washington. I mean honestly do you think this country can afford to
have our commander and chief take a month long vacation? NO. Chances
are he was working more times then he was relaxing. He probably did
vacation a little but worked more times then not. Moore also tries to
say Bush did nothing moments after 9/11 and then tries to say Bush was
reading the book backwards. Both are lies and have been proved to be
lies by witnesses who were there that day. Moore also tries to pin all
of 9/11 on Bush. I am not saying Bush is not to blame but as Dick
Morris said eight months of Bush doing nothing pales in comparison to
eight years of Clinton doing nothing. Moore also tries to say Bush is
failing the War on Terror. Yes Bush could probably do more to find OBL
but we are currently involved in two fronts in this War on Terror. Iraq
and Afghanistan. Iraq is naturally where we are diverting most of our
attention to currently but are still fighting terrorists in Afghanistan
as well. Moore also tries to say that Saddam had absolutely no ties to
Al Qaeda. The truth is Saddam had some ties to Al Qaeda he did not have
a huge relationship but the admin. never really said that. Saddam did
however have extensive ties to other terrorist oganizations in the
Middle East. So really either way the War on Terror has been and always
was part of the War on Terror. Bush is doing exactly what he said he
was going to do after 9/11. I guess Democrats and Michael Moore simply
forget what Bush said.The fact is this is a decent movie that should not be taken seriously.
Do the research.

Well, absolutely a great documentary movie. At the beginning funny, to
the end sad...because it is just sad towards where the mankind is
heading.I think that from a more global perspective it is like this: You have a
free market system (capitalism) on one side and democracy as a
framework for actions, decision making and governing.THE PROBLEM: 1. Capitalism supporting individualism in which free
individuals are maximizing their benefits and thus not caring about
maximization of other peoples benefits.2. Democracy with its basic idea of making decisions in favor of most
of the people (majority) and thus not caring about maximizing benefits
of particular individuals.So, by nature of both systems, it is clear they are contradictory. The
politicians (people who are supposed to serve to the rest of the
population) in democracy are meant to make decisions in favor of
majority. But in the conditions of free market economy they don't care
about decisions beneficial to others than THEM. Well, there is some
other thing to be considered - politicians try to get elected for the
next term - and thus try to act like they are doing decisions in favor
of majority of the people.So putting together free market economy and democracy could just not
work fairly for the majority of the people. But there has not been
"invented" a more fair and appropriate political and economic system
that would actually work.P.S.: Russia and Eastern Europe is a perfect example what happens if
free market economy is understood as anarchy market economy and
democracy is understood only as "moneycracy".

Before seeing this movie, I read both "Stupid White Men" and "Dude,
Where's My Country" so I thought I knew what to expect. Much of the
content of this film comes from those two books and is a savage
indictment of George W Bush and of the cronies and other corporate
crooks in his administration. Coming from where I do, it is almost
inconceivable that so many people in positions of power can be allowed
to wield that power in the administration in ways that can so obviously
be self-serving.Commencing with the manner in which the election result of 2000 was
stolen by Bush Co and progressing from there to corporate crime, to
lies and deceit about the reasons for waging a false and dishonest war
in Iraq, this film is relentless in its pursuit of Bush and what he has
done to the American people and to the rest of the world in the last
four years.The part of the film which I personally found most distressing were the
images of the poor people of Iraq who are made to suffer because of the
lies that Bush Co told the world in the period leading up to the
invasion. My country is a member of the so-called "Coalition of the
Willing" but I am here to tell you that 70 per cent of Australians were
opposed to an invasion of Iraq, perhaps because we were sceptical of
the lies we were told about WMDs and the need to free the people (and
not the real reason, the oil) in Iraq.The personal toll on the Iraqi people which has resulted from the
invasion is graphically and tragically captured in Michael Moore's
wonderful film and that alone should be enough to make any feeling
human being question the wisdom of being there. God knows how many
innocent Iraqi citizens have been killed and injured since the invasion
began. I hate to think.It is also tragic that the number of Western troops killed and injured
grows by the day. However, the mounting death and injury toll of US
troops might eventually rouse the American people to demand action to
force the administration in Washington to get the Hell out of Iraq. It
worked (eventually) in Vietnam and, make no mistake, Iraq will become
another Vietnam, involving the US in a long, ferocious and ultimately
unwinable war. Hopefully, somewhere along the line the Australian
Government will come to the necessary conclusion and withdraw our
troops from Iraq sooner rather than later - yes, Australia has troops
there too.I give this film 9 out of 10 for its uncompromising illustration of
Bush as the puppet and the fool that he is.In closing, although appalled by the content of the film and by the
actions of the Bush administration, I take heart from the words of
Mohandas K Gandhi who is said to have made an observation to the effect
that there have always been tyrants but that eventually they all fall
from power. Think of Bonaparte, Hitler, Mussolini, Idi Amin, Pol Pot
and Milosevic. Add GWB to that list and you can see where I'm going.Final comment - well done Mike. Your country and the rest of the world
need you.

Michael Moore has really outdone himself this time, a complete
eye-opener for me. I would like to say that this is one of the most
informative movies that I have ever seen. I would recommend that
everyone in the world,especially Americans, see this movie. Michael
Moore's view on what happened to the United States after September 11th
seems more truthful than that of some of our top political leaders.
There is a serious threat to America. To our peace, our freedom, our
very way of life. And this threat is not ours alone, but belongs to the
entire world. This is not an issue of religion or race or even
politics. It's all about money.

Let me first say that I am a moderate. All I can say about this film is
that while some of the information presented may be a bit far fetched
in the presentation, Mooore definitely makes you question this
administration and Bush's long standing ties to the Saudis. I also
found the 7 minute stare and the "conveniently" manipulated Texas Air
Guard records to be of interest. Particularly the blacked out pilot's
name that is discovered to be the eventual money manager of the bin
Laden family in Texas.It is easy to see why some Bush supporters find this movie
"uncomfortable" I might add. Bush is portrayed in the film as a
shallow, inarticulate person a persona that his supporters fight very
hard, but unsuccessfully try to overcome. Everyone liberal,
conservative, moderate, etc., should see this film, it is a great eye
opener.8 out of 10.

i thought this was an excellent film, well crafted and its story told
quite well.moore let's much of the actual film footage speak for itself. i am
amazed at how he was able to gather all the film footage and piece it
all together.the way he narrated was simply ingenious!regardless of one's political slant, moore succeeds in stirring the
hearts and minds of his viewers.he most definitely deserved the top award at the cannes film festival.
and i too give him credit for having the courage to create such a film
that publicly shows us his views, as well as the views of a lot of
Americans out there.and in a nation that prides itself of freedom and every individual's
right of self-expression, isn't this what it's all about?10/10

This documentary should have been done by "FrontLine". They at least take
import information that shows what kind of guy Bush is and shows it in (at
least on the surface) not so biased way. This movie's slant was almost as
hokey as those UFO shows that interview people with their faces lit up from
below for that "spooky" look.Moore makes some very good points. 
1) Why were all of Bin Ladens family flown out of the country on
9/13?
2) Why do we have less soldiers in Afghanistan looking for the guy who we
know has a link to 9/11 (Bin Laden) than we have cops in
Manhattan?
3) Why does this administration censor his military history to hide his
relationship with Bath?
4) The links between the Arabs and the Bush's is really strong (Although the
video of the Bush's shaking hand with a lot of Arabs is dumb. I'm sure you
could get video of any President shaking hands with Arabs a lot. WE BUY A
LOT OF THEIR OIL).
5) It is pretty obvious that Bush used 9/11 to invade IRAQ. Multiple people
that worked for Bush say they were talking about it before
9/11.Even though it is really slanted, you can watch this and evaluate the fats
for yourself and come out hating Bush anyway, so why did have to slant it so
hard. It just give the critics of the movie ammo.I liked the "Bowling for Columbine" movie better. 8/10 (8 instead of 10
because of the "spooky" conspiracy narration).BTW Bush is an idiot.

I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 this weekend. Great movie. Bush should be
nominated for best comedic performance.It is obvious we're in there for monetary gain, not eliminating the
evil that is hiding along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border. The movie
is flawed in places, no doubt.It tells essential truths about the presidential administration who
exploited 9/11 for political gain and our soldiers who are paying the
price.I encourage you all to see it.Oh, and how about CIA Director George Tenet, who conveniently resigned
his job yesterday. Who is the next G.W.H. Bush crony on tap?

Regardless of your take on this movie, there is no denying that it is
an extremely well done film. While I was not a big fan of Bowling for
Columbine because of its many inaccuracies and vilification of Charlton
Heston, I believe that this movie is Moore's best work, and quite
possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.While you may disagree with his opinions and assumptions, you cannot
argue with the facts. You cannot argue that Dubya sat there for 7
minutes with a look of fear on his face on 9/11, not knowing what to do
without someone telling him. That alone is enough for me to vote Kerry
this November. How can you defend him continuing to sit there knowing
that we were under attack? As Quentin Tarantino said, this is the first
movie ever made to defend an Oscar acceptance speech, and it makes one
hell of a case.I sincerely hope that people come out of this movie with a renewed
sense of patriotism not seen since 9/11, and get out there and spread
the message and get people to vote.While Moore may be a bit crazed and speculate to the point of
absurdity, it doesn't take away from the truth. Go out and see this
movie and do something the Bush administration doesn't want you to do:
Think for yourself.

Why do I say this? Because I have never cried or laughed so hard in all
my life. To move one emotionally; that is the measure of a great film.
What else should I say about this? Brilliant. Yes, and: I went in this
movie already a disbeliever in the Bush monarchy, and went out of this
film a firm believer that all Republicans are greed ridden evil doers
and the source of most of the suffering in the world. So far,
everything I have heard or seen or debated with others had made me only
believe that more. Please try to convince me otherwise. I am a
scientist and appreciated logic. I see the world with a different slant
now. I see it more as a war of the haves against the have nots. The
haves are those so engrossed in the game of greed that they want
nothing more than to get more by squeezing the true providers of their
wealth: the working poor of the world. I see the United states as a
oligarchical republic and definitely not a democratic nation that seeks
to spread its system of enslavement via debt and industrialization to
countries around the world by any means possible. Hey you detractors of
this film: First see it, then comment on it. I don't want to hear any
more "critics of the critic." Why are you afraid to criticize the
government? Michael Moore is the biggest patriot and a total hero. May
this film save lives... Thank you Michael Moore for opening my eyes.

How politically correct of most of the critics to acclaim a movie like
this... How liberal, how modern. Well, I am not going to be any of
those things, I am actually going to be very old fashioned and tell the
truth, however unpopular that may make me in today's 'good', 'hear no
evil, see no evil', post modern, neo-socialist western society.I understand partisan politics, I understand militant proselytizing,
but such an enormous amount of so blatant lies all in one place is
truly difficult to find elsewhere. But, strangely enough, it is exactly
what made such a mediocre filmmaker (to put it mildly) like Michael
Moore stand out from the crowd, and even become famous in a way. In
today's society, anything goes, the end justified the means, all under
the shining banner of democracy and freedom of speech. Sadly though,
Michael Moore and his disciples are far less democratic and less
freedom loving than most of the people they criticize and label as
murderers and war profiteers. Like all of his comrades and predecessors
in countries where socialism (communism) had a chance to govern and
prove itself, Mr. Moore and his followers have shown to be themselves
completely intolerant to anything and anybody who doesn't entirely
agree with their distorted view of the world.Well done Mr. Moore, keep it up, the French certainly have some more
awards they can give you for films like this!

It's actually made for liberals , Bush haters, and also those who think
it's appropriate to enmesh satire with tragedy. Shame on you Mr. Moore
for toiling with the sensitivities of those who lost loved ones in wars
and terrorist actions. Exploitation never ceases to exist especially a
film-maker wanting to make some major bucks. How can you sleep at
night, Mr. Moore? Why do this? I admit I never knew a lot about what
was in this pseudo-documentary. The Bush family being in cahouts with
Saudis, because of their oil interests was news to me. And if it's true
so be it. Does it relate to 9/11 and the actions that led up to the
terrorist attacks and the main culprit, Osama Bin Laden? I'm not sure
and I doubt it. It's interesting information to know, but Moore's
reasoning for rationalizing the Bush Administration' accountability for
terrorism is foggy and confused. Moore brings some insight on Bush's
family fortune and their history in the oil business, but it doesn't
quite convince me.The beginning of the film with Bush's inaugural being lambasted by
protesters on the streets was chaotic. I know many people don't care
for Bush, but there have been other unpopular presidents as well.Moore also attempts to make a syllogism with Bush providing the Bin
Laden family refuge and flying them out of the country. In it he says
Clinton would have been burned if he flew Timothy McVeigh's family out
of the country. That is an idiotic comparison since McVeigh's family
couldn't have possibly posed a threat after Tomothy's bombing. It's not
a worthy argument.But Moore also makes some other dubious arguments which are too
numerous to mention.The war footage is a bit graphic and it's tragic to see people maimed,
burned and slaughtered. As in any war in history, there are always
casualties and deaths.This film is effective for those who are biased and obviously those who
adamantly wish to believe Mr. Moore and his efforts. But it is hard to
stomach exploitation and the methodology under Mr. Moore's style.

Political activist Michael Moore has certainly honed his craft as a
documentary filmmaker and concurrently raised a firestorm of extreme
feelings about the Bush administration. Since receiving boos at last
year's Academy Awards ceremony for calling Bush a "fictitious
President" who was leading us to a "fictitious war", he has fast become
a touchstone not only for the agitated left but for all those who have
felt increasingly alienated by the imperial hubris of the current
administration. Whether you like this film or vehemently hate it will
depend far less on the quality of the film-making (which by the way, is
excellent) as it does on how you plan to vote in November's election.
Ignore this film at your own risk, as it is a powerful indictment
creatively executed. Better to view it and discuss its implications, as
it won't go away thanks to Moore's constant and savvy media campaign.
He was fully aware of the coming firestorm and given his history, I'm
sure he welcomes it as his agenda leaves no room for historical context
or an analysis of facts or debate. It's a brilliant blame game and
frankly quite a convincing one at that. As a filmmaker, Moore has
become far less didactic than he was with "Roger and Me" or even
"Bowling for Columbine". Instead, he has become an almost subtle
alarmist and a first-rate filmmaker.Mercifully, Moore is far less visible in this documentary as his
first-person rantings and attempts at ridicule can get tiresome even if
the treatment was deserved. The one exception is his admittedly
humorous attempt at the end of the film to get U.S. Congressmen to
enlist their children for Iraq on their way to work. Otherwise, his
presence is felt in the calm yet pointed narration. The film starts
with a compelling argument for the illegitimacy of Bush's election.
This was actually the most revealing sequence, as we go beyond the chad
controversy into all the odd connections and situations that appeared
jerry-rigged to ensure Bush's victory. I dare anyone to watch this part
and justify not voting in the next election. Moore then goes into the
murky, under-the-table relationship between the Bush and the bin Laden
clans before he became President, especially the suspicious way the FBI
decided to fly the entire American side of the bin Laden family out of
the U.S. two days after 9/11 without holding any of them for
questioning. Whether his conjecture about the triangulation among the
Saudis, the Bushes and oil is true or not, it has credibility in the
way it is presented. This sequence catapults us into the grim reality
of war, showing dying Americans and Iraqis, and speaking with a few of
the thousands of casualties at U.S. hospitals who feel betrayed. There
is a shocking sequence that follows a Christmas eve interrogation of a
seemingly unsuspicious Iraqi family, as well as another one with U.S.
troops ridiculing hooded detainees near Samara (sadly paralleling the
humiliations that occurred at Abu Ghraib). Finally, Moore does bring
the conflict home with a sadness quite familiar to anyone with
recollections of Vietnam, when the heretofore devoted military
supporter Lila Lipscomb reads a letter from her son who was killed in
Iraq, noting: "He got us here for nothing whatsoever." It is probably
the most predictable moment in the film but also its most personal.What resonates most in the film are images most of us never got to see
on the news, like the series of African-American congressional members
being turned away for their pleas of invalidating the Florida election
results; or Marine recruiters manipulating small-town, low-income teens
in Flint; or most infamous, the time-lapsed seven minutes as a slightly
perturbed Bush reads "The Pet Goat" in front of a Florida kindergarten
class. Praise or vilify Michael Moore, but it is difficult to deny that
much of what he does claim is at minimum strangely coincidental and at
worst immoral. A perfect example in the film is the passing of the U.S.
Patriot Act, where at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act
had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on
the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but
which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances
that they were essential to fighting terrorism. It is hard to stomach
that kind of logic.Moore has grown significantly since "Roger and Me" in 1989 and not just
around the waistline. Believe it or not, this is not the most damning
film that he has done, just the most publicized and certainly the best
timed in light of the upcoming Presidential election. Moore places less
emphasis on espousing his opinions this time around and more on facts,
figures, quotes and actual footage from real events that actually make
the viewers decide for themselves. The film is not perfect, not nearly,
but it is important viewing. My recommendation is to see this film,
then read John O'Neill's grudge-laden "Unfit for Command: Swift Boat
Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry" and see which one you find least
objectionable to lead the country.

Although, yes, it is biased in my opinion, I thought Michael Moore did
a great job. I was impressed with his views and he stated the facts
clearly. He did some great editing and showed the heart breaks of the
families who have lost someone in the 9-11 attacks or the war on
Terrorism. The film itself is great to watch. Especially if you are not
for George W. Bush being president. Than this is the film for you. *And
me* :D As a film, I have to say that it was good to watch. I'm not sure
if all the facts are true. There is always another side to the story.
That's the only thing that I found as a flaw in the film. Other than
that, I would recommend this film.9/10

'Fahrenheit 9/11' is Michael Moore's best documentary so far. Not because it
is anti-Bush but because it is better made than his others. We see less of
Moore himself with his usual way of dealing things. Here he lets his
material speak for itself. May be you are not convinced by the things he
shows us but at least you must find some things very odd.I myself, like most Europeans, am not a very big fan of George W. Bush and
admittedly that makes sure you will like this documentary, probably no
matter what. The usual easy tricks of Moore are here, simply showing us how
incompetent and inarticulate Bush is at times. People in the audience
laughed and I was thinking that even when you are not really against Bush
you must realize how stupid he can look to other people. A president must
realize that there are cameras looking at you a lot of the time. When you
address all nations to do everything to stop terrorist killers it is simply
stupid to talk about your own golf game a second later. Bush's final words
in this movie, when he gets mixed up with the words of an old saying from
Texas, or was it Tennessee, could have been the entire documentary. It seems
that when Bush have think for himself he is incapable of doing so. I believe
this is true, maybe because I do not like Bush, but Moore gives us so much
material that proves this. Again, at least you must think he acts a little
odd at times.The documentary itself starts with Bush's election, tells us what he failed
to do in the following months and arrives at 9/11. At the time the airplanes
hit the buildings Bush was reading a book to children in Florida. The way
Bush looks when he is informed that a second plane hit the WTC shows us
again a man that has no idea what to do next. He sits there for seven whole
minutes. Of course, what do you do in a situation like that? I wouldn't know
either but I have no responsibilities for an entire nation. I could get up
and say goodbye to the children. At least I would have my people around me
again.After 9/11 Moore shows us how members of the Bin Laden-family were allowed
to leave the country, how Bush used 9/11 to push its agenda until he arrives
at the invasion of Iraq. We see some new footage, sometimes pretty shocking
(maybe you have to agree with the R-rating at times), of the war and then
Moore changes into personal stories. We have a woman who lost her son in
Iraq, injured soldiers, and one that will never go back there. Although the
personal stories give faces to the points Moore makes they were the least
interesting. Especially the woman, although it is a sad story, is too much
used to make his point.Not that I cared much. Especially the first half of the documentary where
Moore shows us one coincidence after another, for me believable enough, for
others probably just coincidence, is strong and very well made. The second
half will have an effect on a lot of people, I guess many Americans as well.
Again, even if you do not agree with its content, you see that 'Fahrenheit'
is better than 'Roger & Me' and 'Bowling for Columbine'. The less Moore you
see the more images are enough to make a point. That can't be a bad
thing.

I live in Texas, north of Dallas. A few of us finally got to see
Fahrenheit 9/11 today. Although we usually get all the new releases the
first week out...this film was not being shown within 248 miles of us
till this weekend (at least at Cinemark, which the vast majority of
theaters around here are. Wonder why??? I will admit up front that I
consider myself an independent but I usually vote republican. That's
right. I voted for George, both of them. I was in a minority at the
beginning of the Iraq war. I was one of few in this area against it. I
didn't feel that we should stretch our forces thinly between Afganistan
and Iraq...and although I did believe Sadam had WMD, I didn't think he
was joined with Al-Queda. After the war began however, I did feel
strongly that we needed to be behind our forces...I was a teenager
during the Vietnam war and have a very suspicious nature when it comes
to our government. I don't know what I expected to feel about this
film....but I certainly did not expect to feel....like an ostrich. What
was I doing....where the heck was I when the news stopped reporting and
began editing, what Americans would be privy to????????? I, like a lot
of viewers around me, had tears streaming down my face.......for all of
us.....for our soldiers, the way they felt at the beginning of the war
about what they were doing (so like Vietnam)....then to hear the ones
that have been over there for a while. They don't understand why we are
hated....or they have such guilt about what they are doing/have done.
Tears for the Iraqi people and what they are living/dying through.
Tears because I now understand why a vast majority of the arabic world
hates us. I can't say that I was really surprised at the content, not
the Bushes and oil, saudis, the lies, not even a senate who would not
stand for the people/country they are supposed to represent. I love
America...I love the way Americans
are....giving-caring-strong-dependable.I am so ashamed.....not of America....of myself....for allowing myself
to be quietly lured/coaxed into an invasion of Iraq (Sadam is no worse
than the Chinese, Tienemen square?, the North Koreans, the Saudis)
...ashamed of myself for allowing our freedom to be whittled away in
the Patriot Act....ashamed of myself for not demanding loudly for years
to eliminate our dependency on oil. There are so many other forms of
energy and let's face it....we have let big oil and big government talk
us out of demanding what's best for us Americans and not the
politicians (both parties) and big oil. God help us all if the foreign
money invested in our country is pulled out!!!!!!!!!! God help us all
if our deficit is called....our dollar could look like the
peso!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was not a movie, it was totally, evil propaganda. It never ceases
to amaze me what some people will do to make a buck. Michael Moore
shows no respect for anyone or anything. This film reminds me of what
an abusive husband would do to portray his wife the victim of his
beatings to keep her submissive. That no one who would associate with
her because she is some kind of vile scum. This film seems like it was
made by some sourpuss terrorist. It's hard to believe that any one who
has enjoyed the freedoms of life in these United States could ever lie
and try to get so many to believe the lie, like he was Satan himself.
Whatever happened to making uplifting films of hope and courage?

"Fahrenheit 9/11" is one of those films, like Michael Moore's earlier
"Bowling for Columbine" and Oliver Stone's "JFK," that polarizes
audiences along political lines. If you like George W. Bush, chances
are you'll hate "Fahrenheit 9/11;" if you can't stand Bush, you'll
probably love it. There's little room for middle ground in today's
sharply divided American electorate.Many critics of "Fahrenheit 9/11" claim the film is factually
inaccurate. However, very few details of the film have actually been
refuted. What really angers many about this film is its premise: that
Bush ignored the threat of terror before the tragedy of September 11,
2001, and then used the attacks as an excuse to advance a radical
right-wing agenda that included an ill-advised invasion of Iraq (which
had no involvement in the September 11 bombings).Not exactly a cut-and-dried documentary, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is more of
an essay film that relies on documentary footage to underscore Moore's
hypothesis. The footage and facts are expertly woven into a devastating
indictment of Bush's policies. You may disagree with the way Moore
connects the dots, but his evidence does come from the public record
(including actual quotes from Bush and his administration).For all the political weight it carries, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is
entertaining as heck. Most of the comedy occurs in the film's first
half. There are montages of Bush vacationing to (you guessed it) the
Go-Go's "Vacation" and of Bush Sr. schmoozing with Saudis to REM's
"Shiny Happy People." Moore examines the "Coalition of the Willing,"
finding that our allies include "superpowers" like Pulau, The
Netherlands, and Costa Rica. (My favorite line: "Afghanistan? ...Oh,
yeah. They had an army. OUR army!") Moore also milks the Patriot Act
for laughs, hijacking an ice cream truck to announce its provisions to
members of Congress (who admit they didn't actually read it).As events draw nearer to the invasion of Iraq, the tone grows darker,
and Moore gradually dispenses with humor in order to focus on the story
of military mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son goes to serve in the war.
Moore's delicate, sensitive handling of Lipscomb's heartbreaking story
belies his reputation for guerrilla film-making.Near the end of the film, Moore offers this profound observation about
our troops: "They serve so that we don't have to. They offer to give up
their lives so that we can be free. It is, remarkably, their gift to
us. And all they ask for in return is that we never send them into
harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they ever trust us
again?" Unfortunately, conservatives refused to address this and other
valid questions raised by "Fahrenheit 9/11", instead focusing on
discrediting Moore himself. They must have felt vindicated when Bush
narrowly won reelection in 2004. But the election results do not
invalidate the hypothesis of Moore's film. Rather, as our troops remain
in Iraq, as American casualties mount, and as Bush's rationale for war
fades into obscurity, "Fahrenheit 9/11" remains all too relevant.

To simply put it about this "movie". Anyone with a camera can follow
anyone around for two weeks and use the footage to make them look like
the greatest thing in the world or the biggest pile of crap that ever
lived. You don't have to be a Republican or supporter of Bush to see
all the lies and fabrication in this film.All Moore does is take some half truths and mold them in a way to
support is over liberal egomaniacle beliefs. It is nothing more than
shameful propaganda. He failed in his attempt to get Bush out of the
Whitehouse this past election. The only thing he was successful at was
making a butt load of money off a country full of idiots who saw this a
legitimate documentary.

Michael Moore's documentary on the Bush administration. It accuses him
of being an idiot (he is) and not knowing how to handle the horrific
events of 9/11. The events of 9/11 are not shown--the screen is black
and you HEAR what happened. It's just terrifying. Bush didn't take
correct action--he started a war with Iraq where (he said) the
organization that did 9/11 was hiding. Step by step it shows that Bush
is an utter moron and his administration is basically using fear of
terrorist attacks for an assault on civil rights (like the Patriots
Act). Obviously I hate Bush so my review is biased, but this movie raises a
lot of questions about the war and Bush that just have no easy answers.
I do think Michael Moore goes a LITTLE too far at times (I have trouble
believing that ALL republicans are for the war) but most of the time
he's right on target. There's also the devastating sequence in which he
talks to a woman whose son was killed in the war. She reads his final
letter and visits the White House to find out why her son was killed.
Some say this is exploitation--that's just ridiculous! This woman
agreed to be filmed and knew what she was doing. Moore is just trying
to show us the anger and anguish of parents whose sons or daughters
were killed in Iraq. It also interviews the soldiers over there who
wonder themselves why they are there and want to get out.A shattering, disturbing documentary. EVERYONE (regardless of political
choice) should see this. A very important film.

The TV guide described this film as "an examination of President Bush's
policies in Iraq," but it's not really an examination. It's more like a
vivisection.Anyway, it lives up to its reputation as an inflammatory piece of
propaganda. It's probably Michael Moore's least witty, least
egocentric, most preachy, and most angry film so far.As propaganda it's not perfect. Too much time is spent on a grieving
family in Flint, Michigan. The married couple who lost their son is
perfect for engaging our sympathies, large and of mixed race, and the
mother's patriotism is shown as unshaken. When she hangs up the flag
she never lets it touch the ground and she is proud that she has a
military family, and yet there is so much time spent with her that it
borders on tastelessness. She carries so much moral authority that we
don't need to see much of her.And Moore uses the usual ironic techniques to puff up the already
obvious phoniness of the big business types dining on huge trays of
Vorspeise and drinking wine and boasting about how much money there is
to be made out of the oil fields, alternating with shots of bloodied
bodies.And his argument is, as in Bowling for Columbine, confused. Yes, the
Bush family is close to the Saudi power brokers, but was the war really
just about oil? Moore may be misunderestimating the dimensions of
Bush's ego. It is GLAMOROUS to be a war president and Bush has reveled
in it. (That faux warrior's jump suit, etc.) To be sure, oil probably
has something to do with it, what with Halliburton's involvement and
all. Does anyone really believe that we would be in Iraq today if,
instead of sitting on top of the world's second largest oil reserves,
its chief source of income were its jute crop? That's just about all the weaknesses I'd like to point out. It's a
powerful film. Moore is known for his delicate touch in arranging and
editing the events we see, so I doubt that the class of poor high
schoolers he interviews in Flint were chosen at random. It's probably
theater. But is it any different from the audiences that were so
carefully screened and assembled for Bush's "town hall meetings" while
he was touring the country pitching his plan to revamp Social Security? This is a real punch in the snot locker for Bush and his supporters.
(Not that it will change anyone's mind.) It's probably underhanded and
full of indemonstrable insinuations. But I don't care. Bush deserves
it. He's got Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly, Novack, and all of Fox News
and much of the rest of the media on his side, plus an able team of
media manipulators. Who've the REST of the country got? Al Franken? And I'm perfectly willing to disregard the likelihood of legerdemain
anyway. I no longer care if this administration is in bed with the
Saudis or if oil were the chief reason for the invasion of Iraq. (One
general uses the word "invasion" in a speech and immediately corrects
it to "liberation.") Moore's message comes across as both intact and
honorable. The last words of his narration are "wars should never be
fought unless they are absolutely necessary." Hear, hear, Mike, our
lumpy proletarian.

My girlfriend and I saw this movie together and were appalled! We could
not believe what we were seeing. Is it any wonder that Vietnam is such
an issue? This administration is hauntingly familiar to those of use
unfortunate enough to live through the Nixon years. Michael Moore is
shining the light that Woodward and Bernstein blinded Nixon with, and
illuminating this crook (Bush) for who he is! 2 hips and a hooray for
Michael Moore!! The Republican attacks on this "true" American can be
assimilated to ghestapo tactics. Our so called president (he wasn't
elected by the people) hides his ineptitude by slurring and bashing to
divert attention. American lives is exchange for higher profits. It's
absolutely disgusting!

This documentary sums up what I've been trying to explain to people all
along. Although I didn't have all the details surrounding Bush's
motives, I knew they weren't good. This documentary had me crying one
minute and extremely angry the next. Being an average citizen, I feel
so helpless against Bush and hope that everyone comes together to
"take" our country back. We don't have ownership in America, the
Saudi's do and that's quite scary. Another suspicion I've had all along
is that the Gas Price epidemic is just another tactic by Bush to get
the people behind him and allow him (I say him, because his pockets
would be fattened) to drill for oil in Alaska. I'm so angry that our
men and women are dying for nothing more than the control of the oil in
Iraq. That's all it's been and that's all it ever will be. Why on earth
did we ever stop our hunt for Osama Bin Laden? I honestly feel in my
heart that had George W. not gotten into office, our The Towers and the
Pentagon would never have been bombed. I believe it was something
personal aimed at the Bush family and America merely got caught in the
cross fire. When the election of Gore was reversed, I literally cried
because I knew that our lives as we knew them were no longer going to
be the same with him in office.GET OUT THERE AND VOTE! THE COUNTRY IS IN GRAVE TROUBLE IF BUSH GETS
ELECTED AGAIN!!

this movie is very important. 911 is a good journalist work, which make
one ask important questions on many social issues, including the role
of mass media in our life, lie in politics as a tool, etc. This movie
is not only about the USA and war in Iraq, but concern the whole modern
society regardless of country and ruling person. Can we provide the
democracy by using force? Is it a right thing to start war with other
country which is not attacking? Is it OK if president/prime minister is
incompetent? The movie benefits from good editorial work, effectively
using short video-clips to debate and proof the statements.

This film exposes Bush for what he really is. Moore has the guts to say
what he means, and won't let Bush or his cronies to censor it like they
have done to so much of the media.Bush and his people have been working hard at protecting their image,
but Moore makes it his mission to show the public what they are really
doing.Get ready, though. You will be shocked by some things you see(others
are horribly obvious) in this documentary. Moore takes the time to
worry about the little guy, the guy Bush continues to ignore. Moore
takes the time to think about the families of the soldiers in Iraq.If you support Bush, watch this and see what you think of him after.If you don't, watch this. You'll agree with it.

The single most important film of 2004 and a must-be nominee for
Academy Award Best Picture and Best Director. Michael Moore has caught
the Bush Administration with its pants down around its knees. Watching
George Bush sit in a classroom reading "My Pet Goat" while people were
jumping to their deaths from the windows of the Trade Center Towers,
speaks volume about the AWOL-in-Chief's chickenhawk heart. Learning of
the close ties to the Bush family, the Neocons, and the Saudi Royal
family chills the heart, especially as you witness the Bin Laden family
members evac from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia while all other aircraft was
grounded without being interviewed by the FBI, CIA or any alphabet!
Realization that no one in Congress had time to read the Patriot Act
before signing it infuriates to the bone. The biggest eye-openers come
at the end when you get to watch senator after senator side-step
signing their own children up to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan while
Marine recruiters comb the poorer shopping malls recruiting from the
ranks of the most economically depressed and poorest neighborhoods.
Michael Moore put on film facts that others have avoided and done so in
a manner that entertains and informs.

In the newly coined sub-genre of docu-film , Moore presents his
ideology on Bush, the war in Iraq, weapons of mass destruction and the
American citizens in the midst of it all. In a detailed gathering of
information, footage and statistics this really does offer compelling
viewing for audience. Think again about politics, money and power.
Think again about those we put our trust into. A must see 'film' for
anyone who was against the act of war, and must see film for anyone who
wants to enlighten themselves to the hard truths that have been
carefully concealed from the public for so long. This 'film' will have
you laughing, gasping in disbelief and seething all in one. As always
great credit to Moore who creates a film, constructed in such a manner
that it portrays all views of the argument, from the lowly patriotic
American citizens, the American troops, peace supporters and the heads
of politics themselves. Although it obviously suggests we make our own
conclusions, you will be left in no doubt who is to blame. Not for the
squeamish.

Before seeing the movie I thought George W was a creepy guy from Texas.
A born-again Christian who, until 911, was lost in the role of
President. Now I've seen it, and I'm disgusted with the whole
administration, Moore does a great job of getting access to people,
documents, etc., and makes the point that George "I'm a war president"
Bush is a corrupt and incompetent leader. What struck me was Bush's cavalier attitude towards Iraq and its
people.Everyone should see this movie and make a choice, do I vote for
President Bush, who cheated to get in to the White House and was never
elected, and never once revealed his A-rab conquering ways in his
platform leading up to the 2000 election. He didn't even have the
mandate for war!!Remember America, Canadians love you and something is awfully wrong
when a man like Bush is elected. Don't make the same mistake twice,
vote for anyone but Bush.

POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Michael Moore takes on a powerplay in his latest documentary.The
laureated director of BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE(Oscar winner) and Canadian
BACON is on a mission with FAHRENHEIT 9/11.His mission is to throw
George W. Bush and his war bound posse out of the White House.The way
that Moore does this is mostly very good and very emotional but it
isn't always like that. Especially the assembled shots of Bush are not
that convincing,although we all know what kind of liar he is(or else,if
he believes everything he says,he really dumb).For instance the scene
in which names Saddam and Bin Laden is not powerful,the quotes are
taken from different press conferences and speeches.Still,the fact is
that Bush dragged the world in an unjust war.Let's talk about the positive things of this documentary cause there
are lots. Moore's use of old Movies and Television series to make his
point is hilarious(especially DRAGNET and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN)and the
moments he picks for this technique are perfect. The build up in the
movie is also great,it stretches out the four years of Bush's
presidency that means from the Coup d'Etat in Florida in 2000 until the
9/11 hearings and the prison abuse in 2004.After a great intro the
opening credits appear after which the screen turns black as we hear
the terror in the voices of the New York citizens on that dreadful day
in September,it looked very much like Kubrick's overture of 2001: A
SPACE ODYSSEY.The documentary then reveals the connections between the
Bush family & clan and the Bin Laden family.This is where the film
slows down a little but it strikes back with fierce images of the war
in Iraq,from mutilated Iraqi bodies because of the bombings to the
burned American bodies hanging upside on a bridge.The scene in which an
Iraqi woman is at her most desolate is very frightening. The last half
hour is probably the strongest part.A patriotic family who have also
believed in America's power the change the world in a positive way come
to minds after their son is killed in Iraq.The scene where the mother
reads a letter of her son is heartbreaking,the fact that a lot of
American soldiers have lost their believe in their President is
striking.The scene in which recruiters of the US Army are convincing(or
brainwashing)poor and chanceless young Americans is almost
sickening,this entire scene takes place in Moore's hometown of
Flint,Michigan.The passionate way in which Moore portrays his wasted
town is real in every sense.Only poor,mostly black,people enlist for
the army is the message.This is strengthened in the sequence in which
Moore tries to convince members of Congress to send out their children
to Iraq,this diabolical scene shows the false situation in the USA. On
of the last scenes of the movie is the one in which the mother of the
killed soldier goes to Washington to visit the White House,she breaks
out in tears when a Republican woman tells her to blame Al Qaeda for
her son's death.The mother replies:"They don't understand what it's
like,I didn't either until my son died". What counts for the Republican
passing lady counts also for Bush and for the members of congress and
senate.FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is not as great or powerful as BOWLING FOR
COLUMBINE,the humor of that documentary is far better than
FAHRENHEIT.One could ask the question whether this latest addition to
the Moore legacy will be remembered in years to come.The fact that it
won The Palme d'Or is probably because of the fact that after this fact
it would be shown in American theaters.Moore shows the public what they already know,but it is necessary
viewing since a lot was extinguished by the Government. It still
baffles me that Bush is so much in the race for President,I really
don't understand that.Sure,Kerry isn't a charismatic person but Bush is
a liar and a man who caused the death of almost a thousand US
troops,not to mention the Iraqi casualties. When is America coming to
it's sense?Let's hope before November 2nd. 9/10Today,as I wrote this comment,more than 125 people died in Iraq because
of a bombing at a police station.

I didn't think this movie was depressing at all. It made me feel GOOD. It
made me feel VALIDATED. It made me feel like there are more people being
destroyed by this government than I ever IMAGINED.To you douchebags who are saying that this film is manipulative, I assume
you're referring to the exclusion of some fantastic footage of W. making
brilliant, powerful and poignant speeches that make sense. I guess y'all are
right-but I guess Y'ALL are going to have to be the ones to scour the media
archives for SOME footage of that two-bit organ grinder's monkey saying
something intelligible. Good luck with that! DOUCHEBAGS!!!Michael Moore's powerful film is a brilliant portrayal of the epidemic of
self-imposed, self-protective IGNORANCE in America.

The Rupert Murdoch dominated Australian print media has been trying
desperately to write this film off as a pack of lies and distortions. After
seeing the preview session tonight I know what they're scared of - and
that's too many working class people knowing the truth that most wars are
run for political expediency and profit, and the working class are the most
likely cannon fodder. Fahrenheit 9/11 shows the true human impact of the War On Iraq by the
Coalition Of The Willing - and Australia is up to its ankle's in George W.
Bush's nether regions as part of that Coalition. We share the blame and
shame  - and can only hope our defacto-Republican government gets the boot,
along with Bush's administration.I appreciate that Michael Moore is revealing the failings of a grossly
malignant administration - and he's not just bagging the Republican Party.
He highlights the failure of Democrats to take timely or appropriate action
- especially when even one Democratic Senator with guts or integrity could
have made all the difference.The relief provided by appropriate music and necessary humour are what make
Fahrenheit 9/11 an entertaining, compelling and thoroughly effective
documentary which deserves every Award available.  10 out of
10.

What Americans need to know or consider - even if you don't agree. It
IS slightly one-sided, but there is nothing wrong with going and seeing
it. If you are for bush or against bush's war ideas, it is good for you
to see just to get a sense of what people can at least consider. If you
are for bush, all it will do is allow you to decide to be more firm in
that choice, but have a look at the other side. If you are for bush, it
re-enforces ideas and puts them into you head. If you have no opinion
on bush, it gives you a base to start research from and gets you
thinking about political activity. Once out of the theater, whatever
your view on the topic, go do research and find out what you can from
both sides - decide for yourself. DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS OF
THE FILM AS YOUR OWN IF YOU HAVE NOT SEE IT - SEE IT YOURSELF AND
CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF!

"Fahrenheit 9/11" is typical Michael Moore "documentary" - very flashy,
very cute, and in this case, blatantly hoping to get Bush out of office
(an admirable goal if there was one). **tons of spoilers, you've been warned**Moore does a lot which falls outside of the realm of a documentary, and
I don't like him abusing the category that way. The skits about reading
the patriot act to congress, and asking congressmen to send their kids
to Iraq have no place in a documentary. But he did come up with the
most amusing choices of background music I've ever heard (Shiny Happy
People, etc.), and I'm sure he's had people checking his facts very
carefully.The movie seemed confused whether its main point was 1) the connections
among the administration, oil, defense contractors, and Saudis (easily
a whole movie right there), or 2) the hijacking of the 2000 election
(where Moore failed to assign any blame to the ~50 Democratic Senators
who refused to support the House motion to contest the election
results), or 3) how foolish our government is to routinely pass a 600
page bill without anyone actually reading it (the patriot act, and most
everything else that goes through congress) or 4) the way in which poor
people are pushed into the military to fight the wars declared by rich
people. Yo, Director!! Can we have a little focus here!?!? The third
and fourth points have been going on since long before 2000, so they
diminish from pointing out Bush's ineptness, IMHO.

Finally THE TRUTH!!! Moore's done an excellent job of laying out the
behind the scenes incest the House of Bush has with the House of Saud.
The Neo cons have a habit of saying 2 unrelated things back to back as
if they're connected, and then repeating them ad nauseum until people
start to believe it, and this has never been more insidious. It's
refreshing to get information that doesn't "spin" ya in your seat. The
Neo-cons use the media to spread lies, and when caught in a lie just
deny you told the lie. Add to that a cup of self righteousness. It's
the constant lying and self-righteousness that's so disturbing. Moore
shows it as it is. The "Bonanza" clip was great! Bush's violation of
church & state has got to stop. Moore shows what war's all about. It's
all about killing. See the film. It's well worth it.

Amazing, truly tells us the real facts.The funniest part was when Moore visits the Rich-People big shots and
asked them why they are not sending their kids to war and why the kids
from the lower income neighbourhoods. Its nice to know that the
Canadians aren't the only one that think Prez Bush is a knob. What
Moore did in this movie is an eye opener for All Americans, forget
Americans, its an eye opener for the whole world. I wonder who were the
users that rated this exceptional movie a 1. What the viewer has to
realize is that this movie will take you out of your comfort-zone and
present the world and its workings in a realistic manner

This movie just goes to show that we aren't really free here. most of
us work like a dog everyday and don't get credit for it; but its OK to
follow and bow to some one that didn't really know what to do or what
he even did during out country's time of need. i love America, but not
when i cant even say what i really feel, and now they are banning
smoking all over Ohio. where in this country am i supposed to lay back
and relax without the fear of being watched. I'm not saying that i
don't appreciate a roof over my head and the food and education that i
have, i just don't see where spending that kind of money for this was
vital to us that are trying to survive to spite the war. thank you for

When I saw this movie I was amazed at the things that were shooting
right over our heads. It was interesting to see how corrupt our
government could be at times, but also really scary. Even if you don't
agree with the film and are an avid Bush supporter I still think it's a
good movie to see because looking at something from another point of
view is always refreshing. Even if you are a republican it doesn't mean
you need to follow your representative blindly. Get the DVD because it
has some great extra footage that wasn't in the movie, including scenes
from Iraq the day before the bombings and what all the Iraqi's thought
about the U.S. invading. Great movie and I wish that the news covered
more of the stories that Michael Moore has covered.

In the UK we usually get a government 'watered down' version of what is
happening with 'Big Brother USA' so refreshing to see Iraq-as it was.Michael Moore should be awarded an honorary knighthood for this
fantastic work (Fat Chance !) Not been a Moore fan in the past, but will now seek out anything he has
been involved with.A MAN OF INTEGRITY...........MR MOORE, I SALUTE YOU.A strange irony, is that, I am now videotaping a conspiracy theory
program-along the same lines, which I would probably have overlooked
before seeing this movie.I, being a UK citizen cannot vote in the US, but if Michael Moore were
to run for election-I would certainly vote for a man of such
honesty............what a pity more Americans do not !apologies if this sounds political-that was not intended, it is
however, most certainly intentional that this this should be a
recognition of honesty.

Moore's film sheds some light on how the USA now represents the perfect

dreadful nation that the USA has become (the descent accelerating
dramatically over the last decade), the article at the following link

"Don't talk to Michael Moore" memos to employees. Where's the "Pfizer

There has been a lot of controversy over this movie. From what I can gather
there is no middle ground. Either you think it is wrong, and thereby
criticize the content or you agree with it, and it further cements your own
ideas. This is a documentary and by definition means that this movie will be
biased for filmmaker (usually one sided). It is the filmmaker's point of
view. Whether you agree or disagree with Michael Moore, this documentary is
a success in that it makes one think about the possibilities. As stated in
the movie, people tend make firm decisions based on very limited
information. One can never know the full picture, I think we must entertain
the possibilities (and possible alternatives). This is a good documentary
that brings up some very good points. I think everyone should go and see it,
even if you don't agree with the conclusions. You may come away with
something. Moore definitely elaborates on the fear theme that he brought up
in Bowling for Columbine. It is hard to get into specifics without revealing
too many elements of the movie or not to get political. I will simply say
that I like Bowling for Columbine better.

This movie did a great job of getting the truth out there. I have known
the truth for a year or more now. My friend who is a few years older
than me has educated me on a lot of things, the truth about how corrupt
the American government is. Hell people think Michael Moore is crazy?
Think what you want but we need a man like this in society and it's
still not enough... The American government is getting out of control,
and those people who support Bush how can you back him up for going
into a country that never attacked America?? i just don't get it people
think the mans crazy and he's money driven?? How the hell can you say
that the man isn't some Hollywood asshole he has been writing books and
trying to inform you on how the government dicks you over everyday. If
you don't at least have an open mind on this issue you will become a

I saw it tonight. Opening is much like "For All Mankind", where the
author questions the circumstances of the 2000 elections by pointing
out just how many bush family members and employees were in key
positions to influence the florida elections.excellent cinematographic bookends begin and end the movie. never seen
a documentary made this well.The movie has a very powerful set of facts to present, and the facts
speak for themselves. There were so many important ones I wish he had
diagrammed the relationships between bush, bush family, and financial
interests in iraq, saudi arabia, and the bin laden family business ties
to the bush family businesses.A slant is present, but not overpowering, nor is it extreme. You could
feel the audience squirming visibly about 10 times starting about 50
minutes into the movie.the movie does not move to iraq subject matter until 1:20 has elapsed -
contrary to what i had believed, only the last 1/3rd of the movie is
about iraq.This is a watershed event. I would have given it a 10/10 but in a few
places the slant was gratuitously obvious and not needed to state the
important case.People who criticize the movie without seeing it are McCarthyists - as
dangerous as stalin or hitler to freedom and democracy as we know it.

I've seen the movie and i have to say that i agree with every thing it
was said in it. On the contrary to others i don't think that this is
just fiction, i think that this is the whole truth and those who says
otherwise are simply hypocrites and idiots for not excepting it. I
think this is an excellent movie to make people conscious of what is
really going on behind their backs. In my opinion Michael Moore did a
great job in it. It has the ability to make you think. This is a Master
Piece and i think that all the awards that were won, with this film
agree with that. If anyone haven't seen it yet i suggest you to see it.
It's amazing!!!

This is one of those cases in which the content of the film (what it is
about) goes beyond aspects such as quality and stuff... I mean, Moore
has made a great editing work, his style is as dynamic and entertaining
as usual; but even if it was a complete disaster in the technical
aspects what we're told in "Fahrenheit" is so outrageous that we would
get shocked as well. I know IMDb is not a site to discuss about politics, and we could fill
hundreds of lines talking about this movie, so I'll just comment a
couple of things about it: Some accuse Michael Moore of manipulate
people's opinion, of being a partisan. That's true, and I would add
that he's quite a demagogue. But hey, even if only a 50% of the stuff
that "Fahrenheit 9-11" shows were true, it would be one of the bigger
scandals ever in the history of Democracy. Nixon resigned for spying
the Democrats, Clinton almost had to leave the White House because of
some sexual affair... but, what about Bush Jr.? Jesus, he's up to his
ears in mud and what does he gets?? He gets re-elected. What's wrong
with this world?? Are we completely crazy??*My rate: 8/10

...BUT, after seeing Fahrenheit 9/11, I knew that this is the kind of
propaganda that's on the side of good, or at least reason.  While a good
deal of the footage in the film has already been on television, some of it
(like the ironic footage of Al Gore telling congressmen that they couldn't
make cause for debate due to no senators signing for the right to debate the
election decision of 2000, and of course the casualties of the war in Iraq)
has not been seen by too many Americans.  What I find in Fahrenheit 9/11 - a
funny, disturbing, and involving op-ed film piece from Moore - is that it
turns out to achieve a superb level of craftsmanship.  I haven't been
affected by a film that dealt with such a level of hot (yet appropriate),
questionable debate since Stone's JFK.  I feel the same reaction coming from
the audience, both as I was walking out of the theater and on this site on
the message board - they love it or hate it.  But what I find so
fascinating, when looking at both films, is that you could (or rather can
might be a more plausible word) find a few errors in some of the facts, yet
there is so much information, so many details about what could be counted as
truth or what could be counted as outright bullsh*t that you can't say it's
entirely one or the other.  And unlike JFK, 'Fahrenheit' uses its dramatic
edge without hiring a cast of Hollywood types.The film begins a little like how Moore's book began, Stupid White Men (only
that was far more detailed and less in sarcasm): "Was it all a dream?" Moore
asks, as the first image is of the camera panning down on a crowd
celebrating Gore's victory in Florida.  No less than a few minutes later,
Moore cuts to Bush on the inaugural day of becoming president, with rain
coming down, and hundreds of protesters railing against the cars.  Then the
story begins to unfold- Bush, after sitting dumbfounded, eyes wandering in a
classroom for seven or so minutes after the 9/11 attacks, goes to work to
sign the patriot act (which was practically un-read by congress, yet takes
away freedoms as random from Americans), puts 11,000 troops ("there are more
cops in Manhattan", comments an interviewee) in Afghanistan, and slowly but
surely unfolds and executes the invasion of Iraq.  While Moore concentrates
the first part of the film on Bush 1 and Bush 2's ties to the Saudi Arabian
government (as well, in due, to the Bid-Laden family and their business
investments), the second part goes more towards the soldiers in Iraq. Like Roger and Me and Bowling for Columbine, the idea(s) that drive what
Moore's putting together are commendable, which the topics are
controversial, thought provoking, and depressing.  It's not a pretty picture
he's painting in the slightest, and when he brings his hometown of Flint,
Michigan into the mix (this time revealing how Marine recruiters work, young
people who have family in the army and in the war, and one mother who loves
her country and has kids in the army and overseas), political allegiances
aside, one understands what small, low-income cities and towns go through in
times like these.  One could argue 'Fahrenheit' isn't a documentary in the
traditional sense.  However, as a document of what a country goes through,
in terms of the effect of 9/11, and what the war has done to the people
fighting in Iraq and the people at home, it's powerful even when it could
come to some as on a slant.And what I loved the most is that, throughout the film, the images and
editing styles kept me with eyes glued, and overall the effect of the film
can be quite entertaining.  There are moments when Moore inserts something
that's laugh-out-loud, even as it's not technically meant to be so, and then
even more so when it is.  On top of that, the music selections are perfectly
manipulative, sad, and playful.  Like with 'Columbine', the film doesn't
come without it's share of memorable moments, such as when John Ashcroft
sings "When Eagles Soar", or the montage of countries that decided to come
to our aid in the Iraq conflict, or when he flashes to the Oregon coast and
finds it is a 180 when compared to the fear and pumped-up 'security' by the
police forces and FBI.  By the end of the film, I knew it is geared for a
purpose.  But it's not the kind of purpose that some would have you believe,
like it's a 21st century answer to Triumph of the Will or something
ridiculous like that.  It is what it is; a filmmaker's own take on the
current state of affairs via the president of the free world.  Take it or
leave it.  A+

I watched this documentary along with its counterpart (which not many
people know about), "Fahrenhype 911". Watching these documentaries was
part of an English class I took on argumentative writing back before
the Bush/Kerry election. After watching both films and getting a
balanced view of the issues being addressed in "Fahrenheit 911" I
realized that Michael Moore's doc was nothing more than cut and paste
lies. its counterpart exposes the many flaws and lies of this
pseudo-documentary. If you want to know the truth watch "FAHRENHYPE
911"-it will open your eyes!! After watching this Michael Moore film I
really can't trust the guy to present anything without having major
doubts about his integrity and chalk his efforts up to mere propaganda!
Recently, he did a documentary about how bad healthcare is in the U.
S.. He claims that that we should follow Cuba and their example of
"good healthcare". I personally know someone who was just in Cuba with
permission fro the State Department, and he gave me the skinny about
Cuban healthcare. Basically, the doctors that are finished schooling
leave Cuba-otherwise they make the same money as most other occupations
in Cuba-no matter if they are teachers, waste disposal workers,
whoever-they all make pitiful wages. Who's left to perform healthcare
procedures-medical students!!!! How is this better than our healthcare!
If it see the name Micheal Moore as Director on a film-don't even
bother!

I am from Singapore and I love the film. There's a lot to be learnt
from this film and sometimes we're just too blinded. Time to open our
eyes and mind.No matter what your political preferences are, i think we all have to
agree that war is often the last option. I especially liked the part when he sat in the elementary classroom and
read the book with the children while America was under attack. i
wonder what was going through his mind too. When he said "I couldn't possibly imagine how it'll be like to lose a
child, a family member or a wife for that matter. I can feel the pain
(i think it was something like that)" i thought that was a little..
condescending.

This was an awfully interesting documentary.  What's funny about this film
is that no matter what you say about it, you're going to make a political
remark by saying it.  I'll just go ahead and say it.  I liked this movie.  I
wasn't much in favor of Bush in the first place; I was shocked to see some
of the atrocities that have been going on in our government.  I'm not much
of a documentary person, and this is the first time that I saw a documentary
in the theatre.  I kind of got bored during the second hour.  I thought a
few of the points made seemed to be a bit irrelevant/stretched.  For
example, the profane song that the soldiers hear before killing doesn't have
much to do with Bush.  It sounds and it is very inhumane, but to do such an
inhumane act of killing, one needs to listen to that kind of music.  Second,
Moore made it seem that Flint is in its terrible state because of Bush, when
it is actually moreso because of General Motors or somebody giving jobs to
Mexico/Canada, as Moore showed to us in Roger & I.  Anyways, I am very glad
that Moore clarified how Iraq has absolutely nothing to do with 9/11 and
Osama Bin Laden.  It was very interesting to see the Bush's past
associations with the Saudis and Taliban, rigging of the election, Axis of
the Willing, and fooling the public.  I'm sure I've offended millions of
people by now, but please do not take offense.  I love America, and this
great country needs a great leader whom the people can better trust and rely
on to take more informed decisions during his presidency. 
VOTE!!!

After seeing this movie back when it was first released, I remember
thinking that he had gone a bit overboard on the dramatics. Maybe a bit
too far in his accusations. Thinking about it now, I believe Moore was
completely on the right track. G.W.Bush has proved himself to be an
incompetent, untrustworthy and imbecilic buffoon time and time again.
His supporters dwindle, only leaving the raving lunatic supporters to
wave their giant oppressive flags. Good job Moore, much more
questioning should be done about those in power. The people in the US
seem to waking up more and more as they seek for truth. What is the
current president doing to your country? What will his legacy be?

Honestly we, Russians, don't like president Bush and his policy. So
this is the reason why we often enjoy any situation when Bush looks
like stupid donkey. But I can't praise this movie. It is not really
documentary film. President Bush is The Satan, he eats corpses of
unborn babies and also he made Lee Harvey Oswald to kill president
Cennedy. Bullshit! This man, the director of movie, is very cynical and mean scoundrel.
His main target was to defile president Bush. He don't want to find the
Truth about Bush. He is a fake man. I don't believe he has any feelings
about mothers who lost their sons in Iraq. It is just his personal
vendetta, not objective documentary film.I think president Bush is far from best American presidents. But
Michael Moore is a real disgusting bastard.

I think that it's a great movie. I love the way Michael Moore gets his
opinion through to the audience. Some of the methods might be a bit
harsh like providing us with a close-up at the dead bodies, both
soldiers and Iraqis. Other than that, I indeed enjoyed the humoring
touch that he gives this film. I especially enjoyed the one with the
president in a cowboy-movie with Donald Rumsfeld and Tony Blair at his
side (almost like the real world), and also those scenes where he's on
vacation, playing golf. These scenes amuse me. There are both strong and unimportant scenes, like there is in any
movie, but one of the strongest and most overwhelming is definitely
where the mother of a dead soldier tells her, and her sons, story. It
made me cry the first time I saw it, because it is so sad. Especially
when she's reading his last letter and when she stands in front of the
white house. This is any parents' nightmare. These scenes touched me
very intensely. It is very clear that Mr. Moore is trying to manipulate us, he even
succeeds with many. But I admire his courage to stand up and face the
president even though Bush tells Moore to 'go and get a real job'. He
is a man with a point of view and a story to tell, and I think his
thoughts are brilliantly shown in this film. I love manipulation, and
especially when it's shown with a humoring approach. The way he
manipulates with different kind of clips, music and quotes from the
president has been put together so clearly to manipulate us, provides
this film with one single big question. Is this the truth?Indeed it will make a difference. Why else would it be so
controversial? Why else would it be discussed all over the world? There
are so many opinions about this movie and what it contains, that it
would be strange if it didn't make a difference.

I wasn't going to right a comment on this film! But after reading the
comments written by predominantly Americans but by one Bitish women i
had to write something! OK its a propaganda documentary Micheal Moore
is biased, he cleverly manipulates images and interview BUT that
doesn't mean its not true! It takes shock tactics to wake up an
ignorant blinded by bulls**t nation.The whole rest of the world knows this stuff is true, how can the
Americans not! You can bury your heads in the sand and say its all lies
"by the liberals" (I'm not a liberal I'm from a forces family in
England), but i can assure any American that they are one of the most
corrupt, hated countries in the world, they have the most misinformed
population and are the leading funders of terrorism! They are the
biggest cause of political unrest in the west! The whole reason the UN
(who did not sanction the war - contrary to what some Americans have
written) thought that Iraq MAY have weapons of mass destruction is
because thats what they were told by US intelligence officials, ON THE
BASIS THAT THE US HAD SUPPLIED IRAQ WITH MASS CHEMICAL WEAPONRY IN THE
FIRST PLACE!! Which they used to massacre over 1 million Iranians.The fact is that this documentary showed things that people don't want
to acknowledge. The war was used to divert attention from the political
corruption in America. Look at what happened in New Orleans the country
has hidden its poverty and its own people that it blatantly couldn't
care less about! Its all good throwing your weight around the would
whilst your the biggest power but in the next 10 years that will be
Europe and China. Americas going to get a big wake up call if it thinks
it can get away with doing what it likes and invading any country it
pleases!

The problem is that there is little that those who are paying attention
won't know. There are, of course, some little things, and some horrible
shots of injured and dead Iraqis, but I don't think many will get angrier
for seeing F9/11. Worse yet, I think it would bore an audience of
fence-sitters, because there's nothing much that conclusive and, really,
there's not much that's enormously damning. There are things that even I
could think of that he could have brought to the attention of those who
don't know, like the staged toppling of Saddam's statue in Baghdad and what
it implies that the American media went along with the staging, or how about
the Jessica Lynch incident? I guess it's that Bush probably didn't have any
personal dealings with these events, but Moore should want to demonize the
entire administration, which he only does to an extent (Bush's cronies seem
only that). I appreciate what Moore is trying to do, of course, but, as a
film, this is his weakest ever. It barely has an arc, and, when it was
ending, I couldn't even tell. I'd much rather watch even The Big One. By the
way, the funniest thing about this movie is the imdb ratings page. You've
got to check that out! I did laugh at the film once in a while. The rest of
the audience was laughing and gasping appropriately, loudly so that you
could hear them. But the most telling moment was when Bush said something
along the line of "We were caught unawares" and a good amount of the
audience, probably something like 3/4, laughed hysterically. A couple of
people even repeated the word "unawares" with a sharp laugh afterwards. On
the other hand, at the end of the film, someone shouted very loudly that
Moore wanted to inspire an assassination of the President, so it just goes
to prove that almost everyone is stupid. Except me! 7/10.

I am a fan of Michael Moore and I read his impressive book "Dude, Where
is My Country" some time ago. "Fahrenheit 11/9" begins with an
adaptation of this polemic book to the screen, complementing with a
great research of image and sound, what was brilliantly written about
the the events after the September, 11th. In the last part of the
documentary, Michael presents the effects of the invasion of the Iraq
in the breast of some American families, who lost sons or relatives in
Iraq, and the testimony of some mutilated soldiers. I believe he should
have spent much more time showing the drama of the Iraquian families,
who lost their relatives and properties, the destruction of the
Iraquian cities, museums and archaeological fields, to show how insane
bombing is. The title of this documentary makes an analogy with Ray
Bradbury's novel, adapted to the cinema by François Truffault in 1966,
when in an oppressive future society, books are destroyed by fire.
Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper burns, while Fahrenheit
9/11 would be the "temperature" where freedom burns. The documentary
ends with a great citation to George Wells' 1984 and the magnificent
song "Freedom" of Neil Young, from the album of same name. In the
future, I believe this movie and "Dude, Where is My Country" will be
part of the scholarship curriculum for the next generations. Just in
time, from Yahoo! News, "last Saturday at Hollywood's Ivar Theater,
President George W. Bush was named worst actor of 2004 in Michael
Moore's documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" at the Razzies, an irreverent
spoof of the Oscars. US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and pop
singer Britney Spears were named worst supporting actor and actress for
"Fahrenheit 9/11". In a passage from the documentary, Spears can be
seen vigorously chewing gum and saying "I think we should just trust"
the president". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Fahrenheit 11 de Setembro" ("Fahrenheit September
11th")

When he won the Oscar for Bowling for Columbine, he got booed for
saying his opinions of America, I wish I knew why. Anyway, Michael
Moore returned in 2004 with another political documentary about three
pretty big issues. Basically it was all about the Two Towers
(obviously), the US military and political people and of course, the
idiotic George W. Bush being president. Moore gave good reasons for
Bush being an idiot, the shocking truths of the Two Towers destruction
day (September 11th 2001), and the effect that the military and
political people have on America (and the world). Personally, a
documentary about guns and the effect they have on the world (Bowling
for Columbine) is a lot more interesting than this quite depressing
film. It won the Cannes Film Festival FIPRESCI Prize Competition and
Golden Palm, both for Moore. It was number 8 on The 50 Greatest
Documentaries. Very good!
