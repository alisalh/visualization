I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully
framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through
looks and innuendo.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be nervous yet excited while
falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of
themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and
waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the
leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured
husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with
him and even understood where he was coming from.I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way.
Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even
felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really
beautiful.The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while
I reflected on it. That's how I judge a movie. If you are the type that
loves character driven films, I'd very much recommend it. If you don't
handle slow burn movies well, it might not be for you.

**WARNING: Contains plot spoilers**I don't normally write reviews but this is a case where the critics
seem to be totally disconnected from what they are supposed to be
reviewing. It is weird to see so little dissent in the press about this
film. Carol has many good points but more bad points.The good points are the amazing production design and costumes, and the
interesting 16mm cinematography (which does get quite grainy at times).
The technical side of things is fine, it looks very beautiful and
old-fashioned.The main problem is that there just isn't any emotional connection
established between the two main characters, or between anyone really.
The film doesn't make you care about people or their fates, and doesn't
explain why they would care about each other.The very first meeting between Carol and Therese highlights this. Carol
tries to seduce Therese because... well, she just does, from the very
first moment she lays eyes on her in the department store. We don't
know why, Carol has never met her before so presumably it's just
because Therese is young and pretty. We don't even see Carol reacting
to Therese's beauty, Carol just has this predatory gaze from the very
first frame, as if she was determined to find someone, anyone. How much
sympathy would we feel for a middle-aged married man doing these things
instead of Carol?Because of the way the story unfolds, it is also very hard to shake the
feeling that Carol is a rich person who is, in the end, able to get
whatever she wants.There ought to be sympathy for Carol being stuck in a dead marriage,
but she is getting divorced and already having an affair.There ought to be sympathy for Carol losing custody of her daughter
Rindy, but we never really see the mother-daughter relationship enough
to understand what this means to her. For example, in the first scene
Carol buys her daughter a train set instead of a doll in order to
impress the young shop assistant that she lusts after. We later see
Carol playing with the train set by herself while thinking of her own
problems, we never see the daughter using it. The daughter seems to be
little more than a plot device or a prop.There ought to be sympathy for gay lovers being parted by a bigoted
1950s society, but we never really see them as lovers. We see them make
love, but there isn't really a scene where they display any kind of
chemistry or deep affection. They come together because... well, they
just do. To make matters worse, they split up almost as soon as they
have got together, so we don't really get the time to feel anything
significant has been lost.The saddest part is when Carol dumps Therese so she can go to fight for
her daughter's custody, but then when, thanks to her lawyer's
manoeuvrings, Carol has a realistic chance of getting joint custody of
her daughter, she waives her rights to it. Why? Because it means she
can avoid the hassle of a nasty court case. How deep can Carol's love
for Rindy or Therese really be if these are her priorities? And why
tell us that the custody of Rindy means so much, more than her love for
Therese, and then show her abandoning custody? Perhaps the novel
explains why this makes sense, but the film certainly doesn't.The two hour running time should have been long enough to get proper
emotional connections built up, but instead the director squanders it
on overextended scenes that should have been much shorter. It makes the
whole film drag on without any character development.At one point Carol's husband Hodge has a door slammed in his face, it
ends on a nice shot of his partially-covered features, but it then goes
on to show him walking away from the house, getting in a car and
driving off. Extending the scene didn't serve any purpose, we know he's
annoyed and isolated but he's been annoyed and isolated for the entire
film. Another example has Carol and Therese arriving in a hotel, they
enter the lobby, they enter the room, they admire the room and then...
it cuts to them leaving the hotel. What did we learn about them from
this? That they enjoy the decor of expensive hotels? Wouldn't, for
example, adding a scene earlier in the film showing Carol doing nothing
but playing with her daughter Rindy been a better way to build up the
emotional stakes?"Carol" seems to be the kind of film where the subject matter and the
reputation of the participants has totally replaced objective
assessment of the work itself.Gay rights are important, Blanchett is a great actor and Haynes is a
great director. "Carol" is not an important or great film though, it's
telling the story of an affair without telling us why the affair
happened or why we should care. Its reviews seem to be based on what
"Carol" should have been, rather than what it actually is.

Thanks to the New York Film Festival I got the chance to see this
perfectly crafted film early.Carol's nothing short of fantastic. It's story is one of the best
romances i've seen put on the big screen. What I love is how nobody
makes it a big fuzz about the two lovers being females. It's treated
with the same respect as any other romantic drama, and it's done better
than most of them. The film is on another level when the two leads Cate Blanchett and
Rooney Mara are on screen together. Both undoubtedly gave two of the
best performances of the year. It's pace is slow, but never boring. Giving us some intense
slow-building moments that leaves us smiling or shedding tears. Carol's great. Watch it.

I had been looking forward to this film for months, and upon finally
viewing it- it's a huge disappointment. Todd Haynes, who's finest
achievement is still Far From Heaven (2002), has a knack for creating
intimate atmospheres with radiant colors and backdrops. Like Far from
Heaven, he succeeds with the aesthetic values of the 1950s by giving us
refined art direction and beautiful costumes. Unlike Far from Heaven,
we are given wooden characters and a predictable script, with a score
by Carter Burwell that sounds exactly like Philip Glass's creation for
The Hours (2002).Rooney Mara works in a department store, and finds herself attracted to
Cate Blanchett, a well to do married woman who flirts with her while
shopping for Christmas presents. Later they have lunch, and in the only
truly well acted scene in the film, seem to connect almost
instantaneously. The dialogue here is cleverly limited- so we can
instead watch the suggestive gestures of both characters that indicate
sexual attraction- and tension. It's too bad this is the only scene I
felt was able to capture this. The rest of the movie unfolds like a
poorly written episode of the series Mad Men, as the women keep meeting
up secretly whilst the husband gets suspicious and even hires a
detective to follow them to a hotel so he can later gain custody of
Blanchett's child. This is because homosexuality is "naughty".Perhaps the reason I felt bored watching Carol was that the material is
old and tired. Sexual repression in the 50s? We've seen this so many
times. Brokeback Mountain (2005) also dealt with homosexuality with two
men- and with much sharper direction and a more interesting story. The
actors there were also more believable. Speaking of the acting, Cate
Blanchett is indeed the standout. She's not nearly as strong as I had
heard or hoped for, but she's none the less ravishing and breathtaking
to gaze upon. She's at the peek of her career now, with 2 Oscars under
her belt, and indeed Carol should easily earn her a deserved 7th
nomination. But besides a juicy scene towards the end, the character
isn't that intriguing. There's a lot to be desired, and that easily
could be the fault of the screenwriter (Phyllis Nagy), who adapted the
script. Yes I get it- it's supposed to be subtle, but this character
felt empty. Blanchett is a fine actress- we could have gotten some more
fire from her character.Rooney Mara is even more flat. She relies simply on her pretty face. I
kept thinking Natalie Portman would have exuded so much more energy
with the role, since both women have similar physical dynamics to their
facial structures. Mara just comes off weak. There's not an ounce of
integrity or feeling coming through with this performance. If that's
how she was supposed to play it, then the fault lies in the director.
How she won at Cannes is beyond me. She's not impressive at all. She's
pretty, but that doesn't constitute good acting.The rest of the cast is easily forgettable. Sarah Paulson has a
thankless role, and she's usually very good (watch her in 12 Years a
Slave). Mara's boyfriend is the worst acting I've seen all year; very
high school drama club. Everyone else is going through their lines in a
robotic tone.This could have been an exceptional film. And I'm in the minority who
didn't like it (it's currently one of the top reviewed films of 2015,
and destined to be crowned with nominations on Oscar morning). But it
left me feeling cold, and bored. I might just be sick of seeing movies
about the 1950s and how everyone couldn't "talk about things like being
gay, and sex, and racial relations" back then. The subject has been
hammered over my head too many times. But the trailer for this movie
was a love letter. Why couldn't the movie be the same? Mara and
Blanchett are supposed to be in love, and yet their first meeting
aside- I never really felt a true connection between them. There was
never enough juice in their chemistry for me to believe it.

It's an inevitability that Carol will face categorisation as an LGBT
film, but that's not the limits of how it should be considered. It's
simply a heartfelt and deeply human love story where the principle
couple confronts insurmountable odds. In Carol's case, these obstacles
are the prejudices of the time and culture they live in. The film
frames this discrimination in a tangible and legal way, as the titular
Carol is accused of a morally indecent lifestyle by her ex-husband in
order to win custody of their daughter. The film isn't interested in
being a courtroom drama though, instead focusing on the blossoming
relationship between Rooney Mara's Therese and Cate Blanchett's Carol. Todd Haynes is known for his heightened style that evokes the melodrama
of Douglas Sirk, for instance. His 2002 film Far From Heaven feels
plucked from the cinema of the 1950s. However, Carol is a film that
feels plucked from the New York streets of the 1950s as the aesthetic
here is surprisingly naturalistic. It doesn't quite breach a
documentary-esque style with Edward Lachman's understated and
pleasantly grainy cinematography, but it all comes organically and
authentically with the elegant fashion of production and costume design
and the atmosphere that its cold Christmas setting provides. It's a
very restrained film  as there are only two particularly intimate
scenes  but the film carries an air of sexual and romantic tension
throughout. As Carol, Cate Blanchett challenges her polar opposite and equally
excellent work with Haynes as a Bob Dylan incarnation in I'm Not There
here. By nature of the film's structure, the first half is in the
perspective of Therese and the second focuses on the perspective of
Carol. There's an interesting inaccessibility about Blanchett in the
first half that draws you into Therese's infatuation. Mara, one of the
most promising actresses of this decade since her small memorable part
in The Social Network, uses her own reserved detachness  something
she's been frequently criticised for  to her own advantage. To watch
someone like Therese open up after being so repressed is thoroughly
cathartic. However, Blanchett whips the film from under her feet in the second
half. She litters the first half of the film with nuanced hints and
clues to her past desires, also communicating so much with very little.
She's elusive, but Mara is a key source of intrigue at that point due
to the honesty in her performance and unexpected dry wit. Once Carol is
struggling to deal with her own internal conflicts, Blanchett is on
fire and burns the house down with her ultimate rebuttal of the
accusations against her. Kyle Chandler, her suffering husband soon to
be ex-husband, shows such painful anguish in his brief outbursts. It's
a measured performance that anchors the film and the stakes of the
relationships. Every performance of the ensemble  from extras to bit
parts  are delivering among their finest work. It's an all-rounder in terms of Oscar-contention, with Haynes perhaps
being a more likely bet for Best Director than the film is for Best
Picture. Blanchett has won too recently but if Weinstein works his
magic, Mara would be a strong contender in either leading or
supporting. Phyllis Nagy will certainly duel with Aaron Sorkin in Best
Adapted Screenplay, even if her work is more patient, while the
production and costume design ought to destroy competition. A sure bet
should be Carter Burwell for his beautiful score that sunk my chest
with its few powerful notes. It's an achingly tender film that will be
timeless, even if it doesn't resonate with everyone with such
specificity. Carol shouldn't just be a statement for our time and a
condemnation for past mistakes, it's a demonstration that love is a
part of the human condition regardless of sexuality. 8/10

I watched Carol at the New York Film Festival, days after watching
Freeheld. Since both movies talk about love relationship between two
women, I was afraid I was going to see the same thing. Gladly, I
couldn't be more wrong. Carol is such a beautiful movie, subtler than I
had expected.Even though I loved the movie, I'm aware that it's not for everybody.
It's not fast paced, as current films tend to be. It takes its time to
carefully construct the characters and to make us root for them. Credit
is due to the cast, as Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant,
and to the director Todd Haynes, who conducts well the story.Moreover, the film is visually stunning, with impeccable make-ups and
wardrobes, not to mention the beautiful locations covered in snow while
they take a road-trip. Finally, the soundtrack is equally wonderful,
with songs that correctly set the tone of their relationship.It probably won't be a box office hit, but I do hope everybody gets a
chance to see it eventually.Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-f6

Apparently, the novel this movie's based on came out more than half a
century ago and the movie version should've been released in about half
that time in order to be fresh, daring, original or topical. But,
today, it's just out of place.Sure, Carol, the movie that is, shows us a ton of 1950s women who like
to smoke and eat in restaurants. Repeatedly. It's a wonder none of them
coughed once or gained weight since that was the bulk of the film. In
between those smoking and eating scenes were dry spells of two
character drawn to each other for chance coincidence of two women
liking other women. As good of actresses as the leads are, I never
bought their chemistry or depth other than they both happened to be
lesbians.Basically  and that's what this is, basic  two women meet. One rich,
the other aimless. One getting divorced, the other clinging onto
affection. Suddenly there's a road trip to clear the title character's
mind after the thought she might lose custody of her child in the
divorce. Forced romance ensues andthe rest is spoilers, albeit
obvious.I didn't find the story compelling, or even interesting enough to care
about any of the characters. Rooney Mara's Therese, the lost one,
spends the grand majority of the film just staring off into nothingness
while, I suppose, we're supposed to see depth in her. (Hint: I didn't.)
Cate Blanchett's Carol, the richie one, seems to be in another movie,
in another room, just reading lines from the script.It would be easy just to call this movie boring and dismiss it. But, it
really is that. Barely anything happens and the stuff that does, I've
seen countless times before in both gay and straight forbidden love
films. Only, those movies had complexity, decent to great
cinematography and chemistry between the leadsso we could, you know,
root for the forbidden love.Hell, this one was so dry, I was only told the mother, Carol, is
heartbroken she can't see her child after the divorce. I never once
believed Carol couldn't live without her daughter. She was, again, just
reading her lines.Sadly, I don't have much positive to say about this. I wanted to like
Blanchett, as I almost always do, but I didn't. I wanted to marvel,
once again, at Mara, but she seemed as lost as her character. I did,
however, really like the ex-lover character of Abby, played by the
wonderful American Horror Story regular, Sarah Paulson. She would be my
only vote here for an award nomination. But, even then, I wouldn't be
voting for her underused part.I didn't hate this, or even really dislike it that much. I would've had
to care more to think that hard on it. It's just a movie I do regret
seeing and won't be visiting Carol again.

Others have already mentioned the film's beauty, elegance, attention to
period detail, acting etc. All amazing. As a gay man "of a certain age"
I felt deep gratitude for the gift given by the artists who created
this film. The direction is so subtle and effective, using the all the
tools of film making to communicate information, meaning, and emotion.Like Brokeback Mountain, this film turns cliché on its head and
transcends the particulars of the protagonists' lives by illuminating
more universal themes. It is a period/genre film that acts to balance
well established tropes of its genre, a powerful corrective to SO MANY
previous films that repeated the same old false, stereotypical, and
often tragic images of gay lives. Beyond merely telling some real
truth, Carol has so much to say about strength, resilience, and the
possibility of finding joy in difficult circumstances. As such, it was
deeply satisfying to this viewer.

Finally. FINALLY. This is the movie which completely overwhelmed my
expectations and blew me away.Romance is actually one of my favorite genres, but unfortunately it has
let me down a lot more than once. Not the case with Carol. This has a
strong possibility of being the best movie of 2015.Therese is a woman working in a store who has an interest in trains and
photography. But her hobbies is not enough to escape her boring and
quite uneventful life. Carol has a wonderful daughter and is doing fine
financially... but has an husband (whom she is trying to divorce) who
won't leave her alone and makes her feel miserable.These two people meet, and... they connect.First off, the story itself is already incredibly captivating. It takes
place during a time period where homosexuality was not only frowned
upon, but there were even laws against it. So seeing the two of them
facing struggles in order to keep in contact with each other is
fascinating to behold. And it is because the love story is so damn
beautiful. There is a lot of visual language. Eye contact and body
language often speaks for itself. And it's excellently executed, as you
sometimes know exactly how these two character are feeling without a
single word spoken. And even the dialogue itself has subtlety to it.
There are plenty of times where either Carol or Therese insinuate
feelings by using seemingly casual sentences. "Your perfume... it
smells good." is really just a synonym for "I want to kiss you". "Oh
stop it, you look perfect!" can very well mean "I want to spend the
rest of my life with you." The lines are not obvious giveaways and I
love it. The audience gets to think for themselves.But what really makes this movie work is the acting. It's absolutely amazing. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are at their best ever. They
make the characters so real, so human, that you wish they actually
existed. Kyle Chandler also throws in a remarkable performance as the
husband. You root for the two girls... but you don't hate Harge either.
There is one scene where he has gone so far as to get himself to the
house Carol and Therese is staying at for the weekend. And when he's
told he can't have her, I was really feeling bad for the guy!I can't remember the last time I have been as touched by a movie. It
hit my heart just in the right places, and when I walked out of the
theater I felt like I had just experienced someone else's life.Okay, the trailer revealed too goddamn much from the movie, so several
important plot details I already knew beforehand. But even that
couldn't stop the perfectly orchestrated ocean of emotions it bathed me
in. Carol will stick to your brain like glue after you've watched it.
Oh and the movie too ;)

In 1950s New York, a department-store clerk who dreams of a better life
falls for an older, married woman.Director Todd Haynes has created a film of subtle and undeniable
beauty. The set design is magnificent and builds a world that is
uniquely 1950s, the costume design contributes greatly to the overall
sense of time and place which can be hard to underscore in a period
piece but the crew of Carol has manage to pull it off effortlessly.
Todd Haynes direction is fluid and his camera lingers to capture the
full emotional content of each scene. The score by Carter Burwell adds
another layer of sincerity to this motion picture, and the
cinematography by Edward Lachman vividly illustrates the elegance of
the locations used.The performances are outstanding, the relationship between Rooney
Mara's "Therese Belivet" and Cate Blanchett's "Carol Aird" anchors the
film. Rooney Mara plays "Therese" with an underlying sense of innocence
that she herself knows more than anyone, she exclaims "I just say yes
to everything", Mara's physical embodiment of her character is
undeniable and everything you need to know about her motives can be
found in a glance or a stare. Blanchett is terrific as "Carol" and
there is a mysterious side to her character that begins to unveil as
the narrative progresses, her particular predicament is a major source
of pain in her life. Her relation with "Harge Aird" portrayed by Kyle
Chandler highlights this, as he becomes deeply dissatisfied with her
actions.It's the sequences were Mara and Blanchett share the screen that define
the brilliance of this film. There interactions are spellbinding from
there first unusual interaction at "Therese's" department store to
there affectionate conversations in "Carol's" car. To see how they
progress is fascinating and the way in which Haynes frames them apart
is superior direction. Its how we comprehend there relationship without
cliché dialog, but mostly through facial expression that we get a sense
of how they feel for each other.The structure of the narrative itself was quite unexpected and I felt a
major satisfaction as the film began to conclude. Its also perfectly
paced with the exact amount of lingering to allow emotions to run wild.
Its simplistic narrative tells a deeper more wholesome story about
human connection and how it is viewed by society in the 1950's which
strangely parallels today.Overall, I found Carol to be quite beautiful, from its spectacular
production and costume design, fluid direction, mesmerizing
performances and incredible pacing this is a film where I personally
relished on those lingering moments that detail the emotions of the
characters. I am going to give Carol a 9.2/10.

Unlike the sentimental melodrama "Brooklyn," Director Todd Haynes has
fashioned a more salacious tale based on Patricia Highsmith's 1952
novel "The Price of Salt" (later named "Carol"). Like his predecessor,
Douglas Sirk, the grandmaster of the 1950s melodrama, you can always
count on Haynes to deliver the goods in terms of brilliant
cinematography, bravura acting (this time provided by Cate Blanchett
and Rooney Mara) as well as a production design that magnificently
recreates the heady days of the early 1950s, just as Dwight D.
Eisenhower ascends the "throne" of the American presidency for the
first time. Despite all the positives, why then is "Carol" simply
"average" and mediocre to boot?When Highsmith's novel came out in 1952, a lesbian romance was
considered fairly scandalous. Indeed, when the film's protagonist,
Carol Aird, begins a lesbian affair with salesgirl Therese Belivet, the
villain of the piece, Carol's rather mean and pathetic husband, Harge,
invokes a "morality clause," permitting him to gain full custody of the
couple's young daughter, Rindy, without the possibility of Carol having
any visitation rights. Carol's ensuing decision to get away from it all and inviting Therese
on a sensual whirlwind of a cross country car trip may have been
shocking for 1950s readers, but today it feels like old hat. We're
supposed to get excited about the two lovers' intense desire for one
another but what's so original about a lesbian romance? It's simply not
enough on which to hang your hat on for an entire movie. True, at the
midpoint, there is a welcome plot twist involving Harge, who hires a
private investigator to tape record Carol and Therese as they make love
in the "presidential suite" of a cheap motel. But what happens after that? Spoilers AHEAD. Carol goes back to Harge
but eventually (wouldn't you know it?) is unable to shake her love and
lust for dear Therese, and it's postulated at the climax that indeed
they will once again reunite. The uncreative ending -- which really
needed some kind of extraordinary twist -- leaves the two lovers
staring at one another in a fancy hotel restaurant, as the screen fades
to black. I suppose the non-stop "passion" between the two principals
is what has seduced both critics and the average film-goer alike into
declaring that this is some kind of masterpiece. But in reality Mr.
Haynes should be applauded only for creating an impressive atmosphere
mere attraction (no matter how intense it is), is not enough for us to
care about characters that are in need of much more detailed
development.

I had the chance to see this movie during the Dutch film festival. I want to start by saying that this is a "must see". I am very critical
about my lady loving movies, and the way Cate and Rooney portray their
characters, and their on screen chemistry is absolutely breathtaking.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be falling in love. You'll
get taken away with how this all develops and affects their lives. It's an easy-going, subtle movie but never gets dull, it keeps you
hooked from beginning to end. Also the parts played by Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler are worth
mentioning. It's been a while, if ever, since such a loving movie was
released in this genre.

I'm at a loss with this movie. I went to the late showing last night,
which was a mistake because this drama about two lovers persecuted by
ignorance and misogyny will exploit any fatigue you have and try
desperately to put you to sleep. I struggle through nearly two hours of
this movie and eventually gave up and left figuring that not much else
would happen as nothing did happen throughout the entire first three
quarters. I went and read some spoiler discussion on it on a clickbait
website to find that I didn't miss much.Don't get me wrong, these actresses are at the top of their game with
strong performances by both lead Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. It's
the script that seems dull to me. The drama and romance appear so
distant and tension so boring that it was nearly impossible to get
close to these characters and care. Check out more of this review and

In 1950s America, Carol is nearing the end of a quietly unhappy
marriage to Harge, and trying to retain custody of their daughter
Rindy. There is a morality clause and Carol's lesbian tendencies bring
this to bear, especially when she falls for Therese, and a relationship
gradually begins to blossom.I was expecting great things from this film: Cate Blanchett as Carol
and Rooney Mara as Therese have both been getting glowing notices. And
those notices are richly deserved: both women are first rate. I wish I
could say the same for the film. There are two strong plot elements
here: the legal wrangle and the growing (and forbidden) relationship.
The film should have been electrifying. But it is slow and,
regrettably, boring. I know that you don't have to take a film at
breakneck speed but, given the drama inherent in the two major plot
threads, not only does not very much happen, it happens very slowly.I'm sure this will be up for bags of awards (I get the impression that
it regards itself as Important), but I was disappointed.

A perfect marriage of director and material, I can't think of anyone
else but Todd Haynes for this story of love and desire blossoming in a
desert of repression. Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the
post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about- gender
roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis
Nagy's screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the
psychological conflicts and complexities. In particular, the character
of Carol's conventional husband, Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) could
have, in lesser hands, received much shorter shrift than here. Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there's
no reason to give it anything less than full marks. I was completely
engrossed by it from start to finish.

I don't understand why this movies is so overrated, it is a boring love
story, the only difference from a usual boring love story is the
same-sex concept. The name of Todd Haynes made me expect a movie as emotionally intense
as Far From Heaven (2002). Now, I realise it was just wishful thinking.
I think Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) does not fall for Carol (Cate
Blanchett), she desires all the riches she possess and this leads her
to feel something unexplainable towards Carol, for me that seems
definitely not love. Whatever it is, it should have been described more
thoroughly. Only after a short period of time both characters are
presented to us, they start to love each other, and to prove they're in
love, they move slowly, and as if that was the real thing, toward the
moment when they share the same bed, have sex. That's OK with me but
where is passion, where is love, and why so quick we don't know
anything about the characters. To sum up, I was absolutely disappointed because in no way Carol met my
expectations. The story telling makes it difficult to understand what
is going on; when and how those people fell in love, the husband who is
he, why does he want Carol back even though he knows her preferences
and she does not love him, the lover of Therese he suddenly comes into
the scene then disappears, and lots of similar pointless stuff.
Costumes are great, though. And finally, please stop taking part in
projects you don't believe in with only the intention of getting an
award. Famous actresses making out does not make a great movie, it
needs more than that.

If you have watched your fair share of lesbian movies, you'll
understand the thirst for a lesbian love story that is well made and
Carol pretty much is that game changer we've all been waiting for. I won't give away too many spoilers because this movie is already quite
predictable. It's a love story set in the 1950's America where
homosexual romances were obviously forbidden so things can't get
anymore surprising than that. There are a couple little unexpected
moments here and there that formed the overall arc regarding Carol's
battle over the custody of her daughter but other than that, this movie
is quite slow-paced. Though, I would note that that is a good thing. It
is this slow revelation that makes several key scenes very rewarding.
One of which was the love scene. Having read the book, I was already
aware that it would be like that so it wasn't particularly a big deal
for me.One thing I have always believed about this story just out of reading
the book is that the storyline is quite simple. You have these two
women falling in love with each other only to have a certain obstacle
befall them but it is the complexity of their characters and what polar
opposites of one another they are that feels the most intricate.
Screenwriter,Phyllis Nagy did a great job honouring her late friend,
author, Patricia Highsmith's book and it was evidently captured on
screen with how much the movie felt like it was just as if though it
had been any ordinary heteronormative film we see today.Then there's Todd Haynes. I have never seen anything he has directed
before but I'm sure the hype is valid because the direction and overall
cinematography of this film was simply magnificent and a pleasure to
watch. I was completely enraptured by every scene. I know many people
have raved about how gorgeous this film was and I can't add anything
more to that because that is pretty much the only word that does it
justice. Carter Burwell's score although repetitive at times was evocatively
divine and meshed well with the era of the film. I would have loved if
the piano theme song that played in the trailer had been in the film at
some point.Cate Blanchett as per usual is marvellous in this role. She is THE
Carol that I have read in the book and she handles her character with
such dexterity, going from steely cold and intimidating to a hopeless
romantic/passionate lover and then to a desperate mother fighting for
her child with such grace and poise. Rooney Mara on the other hand is
rather spellbinding in this although I am sure I could imagine someone
else as Therese too if I wanted. It is probably the fault with the
character as it dwarfs opposite Carol. The supporting actors are worth
mentioning too as Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson never fail to impress
each time they are on screen albeit how little screen time they both
had. Which leads me to the ending and probably the most spoiler-ish part of
the review. The ending is really the reason why this movie is getting
plenty of Oscar buzz or so I think. It is the way that Todd was able to
translate onto the big screen that crucial moment in the culmination of
the story that left us, the audience speechless and wanting to know
more when it cuts to black. The way he makes it feel like we were
Therese looking at Carol and the way that he captured Carol looking
over at her in those final close-on shots of her. My heart raced in
that moment. It was only interpretive of one thing. A happy ending for
a lesbian story that we have all been holding out for and it was done
so perfectly."That's that."

I'll try to be brief, since the film wasn't.Visually, this was a satisfying film to watch. Like looking through an
old photo album from the 1950s, beautifully shot.Narratively, it was an utterly predictable story, without a single
twist, every plot point telegraphed and seen miles in advance.Rooney, reminiscent of a beautifully boyish young Demi Moore, was quite
good, though her character's relationship to the boyfriend Richard was
not particularly nuanced. A little more ambivalence on her character's
part toward the relationship would've created some needed tension.Blanchet was interesting, but in a one-dimensional kind of way. She was
beautiful, but her manner and delivery seemed superficial and
artificial. I'm a bit undecided as to whether these were traits with
which she was intentionally trying to imbue the character of Carol, or
whether this is how she plays all her characters.This is a mainstream drama, a vehicle for the stars to garner Oscar
nominations. A far cry from Haynes' far superior Far From Heaven,
however. Watchable, for sure, but for me only once.

Carol is a good film, with a very important subject, and the script
never addresses it head on, rather with class, elegance and subtly.It's a great love and life story about one woman fighting for her right
to be happy and another trying to figure out how can she really be
happy. Each of them is the answer to the other.The script could feature more insight, but then again, the film is
supposed to be subtle and let the images speak for themselves. The
cinematography is outstanding and the score is downright superb.
There's a feeling, a certain atmosphere that makes the film truly
peculiar and one of a kind.But in the end, i think that it all comes down to Cate Blanchett and
Rooney Mara, as they give unforgettable, brilliant performances. They
are always perfect of course, but here there's something one of a kind
about their performances. Its not only the characters that fall in love
with each other, but also you who fall in love with them. Its charming, important, powerful, resonant, and features two one of
kind performances.

Carol is complicated. Outwardly, it's a retro-drama about forbidden
love between two women in the 1950s. Underneath, it's looking at the
more complex and intriguing world of human connection. It's sexy yet
proper; it's delicate yet strong; it's romantic yet haunting; a
picturesquely shot period-piece that stuns with its beauty, both
visually and aurally (the score is mesmerizing). So with all the
technical perfection, why did I find it to be the most critically
overrated movie of 2015? Despite its unendingly admirable skill, it
left me unsatisfied and, worse yet, emotionally confused. Mara plays a
naïve young woman spellbound and emotionally seduced by Blanchett's
broken and mesmerizing Carol, a woman who seems to have a
"There's-Something-About-Carol"-esque effect on everyone she meets.
Both actresses are as phenomenal as you've probably heard, but our
relationship to them is nearly as frustrating as their relationship is
to each other. In a terribly confused bit of story framing, we meet
them at the end of their relationship before going back to the
beginning, as we watch the sheepishly sweet Mara get emotionally
destroyed by the almost predatory Blanchett. This would be fine, except
the movie itself doesn't seem to be wrongly convinced that Carol is
ultimately a "good" person, giving her too many chances to plead her
selfish case. Herein lies the complication: despite these flaws, it's a
visually gorgeous and thematically interesting film. Director Haynes
creates a hazy atmosphere in his perfect Christmas setting,
highlighting the similarities between its titular character and the
holiday season's preposterous promises. Unfortunately these noble
positives couldn't mask my overwhelming sense that Carol was
less-than-noble in its own messaging.

I'm really not a fan of Todd Haynes's drab, dull, ugly brand of period
'realism.' The cinematography in this film is horrible, and the
characters never leave this dimly lit, grey, polluted cityscape
throughout the film (their 'roadtrip' consists of only grey roadsides
and fugly motels, it's also not clear where exactly they were going or
why.) The relationship and overall storyline takes a long time to break
through the muck, and even then it remains subtle and flat, not
particularly memorable. As I watched the divorce proceedings, I
couldn't help but think how, if these were homosexual men who had been
filmed at the time, the threat would not be taking away the custody of
children, but jailtime. I read people comparing this film to "Brokeback
Mountain," but I don't think it should be.

The movie "Carol," a lesbian romantic drama that is based on the book
"The Price of Salt" by Patricia Highsmith, is getting named Best Film
of the Year by just about everyone, it seems, and making all the award
short-lists. And Helen is Highly disappointed. Let me add up front that
the film was costumed by Sandy Powell, art directed by Jesse Rosenthal,
and filmed by Edward Lachman, who will all likely (and deservingly)
receive awards for their work here. But I have issues with director
Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy. I saw "Carol" at the New York Film Festival, where just about every
film was more interesting than this gigantic slice of Boring. After
watching the film, I assumed most people would dislike it as much as I
did, so I was shocked when I did a quick Google search and saw the
Variety review pop up saying "High expectations don't quite prepare you
for the startling impact of Carol, exquisitely drawn, deeply felt" No
way! My first order of business is to change Variety's intro line:
"High expectations don't quite prepare you for": the slow emptiness of
this mundane, overly precious, pointlessly detailed movie.Listen, I adore Cate Blanchett as much as anyone. And no one can say
she is not gorgeous. At one point in the film  at a party, her
estranged husband concedes to her that she is the most beautiful woman
in the room. Well, that never changes. She is the most beautiful and
the best dressed and best groomed person in every scene. So, let's all
agree to put Cate Blanchett's face in the dictionary under the word
Perfection, and then we can all go home and save ourselves two hours of
lifeless artifice. And if Cate were selling lipstick, or stockings, or
fur coats, I would buy them all. But I would not recommend this movie
to anyone. I'm happy for Cate that she got such a glamorous star vehicle in which
to show off. But why is no one else stating the obvious  that this is
essentially a vanity project for Cate Blanchett? Unfortunately however,
in this movie, we cannot see Cate's rich inner life through her the
heavy cover of makeup and fur. Remember the episode on "Mad Men," where
Don Draper is trying desperately to find the ideal, alluring model to
put in his fur coat ad? Todd Haynes' Cate Blanchett should get that
job! She is precisely what Don was looking for  an impossibly
beautiful fantasy of aspirational glamor and exquisite opulence. Women
want to be her and men want to have her exactly because she is so
flawless and empty; you feel nothing for her as a character  no
complicated emotions to ruin the high-gloss illusion. And honestly,
Cate, you are better than this; you don't need to advertise your
quintessential (surface) beauty. That Don Draper gig, and this movie,
are beneath you; you can act. This brings me to the lesbian theme of the story. Helen Highly objects
to the portrayal of Carol and her younger lover (played by Rooney Mara)
as a Hollywood male fantasy of woman-on-woman sexuality. Due to Haynes'
decision to maintain the look-and-feel of a 1950s flick, the movie
refrains from overtly explicit sex scenes, but still it has the tone of
cheesy pin-up porn  made for men, and not about real-life women who
have ambiguous thoughts and difficult feelings. Highsmith's 1953 book,
"The Price of Salt," became a lesbian-romance cult-novel, due largely
to its being the first authentic expression of lesbian love that did
not have the punishing ending that was prescribed by 1950s morality.
Highsmith was a lesbian herself (a fact she denied throughout most of
her career), and this story is semi-autobiographical, telling the tale
of when she was a shop girl who fell into a romantic obsession over an
older married woman who was a customer at the store. But let's stop
there for a moment. (Well, there's not much else to tell; the movie
mostly repeats variations of the first scene.)So many people are eager to say how this film is "important for women"
 as if it were still the act of sexual bravery and social revelation
it was in the 1950s. And that is simply not the case. Today, the
storyline is outdated. The book was ground-breaking and radical; the
movie is conventional and banal. And this is the fault of the
screenplay, which does not capture the emotional intensity or poetic
eroticism of the book. The book meticulously detailed the interior lives of these two,
passionate yet confused women; the film, instead, meticulously and
ploddingly details a story that was only loosely referenced in the book
(because Highsmith was interested in tortuous desire and fearful
loneliness, not a who-gets-the-kid divorce case). In the movie that
Nagy and Haynes made, the tale becomes a simplistic, self-righteous,
politically-correct after-school-movie. Haynes attempts, it seems, to
depict the women's emotions with an endless series of long, still- life
gazes. And so it seems that Haynes cares more about his visual style
than he does the psychology of his characters. And to those who like to
say that "Carol" is comparable to "Strangers on a Train," I say: Yes,
Hitchcock and Highsmith shared an affection for frosty blonds (perhaps
Todd Haynes does as well). But Haynes is no Hitchcock. (And "Carol" is
no thriller.) Hitchcock knew how to make an ice-queen come alive on the
screen, BUT he also understood plot; he knew what was a compelling
story and what was not. "Carol" is not. So, Cate Blanchett and Todd
Haynes can wish she were Grace Kelly or Kim Novak all day long, but
she's not going to touch a hair of their blond locks with this script
and this director.

Very sad to see Blanchett sink to the level of political propaganda.
The old feminist hogwash that depicts marriage as a patriarchal
disaster simply finds another twist in the context of homosexuals, and
of course the straight husband becomes the antagonist, and the real
source of the problem, rather than sexual perversion and marital
infidelity. The constant hammering away by Hollywood against families
seems obsessive and mean-spirited. When children are growing up in
single parent homes, and test scores are the lowest they have ever been
throughout the history of the United States, you would think that
people would want to see the family restored, so that children could
grow up healthy and whole, but Hollywood appears to thrive on
negativity. I'm reminded of Dylan's song, Idiot Wind: "What's bad is
good, what's good is bad, you'll find out when you're on the top;
You're on the bottom...."

I dunno if the people reviewing this even saw the same film, or if
they're just studio execs boosting their own movies reviews for the
sake of winning the upcoming awards, but this movie is garbage. Far
from being academy award winning imo.Cinematography: The director repeats the same shots of someone making
overdramatic facial expressions through frosted glass through the
entire film. It loses its effect after the 10th time, and by the end of
the film its just plain annoying. As far as crafting a 50sesque feel,
they succeeded. This film even looks like it was made in the 50s.
Unlike the ever famous Madmen though, this is not a good thingStorytelling: As I said in the summary line, this story moves slower
than a snail caught in tar. From the getgo, it becomes obvious there is
a lesbian affair going on here, but for the next hour plus, the plot
never develops into anything more than this. In fact, we never even see
any actual physical romance between the 2 leads.Acting: I felt it got over the top a few times. Kate Blanchett is the
type of actress that forgets shes not on the Broadway theater when shes
doing cinema, and it can be really ridiculous at times. This is one of
those times. TL;dr version: this movie is a complete waste of time and the plot
summary sums up the entire film to the point where you literally don't
even need to watch it

I saw the movie Carol and am extremely disappointed. Cate Blanchett as
Carol was stylish. Screenplay is very weak. There is very little
conversation between Carol and Therese (Rooney Mara). The movie is too
long. The scenes are dragged. There is no substance in the movie. Cate
Blanchett was great in movies Notes on a scandal and of course Blue
Jasmine. In this movie , her style is obvious in her clothes, in her
voice , in her gait but there are no dialog or conversation. The movie
is poorly edited . I did not enjoy the movie. Rooney Mara was good .
Rooney Mara's role was better than Cates Blanchett role. But on the
whole, not even nomination worthy. Really boring movie. Weak.

A well-made, workmanlike disappointment, much inferior to Haynes's Far
From Heaven. You knew where it was going and it went there. Along the
way there are no surprises from the two lead characters. The most
surprising thing, which lifts it above Lifetime territory, is that it
does not villainize the male characters. They have the values of their
time, to be sure, but the husband and the boyfriend mean well, while
the detective and Carol's lawyer are both matter of factly
professional. Her lawyer, in particular, does an excellent,
nonjudgmental job with what looks like a hopeless case.The most erotic scene in the movie is not the consummation but rather
the first lunch date, where Carol looks ready to swallow Therese alive
and Therese seems ready to jump right down her throat. The imbalance of
power in that scene is distasteful. As I grow older, I find that love
stories of any gender between an older sophisticate and a young naif
have either a predatory or a transactional vibe to them that puts me
off. Throughout, Carol knows exactly what she wants and is cool and
composed enough to wait for Therese to figure herself out, catch up and
provide it. At its least exploitative, this kind of relationship is a
bargain, where the elder provides education in return for rejuvenation.
And since this is a Patricia Highsmith story, material concerns are
part of the bargain. Carol's standard of living makes a powerful
impression on Therese from the outset, and she quickly grows used to
what it can provide By the end, Therese understands perfectly well who
she is, and some other women can perceive it. But the ending, when
Therese moves from a Greenwich Village party of impecunious young
bohemians to join Carol for dinner at the Oak Room, is set up in such a
way that we don't know whether Therese is opting for true love or for
the bigger and better deal. I'm not sure Therese knows either. For what is supposed to be a story of amour fou, it isn't fou enough.
The basic setup is Anna Karenina, but Harge isn't Karenin and nobody
throws themselves under a locomotive. The ending is not quite a happy
ending, more like happy enough given the circumstances. That may be
real life, especially in the social circles of Carol and her husband,
but, unlike Far From Heaven, there's no pathos here and no tragedy. I
give it a B.

I can see why a story like this might have been edgier and more
important when it first appeared in the early 1950s. But things have
changed a lot since then. The affair between the two women would not be
a big deal today, which means the message that a movie about it carries
today is, "Look how backwards and repressive things were in the 1950s"
(or in some such stories, the early '60s). That's become a hackneyed
theme, one that we've seen it in any number of other movies -- "Dead
Poets Society" and "Brokeback Mountain," to name just two off the top
of my head.Still, what we have here would be an interesting period piece -- the
look certainly seems convincingly '50s -- except that it's so slow at
times that it's like flipping through an album of still pictures. This
seems to me a common failing of movies based on celebrated "literary"
novels: not enough actually happens. The elements that give the novel
its reputation are likely its elegant writing, its compelling narrative
voice and the interior lives of its characters, and those are precisely
the things you can't really put on film. So the filmmakers work around
this by substituting long pauses, "meaningful" gazes, lingering shots,
and painterly compositions (this film's have been compared to Edward
Hopper's). I sometimes felt as if the many silent beats between lines
of dialogue in this movie were filled up in the filmmakers' heads with
the book's prose, which maybe they should have scrolled across the
screen or something so the rest of us could experience it too.Then there's the Lifetime-movie-esque plot about the main character
Carol's custody dispute. Those events point up how unfair it was when
gay relationships were closeted, but again, that's not a groundbreaking
insight anymore. Nothing else is interesting about them, and the
filmmakers themselves seem so little invested in that part of the story
that when she's asked toward the end whether she's been allowed to
visit her daughter, Carol gives this unbelievable answer: "Once or
twice." Once or twice? This was so important to you, this was the thing
you were fighting for, and yet you shrug it off now with "once or
twice," like you can't even be bothered to remember? In Patricia
Highsmith's novel, her answer is: "Yes, last Sunday for an hour or so."
That's what a mother who actually cared about the kid would remember:
exactly when she saw her and for how long. But the writer and director
here would rather make nonsense of all her earlier protestations. For
them, the husband was just the "heavy," a typical domineering control
freak like those in any number of TV movies, and the daughter -- as a
friend I saw the film with put it -- was basically just a prop.I give it 4 stars for its evocation of the period and because I like
Cate Blanchett. In short, though: beautiful pictures, but a
conventional, slow-paced story, and an unfortunate tendency to stoop to
stereotypes. Once or twice.

"Please believe I would do anything to see you happy." Carol
(Blanchett) has been trying to hide who she is from everyone, including
her husband, for years. After she tells him the truth things start to
get worse. She finds comfort in a Therese (Mara) a young photographer
who seems to be the only one that understands her. When Carol's past
begins to catch up with her she is afraid it will effect Therese and
has a difficult decision to make. This is a movie to watch for the
acting. The acting is amazing in this, but the movie is agonizingly
slow moving. It is a character piece and I know that not much action is
expected though. The movie is well written and directed but I just had
a hard time really getting into it. Many people will like this I think
but just as many, or more, won't. A movie that may be for true
cinephilias only. Overall, not bad, little slow and is defiantly not
for everyone. I give this a B-.

A story of love and change, "Carol" was incredibly moving. The taboo
subject of sexuality during the 1950s is explored in this film and the
relationship between Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara)
is deep and endearing. Blanchett and Mara both gave amazing
performances in this film. Such an important subject and story to tell,
they did it with grace and compassion. Todd Haynes did a wonderful
capturing the varying emotions throughout this film as well. Nominated
for multiple Oscars, I can understand the Academy's approval of this
film. It was extremely well done and it's great to see films like this
that can open people minds and hearts to the definition of love.

Another LGBT film in this year's Oscar race, "Carol" may not have the
historical reference and implication that "The Danish Girl" does, but
the viewing experience is absolutely more satisfying.Nominated for Best Actress Academy Award, Cate Blanchett's performance
is both charismatic and exquisite. It is difficult to distinguish
whether Blanchett has become Carol, or vice versa. She is simply
mesmerizing, but for the film as a whole, can be a double-edged sword.
When Blanchett is on screen, she overshadows everything and everyone
around her, even the plot of the film becomes insignificant.In the presence of the superb Cate Blanchett, Oscar-nominated Rooney
Mara (for Best Supporting Actress) certainly holds her own. Her
performance is a delightful surprise to say the least. As the doe-eyed
young woman who was drawn Carol at first sight, Therese is the epitome
of young innocence and courage fueled by love. Most of the film is told
from her flashbacks, and it is through her eyes and lens that we
realize falling in love with Carol was simply inevitable.The pace of the film is slow, as Director Todd Haynes takes his time
with every eye contact, every pose, every dialogue. It's the
culmination of these delicate moments that make the emotions all the
more intense. In the final scene, as the camera cuts back and forth
between Therese's gaze and Carol's smile, the connection between them
is palpable; in that moment, their love transcends gender and social
boundaries.

'Carol' is a fine film. The juxtaposition of the lavish costumes and
production design with the grainy look of 16mm film sells the film's
old-fashioned aesthetic. It is a well-shot film that is pleasant to
look at. All of the individual performances are pretty good. The best part of the film is the opening sequence. The credits play
over a continuing shot of fifties New York accompanied by Carter
Burwell's fantastic piece 'Opening'. This shot brings us to a scene in
a restaurant. This is a flash-forward that we revisit later on in the
film. Our first sight of the main couple occurs when a man at the bar
looks around the restaurant and spots them at a table. In this shot,
Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) are sitting at a
table. Therese is sat facing away from the camera and towards Carol,
who we can see clearly. My immediate reaction to this sight was "Wow,
Cate Blanchett genuinely looks like she's in love." It felt real.Unfortunately, I didn't get this feeling from the rest of the film. I
couldn't feel any chemistry between Therese and Carol. Mara and
Blanchett do their best with what they are given, but they aren't given
enough. Their characters don't feel fleshed out. I didn't feel like I
knew them as people by the end. The film's technical achievements can
only lift a film so high. If you love this film then I'm glad, but I
can't love it when I couldn't grow attached to the characters. This is
especially a problem as this feels like a film driven more by character
than by story.Despite what I have said, this film didn't bore me. Mara and Blanchett
are both engaging actresses who command your attention even if they
aren't given enough to work with. The film is on the slow side but it
goes at the right pace for what director Todd Haynes and screenwriter
Phyllis Nagy were going for. Overall, it was an interesting experience
that felt a bit empty.You can see more reviews at

I really wanted to like this movie, to get into the lives of the
characters, the gorgeous recreation of that time and that place, but it
seemed more like I was watching a moving diorama, lovingly recreated,
kind of riffing off the early Mad Man vibe with just as much
substance....not much. I wanted everything to matter more than it
actually did. Yes, Blanchett is amazing, and I'm sure the book, when
written was important, but there was no fizz. Couldn't really figure
out why this mattered now. I lost the thread of the movie, more craft
than art. And what is this English-ication of everything, the state-
liness, the English actresses, as if this makes the movie more
important.

Todd Haynes ? Yeah I remember him . Something of an auteur when it
comes to independent film making , but just because someone is an
auteur it doesn't make them superior to the journeyman type of director
. Indeed auteur can defined as "A director who is somewhat
unimaginative in telling a visual narrative" . He also directed SAFE
one of the most frustrating films I've ever seen . With CAROL Haynes
directs a film featuring a lesbian love story . As the opening credits
rolled I also found out it was a Film 4 production . Todd Haynes ,
lesbians and Film 4 Productions . I don't want to sound like George
Dubya Bush but if there was such a thing as an axis of film evil this
might just be it!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! I'm very surprised then as to how much and how quickly CAROL drew me in
to the story . Of course it's somewhat predictable in the early stages
with a young shop worker Therese noticing and becoming infatuated by an
older woman called Carol but everything is done with a deft , delicate
slightness of touch it's difficult not to be caught up in the story .
This is down to Haynes and the two protagonists played by Rooney Mara
as Therese and Cate Blanchett as the titular Carol . It's rare that I
see a film where an actors expression says a thousand words but you're
able to instantly see thought and subtext being portrayed without a
single word being spoken . It's also rare for a film nowadays to be
poignant without lapsing in to manipulation and grief whoring It's not perfect . It gets a bit melodramatic towards the end and the
slow languid pace will undoubtedly put some people off but it's not a
film produced for the local multiplex . Likewise if the protagonists
had been a middle aged straight man and a hetrosexual young woman we'd
have an entirely different and possibly as unlikely story but let's
appreciate CAROL for what it is - subtle Oscar bait material that might
just surprise the Oacar board in 2016

Carol is the story of a young sales clerk in the 50ties that falls for
an older married woman.This movie is filled with beautiful images. Great sets, great costumes,
great cinematography. So for the eyes alone it is a feast.The story is told in a very subdued way but this gives it its beauty.
Its subtle, delicate and true. Its not a movie with great dramatic
scenes but one that is almost, though not quite, understated. I thought
it was beautiful in every way. A gem of a movie. True beauty instead of
forced drama. Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett are fantastic.If you like true beauty instead of high drama this is the movie for
you.

The film was beautiful, but there was barely a plot and it was soooo
slow. It was hard to relate to the characters who were very stereotyped
and not very sympathetic. Carol was predatory, and it was hard to see
what actually drew her to her "newfound" love, and vice versa. The only
thing the two had in common was being pretty. Carol was practically a
pedophile who found a naive victim (this would be unacceptable in a
heterosexual relationship, but is somehow acceptable here). Sarah
Paulson is a great actress but her character was shallow and never
developed. I found the film to be very boring and fell asleep towards
the end. Granted, I saw the last show of the day, but I doubt I would
have enjoyed it more if I went to the matinée.

These days, it's hard to be surprised by a love story in a film. There
shouldn't even be much of a surprise to the love story that forms the
heart and soul of CAROL  anyone who walks into the cinema will know
that this is The Movie In Which Cate Blanchett And Rooney Mara Play
Lesbians. And yet, Todd Haynes' masterful, intoxicating film unfolds in
a series of small, subtle surprises, culminating in one of the most
profoundly affecting romances ever committed to film.New York, in the early 1950s. Therese (Mara) is working as a shopgirl
in the toy section of a department store. She meets and serves dozens
of people, but only one catches her eye: Carol (Blanchett), a poised,
polished and seemingly perfect example of the many wives and mothers
who frequent the store. On Therese's recommendation, Carol buys a model
train set for her daughter Rindy: an unusual Christmas present for a
little girl that swiftly draws a connection between the two women.Over the next hour, CAROL shades colour and complexity into the world
in which Carol and Therese live. When they find each other again
through a pair of gloves misplaced by accident (or, perhaps, design),
the two women share lunch, and a tune played on a piano. Carol invites
Therese to her family home and, eventually, on a road trip that changes
everything. Therese confesses her love of photography, and begins to
ask awkward questions of Richard (Jake Lacy), her devoted, if somewhat
callous, boyfriend. Through it all, Carol's marriage to Harge (Kyle
Chandler) crumbles apart, despite the fierce love they share for their
daughter. For much of its running time, Haynes' film  an adaptation of Patricia
Highsmith's groundbreaking second novel, The Price Of Salt  unfolds at
a deliberately unhurried pace that might alienate some, and bore
others. Dramatic outbursts are kept to a bare minimum, chiefly coming
from a raging Harge as he tries ever more desperately to cajole (or
bully) Carol into remaining by his side. The growing tenderness between
Carol and Therese deepens, not through flowery confessions of undying
love, but in the exchanging of tentative glimpses, glances and smiles. And yet, the heartbreaking magic woven throughout CAROL comes from
precisely these understated, measured moments. The aching, all-
consuming affection between Carol and Therese blossoms in the film's
pockets of silence, as they study each other in a mirror, or share a
conspiratorial smile over breakfast. Threats of death and danger
surface, but in purely emotional terms, resonating all the more
powerfully for never being literal. Indeed, it's only when the film
slips into its devastating final act  which simultaneously manages to
warm hearts and shatter souls  that one begins to realise just how
bewitching a spell CAROL has cast in the silences and in-betweens.To top it all off, there is so much at work in Phyllis Nagy's
wonderfully spare script that CAROL practically begs to be excavated,
pored over and studied at length. The love story at its heart works
because CAROL is a film about two women who are making their way
towards each other through a world that often refuses to understand,
accept or acknowledge them: not just as potential lovers, but also as
people. Entire novels can be written about the film's excellent
feminist and queer credentials, particularly when it comes to shining a
spotlight on its women and their relationships (including a powerful
supporting turn by Sarah Paulson as Abby, Carol's best friend and
erstwhile paramour). It seems profoundly unnecessary to say that CAROL's trump card is
Blanchett. It should be self-evident, a given  after all, for as long
as she has made movies, she has unquestionably been the best thing
about any film she's in. And yet, she is completely transcendent here.
In Blanchett's hands, Carol manages to be unearthly  an exalted
goddess on a pedestal  and utterly, completely human at the same time.
In a wonderfully layered final scene with Harge, Carol's controlled
composure cracks apart, revealing the punishing depth of the pain she
must undergo in order to be true to herself. Blanchett conveys it all
with heartbreak to spare, radiating love, joy, misery or despair with
barely perceptible changes in expression.Mara, meanwhile, gives her finest performance to date. Her Therese
lingers quietly at the edges of her own life, not so much pushing
limits as slipping past them to find her own way. It's hard to shake
the feeling, though, that Mara remains outclassed by her co-star.
Unlike Carol, Therese never completely coalesces as a character in her
own right. To be fair to Mara, that's partly due to one of the script's
few flaws. In a film that is otherwise so subtle and considered, we are
too often told rather than shown that Carol finds Therese irresistible.
(There is no such problem in believing that anyone could fall head over
heels for Carol.) Nevertheless, the chemistry between Blanchett and Mara burns, slowly
but brightly. The electricity between them throws off more sparks as
the film goes on  to the point that audiences will find their hearts
stuttering and stopping at the tiniest of moments: when Carol presses
her hand lightly on Therese's shoulder, or when their eyes meet,
finally, across a crowded room.In all of these elements, and in ways big and small, CAROL constantly
surprises. It could have been ripely melodramatic; instead, it lingers
in a key of melancholy realism. In another universe, Carol might have
been more manipulative, Harge more villainous, Therese more coquettish,
the love story less compelling and more titillating. The film's themes
could have overwhelmed its central romance. And yet, in every gorgeous
frame (composed with impeccable grace by cinematographer Edward
Lachman), CAROL sings of its love story: one that is as sweet as it is
bitter, as simple as it is complex, and as real as it is magical.

Very beautiful movie, however there is zero character development. For
any book, or movie to work, We have to "care" about the characters.This flick gives us precious little to care about one way or the other.Why does Carol have a loveless marriage? We never find out! Why does
does Therese live with some guy? (just some guy, We never find any
depth to either of the main characters) The Movie concentrates on how
unfair things were for lesbians in the 1950's, and that is tragic, but
if We don't care about either character, it's a pointless exercise! A
very disappointing film. Hardly worth the time to watch it!Current screenwriters and directors assume if they have an "issue"
(lesbian treatment in the dark ages of 1950) - then they have a Movie!
They don't! Todd Haynes gives us a beautiful failure!

"Carol" rates as one of the most romantic films of 2015. But whereas
most romantic movies involve some form of love triangle (as per the
recent "Brooklyn") this film is more of a convoluted square - a 'love
trapezium' perhaps - with significant lesbian content. In fact the film
bears many similarities to "Brooklyn" - both films are set around the
late 40's / early 50's; both are set in New York; and both concern the
love interest of a department store shop-girl. There though the
similarities end. Cate Blanchett plays the rich and privileged Carol Belivet with Rooney
Mara ("The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo") as the shop-girl Therese, with
broader photojournalism ambitions. Therese becomes instantly attracted
to her in a US society much less tolerant of homosexuality than current
times. In fact in a era before 'gay bars' it is quite mystical how
these relationships ever got voiced and consummated (Carol - "Ask me
the questions.... Please"). Carol's similar passion, with childhood friend Abby (Sarah Paulson from
"12 Years a Slave"), has driven a wedge through her marriage to the
(not unreasonably) frustrated Harge (Kyle Chandler from "Super 8" and
"Zero Dark Thirty"). Their young daughter Rindy (twins Sadie and Kk
Helm) is the pawn in the ongoing marital battle. The film is exquisitely put together. Let's start for once with the
music by Carter Burwell ("Twilight", "Fargo") which grabs the attention
from the first frame, a luscious melody of cello and piano that sets
the tone of the film perfectly. Add in to the mix a plethora of music
from the era and you have a beautifully dynamic soundtrack that I would
like to see up for an Oscar nomination.While I've never personally been a mad fan of Cate Blanchett's acting,
here her affected manner suits the role to a T. But the real star turn
of the piece is Rooney Mara. Channeling a young Audrey Hepburn, Mara is
utterly compelling to look at as she rides the roller-coaster of
Patricia Highsmith's story ("The Price of Salt"). For me, an Oscar
nomination shoe-in.Between them, the pair build up an extraordinary sexual tension
throughout the film with the camera taking long lingering shots of
Carol's fingers and body. This tension rises steadily and relentlessly
until the inevitable scene of release, which is done with lots of flesh
and eroticism but also with real gentleness and beauty, reminiscent of
"Desert Hearts". (Mara also looks gorgeous: as Therese opens her gown,
Carol breathes "I've never looked like that" and you can here all of
the women in the audience silently agreeing with her!)There's a significant twist in the tale though which you don't see
coming, and one which adds a different dimension to the film (albeit
one that feels as a viewer rather unwelcome).The art department also supplies fodder for the Oscar cannon. Legendary
costume designer and multiple Academy Award winner Sandy Powell
delivers fantastic period costumes. And both the cinematography and
film editing by Edward Lachman and Affonso Gonçalves respectively is
gorgeous: a scene of Therese on a train panning through steamy windows
to her arrival at home by taxi is a masterclass in composition and
editing. In the director's chair is Todd Haynes, none of whose previous
cinema releases (dating back to 1991), I recognize. but he's nailed
this one. Whilst the subject matter might prove challenging for those who feel
uncomfortable watching a bit of 'girl on girl action' the film is a
beautiful love story. A film deserving respect and recommended for
anyone who has a beating heart, and particularly (I would imagine,
given the book's loyal following) those in all female relationships.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of

An eight-year gap from his last feature movie I'M NOT THERE (2007),
during which he dabbles in the TV sphere to direct a quintessential
five-part miniseries MILDRED PIERCE (2011) starring Kate Winslet, Todd
Haynes is back in the groove. Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's
pioneering novel THE PRICE OF SALT published in 1952 by screenwriter
Phyllis Nagy, who wrote the first draft as early as in 1997, CAROL
makes headway as the most audacious and empowering addition to the US
queer cinema, notably to the rather barren lesbian territory.New York, 1952 , Therese Belivet (Mara), a shop-girl whose real
interest is photography, meets Carol Aird (Blanchett), an elegant woman
who is experiencing an unpleasant divorce with her possessive husband
Harge (Chandler). Therese's presence sheds a light in her life just as
hers does in Therese's. Their romance has been intensified through an
itinerant journey they embark on during the new year, but the thorny
legal procedure to fight the custody of her young daughter forces Carol
to unilaterally put their relationship on hold, an ultimate question
remains what a downcast Therese will do when a second chance emerges?Predominantly, CAROL is an all-around artistic treasure, the incredible
period art production, under the low-key, slightly desaturated tint,
precisely reconstructs an alluringly sentimental ambiance of the era to
foreground the exquisite undercurrents experienced by Carol and
Therese; the sophistication of Carol's gorgeous wardrobe and make-up
contrasts the self-revealing honesty and consciousness of Therese's
drabber outfits and unadorned countenance; Edward Lachman's
breathtaking cinematography is quaintly evocative to reflect Carol and
Therese's understated emotional orbits, his sleight-of-hand is at its
most potent with those shots behind glasses, immaculately sublimates
the blurry equivocation of human's impenetrable sentiments, and the
impact multiplies with Carter Burwell's unobtrusive but permeating
score.The two leading performances are priceless, it is heartfelt restraint
versus enigmatic swank, where the unfathomable attraction burgeons
mutually, Mara and Blanchett diligently engage in their two- hander,
with minute gestures and body languages and expressional finesse.
Blanchett is graceful, alluring, and indecisive, the dramatic soliloquy
about her resolution of the custody is beyond question one of the
highlights of her illustrious career; whereas Mara is stolid on the
surface, watchful and unapologetically true to her feelings, more
admirably conveys her true grit against the tentacles of a prejudiced
society which reaches into every nook and cranny of her and Carol's
lives. In the supporting category, Sarah Paulson as Abby, Carol's
confidant, is the ballast of their perilous affair, apart from an
awkward former love identity, which could make the mind-game more
intriguing if her role were extended.An out-and-out victory from Haynes and his cast, CAROL sweeps with
virtuosity as an compelling indictment to a jaundiced society and an
ode to the undying strength of love, and beckons a bullish prospect for
Haynes' next project, reportedly to be a reunion with another muse
Julianne Moore in WONDERSTRUCK, based on the book by Brian Selznick.

Carol is tells the plot of how a older lesbian woman and an younger
woman get in love, but it sets up difficulties as the younger woman is
finding herself, and the older woman is having troubles with marriage.
Cate Blanchett is great as always, Oscar worthy. But in my opinion,
Rooney Mara gives a good performance but her character is really bland.
Not really that interesting, but changes over time. Her character
(Therese) is really silent, not a lot to say and basically says yes to
anything. Its interesting how a character can change over time, but she
really only changes at the end, not exactly her personality. Carol's
character is even more interesting as she was married, but now she is
divorcing, now that she knows inside of her that she is a lesbian. The
cinematography is good, but sometimes can be crowded and sometimes the
long and wide shots were necessary for certain shots, but since the
cinematography is not really wide, its hard to see sometimes. The
story, as interesting as it could have been, has no real substance as
its just a love story and it can get repetitive and overusing at times.
The subplot of the divorce of Carol is not handled well as sometimes
you understand the husband, and you are willing to see him succeed
instead of the lead character. It lasted for way too long, and it does
not have enough emotional punch for the audience to care for Therese as
she is disoriented and does not understand how to feel human emotions;
she is way too distracted and her personal life its not interesting.
The photographs she takes even that are good, she admits that they are
not good, but it just gets so repetitive when she complains about
everything and makes stupid excuses. The direction and cinematography
its good, Carols performance is great but the substance of the story
does not really impact the audience as well as it could have been.

Against a backdrop of modern progress towards same-sex marriage, the
1950s story of two women finding love in each other has a strangely
out-of-date feel that lingers throughout Carol (2015). It's a beautiful
period piece that meticulously re-creates the fine detail of the era
and is an adaptation of The Price of Salt (1952), a novel about the
love that could not be named before the sexual revolution. Cate
Blanchett is Carol, the experienced older seductress who is going
through a messy divorce and custody battle, while Rooney Mara is
Therese, the young novice who is swept away by the attractive and
wealthy socialite. The tension between their acting styles is
unsettling. Blanchett's tightly over-controlled emotions appear
shallow, even when the two of them are behind closed doors, while Mara
slides gracefully across a broad emotional spectrum with skillful
nuance and natural radiance. It's a slow story and their only sex
scene, far from erotic, is clinical like many of Carol's responses to
Therese.Their love affair inevitably hits male hurdles, and at least some
narrative energy is generated not by what happens between Carol and
Therese, but between them and the hostile bullies who are husband and
boyfriend. The male egos are tortured by the possibility that their
women could prefer women, and their attempts to control with veiled
aggression put todays domestic violence dispute into an historical
frame. The legal system was equally brutish and so favoured men that
women had no hope of keeping their children once they were tarnished as
"immoral". But despite star billing, meticulously crafted sets and
evocative soft-focus atmospherics, this is one Blanchett film that
struggles to inspire.

Regardless of how one reacts to a film by Todd Haynes, what is
unquestionable is how beautiful his films are, the last ones having
been lovingly shot by Edward Lachman, and in his two leads, Cate
Blanchett and Rooney Mara, he finds the perfect chemistry for a moving
love story. Two women who find themselves involved in a quiet romance
while one is enraptured in a troubling divorce, fighting for the
custody of her precious daughter.I appreciated the subtlety and patience in the way Todd Haynes directs
the film. The relationship between Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese
(Rooney Mara) is a slowly developed until it reaches its pinnacle
halfway through. Cate Blanchett is superb, she comes across as a
classic star from the Golden era of Hollywood who's traveled through
time to grace our screens, chic and graceful, whereas Rooney Mara uses
her facial expressions to describe what is going through Therese
internally. At first I thought her line reading came across as stilted
until I realized it complemented the character's shyness and fear of
saying what she truly felt. "Carol" forces the viewer to wait for the emotional pay-off, it isn't
about indulging us with easy emotion, and it is the right choice as
"Carol" succeeds in being poignant and moving when heartbreak is found.

Hailed as a top Oscar contender this year in numerous categoriesbest
director, film, actress, and cinematographyCarol is the story of a
wealthy but unhappily married woman (played by Cate Blanchett) who
embarks on a relationship with a shopgirl (Rooney Mara) she meets by
chance. Unquestionably, it's a period piece (nice Packards!), written
by author Patricia Highsmith, herself a lesbian, who wrote high-class
mysteries like The Talented Mr. Ripley, and it would have had
considerably more shock valueand prompted more audience reflectionin
its 1952 novel version, The Price of Salt. In a story set in that era
and with the social class differences involved, there are lots of ways
for this relationship to go wrong. Worse, with a husband willing to
play his acecustody of his and Carol's four-year-old daughter
Rindythe stakes are high. Yet, I didn't find this movie either
engaging or revelatory. Of course Blanchett is terrific, as always,
though even she may underplay the role of Carol through most of the
film. Mara, as the initially childlike Therese Belivet, is so
indeterminate that it's hard to root for her happiness (what would that
require, exactly?) and even harder to see what the glamorous,
sophisticated Carol sees in her. Perhaps director Todd Haynes and
screenwriter Phyllis Nagy hoped that, by making Mara more or less a
cipher, viewers would be free to pin their own romantic hopes and
dreams on her. In the New York Times, critic A.O.Scott calls Carol "a
study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros . . .
(giving) emotional and philosophical weight to what might be a
perfectly banal question: What do these women see each in each other."
That was my question, all right. Therese says she is almost will-less,
that the complications in her life arise because all she ever does is
say "yes," and the film takes on the challenge of imbuing her most
important affirmation with real meaning. In a season where we've seen
so many excellent high-drama films, this one, to me, did less than I
would have liked it to. I give it a B-.

To paraphrase Ursula Le Guin: This is not Patricia Highsmith's book.
This is Todd Haynes' film. It is a gorgeous film.I have only good things to say about this film, as far as aesthetics,
atmosphere and film craft goes. The photography is stunningly beautiful
and the use of colour is impressive and effective. The film manages to
catch the perceived atmosphere of the Fifties and the romance of the
script. The performances from both actresses are quite good, reminding
of the old classics. The last scene, with its deceptively low-key
acting, deserves to be included in an anthology.However, the film isn't perfect. I don't know whether this is the
scriptwriter's of the director's fault, but the adaptation played too
fast and loose with Patricia Highsmith's book, losing its essence. The
delicate tensions and suspense of the book were gone and the film
suffers for that, losing its potential impact and leaving behind an
under-taste of disappointment.It is not a bad film, far from it, but I have the feeling that it could
be far better and more powerful.

For me the greatest love stories don't have a difference, they have
chemistry. Just having the couple in your movie be lesbian women
doesn't necessarily make them interesting. That's what holds 'Carol'
back for me. Not enough time and effort is actually put into making us
believe and care for the lead character's relationship, we are just
simply supposed to accept it. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara have been nominated for Academy Awards
for Best Actress and and Best Supporting Actress respectively. They
never blew me away and I suspect it was more a case of getting the nod
for going out of their comfort zones. They can say they felt they had
great chemistry all they want, but what came across in the finished
product speaks for itself. I suspect the Academy is smart enough to see
this and consequently neither will get the win.There was a little bit of an uproar when the nominations were announced
that 'Carol' hadn't been given a Best PIcture nod. To the people upset
I would ask what exactly did it do to separate itself from every other
film of 2015? Be about lesbians, would be about the only convincing
answer I would accept. Is that enough to get you a nod? I would hope
not. It's not really a bad film, it just comes across run of the mill
and forgettable. The best love stories leave you caring about the
future of the relationship. For these two, I couldn't have cared less.

Greetings again from the darkness. When Patricia Highsmith first wrote
her novel "The Price of Salt", she had it published in 1952 under a
pseudonym (Claire Morgan). This was a sign of the unforgiving social
conventions of the era, which also play a key role in the story. At the
time, no author would publicly admit to writing a book about lesbian
lovers, much less admit their participation in such an affair.
Highsmith's novel is the source material for director Todd Haynes'
bookend to his stellar 2002 film Far From Heaven. In that film, Dennis
Quaid's character struggles with his secret life as a gay man while
married to Julianne Moore. In this new movie, Cate Blanchett is a
married upper class socialite trying to deal with her true feelings for
the opposite sex, while fighting to not lose custody of her young
daughter.Haynes has a real feel for attraction  what causes two people to be
attracted to each other, and how do they handle it? He re-teams with
cinematographer Ed Lachman to create yet another beautiful film with
camera work, sets, costumes and a score (Carter Burwell) that
complement the romance depicted by the two outstanding lead actresses:
Cate Blanchett (Carol) and Rooney Mara (Therese). Ms. Blanchett is a
2-time Oscar winner (5 time nominee), and has become one of the few
actors who make each of their films a must-see. She is a true force
here as she sweeps into the captivating first sequence (a wonderful
long take) and has her first interaction with wide-eyed shopgirl
Therese as the two dance together through words and innuendo. It may be
the best scene of the movie  at least up to the stunning final shot.At its core, this is a pretty simple romance of two opposite worlds
colliding at a time when their attraction was just not tolerated.
1950's social conventions, being what they were, meant Carol's husband
(Kyle Chandler) could use her sexual preferences as evidence of
immorality in his fight to gain sole custody of their daughter.
Cinematically, it's much more about style. Carol is a beautiful
mink-wearing work of art, while Therese is seeking her place in the
world, while trying to make sense of her feelings. Every scene drips
with style  the cars, the clothes, the restaurants; even cigarettes
become a fashion accessory between the fingers of Carol.Carol and Therese take a road trip, and it's not until Iowa that the
relationship is consummated  a scene that finds neither actress shying
away from the moment. Fittingly, this occurs in a motel located in
Waterloo  leaving little doubt the turn this story will take.Supporting work is provided by Sarah Paulson ("American Horror Story")
as Carol's friend and ex-lover, Jake Lacey ("The Office") as Therese's
would-be suitor, John Magaro (The Big Short) as her friend and
supporter, and Cory Michael Smith ("Gotham") as a double-life salesman.
But this show belongs to Blanchett and Mara. They are terrific together
 capturing the unspoken, subtle gestures required by the repressive
era they find themselves. Mara's character is difficult to describe,
but most intriguing to watch and absolutely vital to the message.Phyllis Nagy adapted Ms. Highsmith's novel (which was re-published in
1990 under her own name), and her care for the material is clear. Todd
Haynes then worked his magic with the look of the film, and the two
lead actresses deliver a clinic in nuance and dealing with oppression.
As it plays, the strength of the film is with the internal struggles
faced by the two lead characters. It leaves us to wonder if the film
might have been more powerful had it delved a bit deeper into what the
characters would have faced from the outside world.

Before I ever saw this film, I heard the NPR interview of Cate
Blanchett about it. In it, there's a part in which she essentially says
that the characters in the movie express "fluid sexuality" and that she
relates because she has had relationships with women before. I assume
that means "I kissed a girl in college when I was drunk" but you know.
Whatever.The rise of this hyper-progressive gay-but-not flavor of LGBT culture
has created a wave of "gay movies" (movies created with a gay audience
in mind) that try very, very hard not to be Gay Movies. This is evident
in the fact that they never actually say lesbian at any point in the
film, and Rooney Mara's character essentially says "I'm not A GAY I'm
just a normal girl that happened to fall in love with a woman."
Basically, they want us to shell out money to see this movie because
Cate Blanchett has sex with a woman but didn't want to make it Too Gay
in case that alienated straight people's money. That movie was the
epitome of this and it irritated me throughout the entire movie.That aside, it was technically not a bad movie at all. Lots of pretty
shots and the costume designs were great. The performances were strong
and while I wasn't overly impressed with the story it wasn't terrible
necessarily. A very technically okay movie all in all.Definitely not a bad movie, but not really a good one either. If you
want to watch a gay movie with a happy ending check out Boys in the
Band, or But I'm a Cheerleader!. Both better movies than this,
honestly. And one of them has RuPaul as a main character

Carol (2015) was directed by Todd Haynes. It stars Cate Blanchett as
Carol Aird, a wealthy, married woman, and Rooney Mara as Therese
Belivet, a young, inexperienced department store clerk. The film is set
in late 1952 and 1953.The two women meet when Carol comes into a department store to find a
special doll as a Christmas present for her daughter. Because the doll
is unavailable, Therese suggests a Lionel train instead. The
relationship begins there, but it doesn't stop there. For some movies, the reviewer can travel deep into the plot, but not
for this one. As the relationship between Carol and Therese develops,
the story moves in interesting and unpredictable ways. It's better if
you see the movie, and find out what happens, rather than just reading
about it in a review.Cate Blanchett, at 45, is one of the most beautiful women on the screen
today. However, for some reason, in this film she looks almost dowdy.
Granted, some of the fashions worn in 1952 look dowdy to us now, but I
think the problem is deeper than that.Director Haynes is clearly fascinated by Rooney Mara's appearance. (To
paraphrase, "She's OK if you like talented, slender women with large
eyes and impossible cheekbones.") Haynes simply can't keep the camera
off her. We see her face in closeup, middle distance, and long
distance. We see it through house windows and car windows (with and
without streaks of rain), and mirrors. She's Audrey Hepburn for the
21st Century.The film is called "Carol," but it should be called "Therese," because
Mara is the centerpiece of the movie. It's not fair to Cate Blanchett,
but that's show business. Blanchett, as Executive Producer as well as
star, probably could have pushed Haynes to move matters in a different
direction. However, the film we see has Mara as the star. You'll have
to decide whether that's good news or bad news.Incidentally, Haynes insists that we know the period in which the film
is set. We get endless shots of men in fedoras, everyone smoking, dial
telephones, phone booths, and period automobiles. We even hear
Eisenhower's 1953 inaugural address playing on the radio. OK--got it.
It's the fifties. The purpose of all this--I assume--is not nostalgia.
It's making sure that we realize that what was thought abnormal then
would not be seen as abnormal today. If everything were fine, there'd
be no plot.We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It
will work equally well on the small screen. It's definitely worth
seeking out and watching.Extra stuff about Lionel trains: when Therese suggests an electric
train for Carol's daughter, she certainly sent her in the right
direction from today's perspective. However, that suggestion would have
been unusual--almost bizarre--in 1952. In 1952, girls wanted trains,
but their mothers wouldn't buy them. Boys got trains, girls got dolls.Going beyond that, when Therese suggested the specific Lionel set for
the little girl, she selected a beauty. It was Lionel's #2190W Santa Fe
Super Speedliner. Therese tells Carol that this was a limited edition,
made especially for the store. That's possible too, because the store
in which Carol works could be a stand-in for Macy's, and Macy's did
have special Lionel sets that were only available in the store. If you
want to see what the set looked like, here's a YouTube link:

One of the best movies of the year. An enchanting love story with
actual deepness and heartfelt emotion that focuses on telling a story
and not just pulling on the heartstrings just for the sake of it as
many dramas of this kind tend to do.We have seen gay "prohibited" love stories before, many of those films
just fall into melodrama and boredom because they just focus on the
problematic of freedom and completely forget the characters in the
first place. What Carol does is using that "prohibited" aspect of the
story as a background. It is never fully mentioned or explored in the
film, it is just there and we all know it is there. By trusting the
audience with that and not banging you over the head with morality
lesson, the filmmakers manage to achieve some of the best sexual
tension I have ever experienced in a film. Believe me there were times
where I just had to look away from the screen to catch my breath. It
was that effective.There is a fascinating look at seduction and instinctual love, and I am
talking in general not even in the context of a gay 1950s story. Those
scenes where Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett just go on for five minutes
in a room alone were a treasure that culminated in one of the best sex
scenes I have seen in modern cinema. A sex scene that actually evokes
emotion and tell something really interesting about the characters.Now again all of this works thanks to how the filmmakers decide to tell
this story, but also thanks to two brilliantly utilized film
ingredients: the score and the photography. The score is one of year's
very best, and that's saying something since this year we were graced
with endless good scores, but it is really used as a storytelling tool
that makes the love story work emotionally even more thanks to how it
is placed throughout. The photography also, because it uses close ups
to really get intimate with the characters and ultimately make those
scenes work at their best.The best has yet to come however. Rooney Mara in this film is the
reason why I love cinema and acting. She is so good in the film that I
just wanted to go there and give her a kiss to thank her for such a
flawlessly involving performance. Cate Blanchett is magnetic of course,
but she isn't as deeply fascinating as Mara is. She has a scene in the
film, in a train, which melted my heart in sadness. Fantastic work.I have to admit that I am not yet clear on how much I really liked the
film. I would really love to watch it another time very soon. I may
think that this is due to the fact that those scenes with Mara or Mara
and Blanchett together were so good that the rest of the film didn't
really follow through. The second half becomes pretty straightforward
until the absorbing conclusion, but it just lacks the thematic
undertones that were so relevant and touching in the first half.Anyways, this is a very emotional and mature piece, a fantastic
portrayal of a love story that puts its characters and story first and
doesn't worry about Oscar bait stuff and Oscar scenes and also a very
inspiring movie for screen writing and direction.

Therese Belivet: "I don't know what I want. How could I know what I
want if I say yes to everything?".Carol is set in 1950s New York, a department-store clerk dreams of a
better life for himself and finds himself falling for an older, married
woman.Before Carol was even release, it had a lot of Oscar talk with the two
main leads and the story itself. It's one of those period piece movies
that people start talking about how many awards it's going to win (It's
mostly Gold Derby predictions) and not actually talking about the movie
itself, only the awards and it's quite sad when I think about it. But
all that a side, I've been anticipating Carol for awhile now, just
because of the two main stars and the beautiful teaser trailer that got
me interested in seeing it. And after seeing Carol I am lost with words
right now, I mean wow. It's without a doubt the best movie of the year.Cate Blanchett continues to amaze me and I don't think it's going to
stop anytime soon. Shes tremendous in everything movie I've seen her in
and in Carol she amazed me even more. Blanchett was absolutely
phenomenal in this movie as she delivered such a powerful performance.
It's by far her best performance and movie (In my personal opinion). I
basically ran out of things to say about her, since I always say the
same good things about her performance. I think sometimes things are
too brilliant to be put into words and it's best to be watched.Rooney Mara has come along way, because if you look at her track record
of all the movies shes been in. She can star in a bad movie like the
2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street and then later appear in The
Social Network. Same thing can be said this year as she was in "Pan"
which was a massive piece of crap and she was so bad in that movie, but
not here, because Mara gives a stunning and brilliant performance. Mara
and Blanchett both deliver a stellar performance and both of them had
great chemistry, I mean it was really touching and quite beautiful to
watch.With a movie like this you would think the romance between the two
would be overly sloppy or repetitive like some romantic movies, but not
this one. There's only a few scenes in this movie where one of them say
"I love you" but that's it and it's never repeated. The thing I love
about this movie is that the romance didn't feel force or cliché. The
one thing I can't stand in romance movies is where the two lovers talk
about how much they love each other and why they love each other, I
mean screen writing like that is just the worse, but Carol avoids all
that and goes for a creative way of showing the romance that's best to
be seen and felt. There's a scene in this movie that's personally my
favorite scene of this year so far, and that's when the two of them are
in the car going through a highway tunnel. Then we get to see Rooney
Mara character (Therese) point of view as she looks at Carol and you as
an audience member get to see what makes Carol so special in Therese's
eyes. The scene itself has no dialogue, it was beautifully shot and
it's short but wonderful. It may not mean a lot to some people but to
me it dose and I wish we had more film making like this, because it's
an original and brilliant way of showing human connection, I mean it's
much better than the character's repeatedly saying "I love you" to each
other.Todd Haynes did an excellent job directing this movie. Everything that
a good director should do in movies is what Todd Haynes dose here. He's
the glue to all of this and he brilliantly crafted such a powerful
film.The cinematography in the movie was magnificent as it had the perfect
shots that fitted the story really well. The art direction, the
costumes, and the writing were flawless.Now for the flaws: My only flaw in this movie has to be that some of
the supporting characters were pretty forgettable and could have easily
be cut out of the movie.Overall Carol is a beautifully crafted movie that tells an emotional
story that's so nailed down to reality. It's a movie worth seeing if
you haven't checked it out yet.

Super-beautiful people (Galadriel meets Audrey Hepburn) gets in love in
a painfully slow tempo.. I fell asleep.... The only really interesting
thing was to guess what the the next spectacular outfit would look
like.... No criticism to the main actors, they made their roles
splendid! But... The script would be enough for an interesting short
film but totally insufficient for a whole movie. Interesting theme in a
less permitting time but today just a rather boring love story told in
slow motion. I really would have seen more complicated story, a more
fulfilling view how society looked at homosexuality. Both regarding
women and men. Which from what I have understood was rather different.

As my "5" rating indicates, I didn't think this was a "bad" movie.
However, it is disappointing and frustrating when this has been
heralded as one of the best films of 2015, and it's not even close. Was
I supposed to be blown away by showing a lesbian relationship taking
place in 1952 America? Yes, I "get" that a lesbian relationship in 1952
was extremely risky. Maybe if a film like this was released in the
1950's, I would have been blown away by it, but it was released in
2015. As I was watching this movie, I kept thinking, "if this was about
a heterosexual relationship rather than a lesbian relationship, would
other people still think this was interesting?" I believe they wouldn't
be interested in it. There really isn't much happening. Not only that, it is also very clichéd. The opening scene of Mara and
Blanchett...I just knew they were going to revisit that scene at the
end, but this time, it would, "mean so much more to us." And at the
very end, when we're supposed to wonder what Blanchett is thinking?
Another cliché, and no surprise at all.The only thing about this film that stands out is Rooney Mara's
performance. If she gets Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actress, I
think she'll be a favorite, and she'll deserve to be one. I have little
doubt this film will receive a number of Oscar nominations, but
honestly, with the exception of Mara, it doesn't deserve to be
nominated, and certainly should not win anything.

I wish that more films of this caliber would be brought to the screen.
I wish that Hollywood would dedicate more money to art and less to the
mindlessly sensational. "Carol" raises my hopes for the future of
motion pictures. The film is a love story of the most classic kind.
There is nothing new or striking in the plot. It is as old as life
itself. Rather, the film exquisitely, delicately, beautifully,
romantically, artistically and heartbreakingly portrays two people
falling in love and then facing the challenges that their love faces.
The acting of the leads is, I believe, in a class far above the norm.
It is inspiring and should, I believe, be aspired to. The film ends
with a subtle moment of beauty so powerful that I can only describe it
as a sledge-hammer to the heart. I give "Carol" my highest
recommendation.

I've never ever think about writing a review but this movie!! Is
everything. I mean this should've won an Oscar for the Best Actor
"Carol/Cate" And Best soundtracks! Because seriously this movie is all
about the music and they were Masterpieces The sad part is this movie
isn't allowed in Middle East, because it's about love between lesbians
and it's against our religion, that's really sad so I purchased it from
ITunes and I love it. This movie wasn't based on only sexual scenes
like other lesbians movies, this was full of emotions and feelings Also
the silence between Carol&There's was perfect and gave me a lot of
feelings Rooney "There's" was so good at the good girl character... And
of course my elegant and most breathtaking women ever Cate "Carol" she
was perfect for the character and I'm so in love with her and the way
she looks at There's I guess this is the most beautiful lesbians movie
I've ever seen, I do like the fact that it's about feelings. At the end
of the movie I cried a lot , I felt so sad because it ended... And I
would really love to see Carol2 even if there isn't a second part from
the novel This is the most beautiful movie in 2015

Todd Haynes has invented a new type of film in the 21st century. He
returns to classic style filmmaking that focuses both on its subjects
and the art of the film. "Carol" is an eloquent kind of film, boring to
most, but extraordinary to some. "Carol" tells a story of bitter
loneliness and a difficult love between an older woman named Carol
(Cate Blanchett) and a lost younger woman named Therese (Rooney Mara).
Haynes develops the relationship in a natural way, not focusing on the
fact that the women are gay, but rather showing them as human beings
who fall in love just like anyone else. Haynes nails that time period
of the 1950s, uses perfect costumes and production to bring you alive
in the classic time. Cate Blanchett gives a classy performance, playing
a woman who is somewhat cliché for the time, but in a good way. It's
Rooney Mara who steals the show, portraying a young woman suffering
from the struggles of society and isolating herself from the rest of
the world. Rooney Mara digs into your emotions and takes a piece of you
with her amazing acting. With Phyllis Nagy's detailed, thought-out
script, Todd Haynes puts together the pieces to bring a new romantic
classic that transports us back in an unfamiliar world.

I think "Carol" is the kind of movie that only Cineasts will truly
appreciate. I am not writing this with a disrespectful intention, it is
just the way it is from what I've seen in different review sections.
There is nothing bad about saying "this is not my cup of
tea,because..", but I've seen a lot of people who try to deny and
discredit this films visual and musical beauty as well as the
impeccable directing. I was inclined to give this a 10 if it wasn't for
some flaws in credibility and character relationships. This is the kind
of storytelling and directing where you have to fully invest yourself
into it, you have to pay attention to the details and the nuances in
every aspect. One of these aspects is the incredible acting, lead by
Cate Blanchett. Her performance is by far the best in the movie, she is
simply put the perfect fit for her character. It is hard to explain,
her portray of Carol just felt so real. This story focuses on
characters and their relationships, so there are no true outbursts of
wild and loud acting. Its the details in facial expression and gestures
that make the movie and actors credible. Rooney Mara is also good, but
relies on her beautiful face and eyes a little too much. That said, she
does make you feel for her in terms of the difficult and emotionally
confusing situation she is in. You can sense the chemistry between
them, because Maras character is not searching for any kind of
relationship. It just happens to her, and its shown in (almost) visual
poetry. The rest of the cast is a perfect addition to the main
storyline, especially Kyle Chandler. The splendid cinematography,
lighting and directing make the 1950s come back to life. Everything
from the costume design to the makeup and music is so detailed that I
knew someone put a lot of effort and, most importantly, love into it.
The movie is also giving us a great impression of the 1950s conformity
and the situation of gay people without going overboard and trying to
make you feel bad for them in this aspect. It is very subtle and does
not tell you how you're supposed to feel. The only thing that weakened
the films impact was the relationship between Carol and her daughter
which was not presented in a convincing way and made a decision in the
later stages of the film a little questionable. There is one last thing
that makes this a wonderful experience: The soundtrack by Carter
Burwell. It is a stroke of genius! I cant recommend it enough. It is
one of the most fitting pieces of film music in recent years and, in my
opinion, the best one this season. Amazing. I absolutely admire the
passion and subtlety of "Carol", it is a visual and cinematic magnum
opus. The acting and screenplay is fantastic, I highly recommend it.
Thank you for reading

I really enjoyed how the first scene interlinks with the closing of the
film- like something from The Sixth Sense; Brief Encounter or a
Hitchcock classic.Despite being set over 60 years ago, it is modern in the sense of
having leading female actors and men only being the support.The slow and intense build up leaves you on the edge of the seat and
the nigh on 2 hour long film passed by in no time.I am not sure why the film was named Carol as it was Cate Blanchett's
character was not really the star of the film but obviously she was the
better known actress but both played their roles so very well.A must see- even we heterosexual blokes will enjoy it

Therese Belivet, a worker in a toy store spots Carol Aird, a divorced
mother from across the store. The two engage with eye contact, their
love story begins from then on. Featuring a great cast with Cate Blanchett who is Intimidating at first
but loving as we know her and Rooney Mara who is unsure and ambiguous
at first and later giving into her emotions. Two great actors but weak
chemistry between the two throughout the film Things really start to heat up until halfway, but what about before
that? we are unfortunately given long mundane and dull scenes leading
up to their affection. As it comes to an end, we are given a great
climax which redeems the movie's faults and shows how love between
these two cannot be brokenOverall the film feels 'half-balked', great cast, great execution, poor
pace, it doesn't give us that emotional hit to care for them

Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel 'The Price of Salt', Carol centers
on the story of two women falling in love in early 1950s New York. The
title character (Cate Blanchett) is a well-off wife and mother residing
in New Jersey. In the search for the present for her daughter, this
absolutely gorgeous blondish woman dressed up in a fabulous fur coat,
is waited on by Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a young clerk at a
department store. With Carol's daughter's chosen doll being out of
stock, she ends up buying the train set for a Christmas gift. The two
remain in contact because of the gloves that Carol (who knows if not
deliberately) leaves behind.Unlike in the book, we don't see Carol only through Therese's eyes.
Thanks to the beautifully introduced perspective shifts, the
subjectivity arousing from the point of view is lessened. There are
three worlds around us. First of all, there is Therese's world where
she has a nice but definitely more emotionally invested in this
relationship boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy) who keeps insisting on
taking her to Europe. She is surrounded by a group of friends and
aspires to become a photographer. Then, there is Carol's world that
reveals her relationships with her daughter Rindy, husband Harge (Kyle
Chandler), friend as well as former lover Abby (Sarah Paulson) and
Harge's family. This leads us to the story raising another important
issue when Carol has to choose, owing to the perception of
homosexuality and the sexism of this period, between having custody of
a child and being with the loved one.The third world is the one that Carol and Therese share with each
other. It begins with the meeting in the department store and results
in a first lunch date, a visit in Carol's house and eventually
departing on the road trip West. It's the world with waves of emotion
sweeping over the two characters, the world that evokes our memories of
falling in love or the world that makes us wonder what it feels like to
be in love for the first time.Each world is filled up with a stunning grasp of color and light, a
marvelous capturing of characters' profiles through the glass (Ed
Lachman), a mesmerizing and touching soundtrack (Carter Burwell) as
well as distinctive but reflecting the reality of that time outfits
(Sandy Powell).Carol is not just a beautiful film with amazing performances, well-
written screenplay, noteworthy direction, cinematography and costumes.
It is also a project that required a great deal of investment among the
people involved in it. It's hard to resist Cate Blanchett's words that
the commitment to make this film see its daylight and the actual
filming process constituted a real labor of love.

'CAROL': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed romantic drama flick; about a shopgirl, and
aspiring photographer, that develops a relationship with an older woman
(in 1950s New York). The movie is based on the popular 1952 novel 'The
Price of Salt', by Patricia Highsmith. It was directed by Todd Haynes,
and scripted by Phyllis Nagy. The film stars Cate Blanchett and Rooney
Mara; both were nominated for Oscars, for their performances (Nagy was
also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay). Like most Oscar bait; the
movie is extremely slow-paced, but very well made. The story begins in 1952 Manhattan; where Therese Belivet (Mara) works
as a clerk, at Frankenberg's. Therese really wants to be a
photographer, but her boyfriend, Richard (Jake Lacy), wants her to go
to France with him; as well as marry him. Therese is unsure of their
relationship. Everything changes when she meets a beautiful older
woman, named Carol (Blanchett), at the department store where she
works. The two engage in a passionate romance; much to the
disappointment of Carol's husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler). Carol and
Harge are going through a bitter divorce; which is very hard on their
young daughter. It is nice to see a romance (set in 1950s New York) involving two
beautiful woman. I'm sure the book was extremely controversial; and
ahead of it's time. I admire the movie for being different, and it is
very well made. Both Blanchett and Mara are great in their roles; and
the supporting cast is all good as well. I just wish so many of these
movies didn't have to be so boring!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:

Would love to see the movie but it isn't playing any closer than 30
MILES from where I live in the east bay of Northern California. Not all
seniors drive such a distance when they have SEVERAL theaters locally.How sad I cannot comment on the movie itself. There must be something
ultra special about it that it isn't shown in Pleasanton, Livermore,
Danville or Walnut Creek, California.Then again? When you don't make it easy for people to view, why
bother?!OK. Hm. I haven't written enough? Expressed my disappointment enough?

Cate Blanchett is pretty much brilliant in every way. She can pull off
any character, in any year, for any film. Rooney Mara is nearing that
territory as well. Even in a pretty crappy film, Pan, from earlier this
year, Mara is still captivating through a rough script. They are simply
two of the best actresses working today, and probably locks to get
nominated for Oscars this year as well. Carol isn't anywhere near the
best film of the year, but it may have two of the best performances.Blanchett plays Carol, a married mother of a little girl who's in the
midst of a divorce and custody issues with her daughter, all because
she lives in a time period where having an unwarranted relationship
with another person of the same sex is viewed as unnatural. She meets
Therese, a department store clerk, and the two engage in a relationship
which starts out innocent and turns into something romantic. What I
really liked about this film was that everything feels very organic and
natural. Nothing with their relationship or even the two woman's other
relationships with men feel forced. Carol and her husband go through
very real arguments, especially for that time period, and Therese is
clearly going through an identity crisis, so the film flows very well
as they go through their ups and downsIt's a slow watch and the script is good but it also doesn't contain
that one particular scene that Oscar voters usually cling towards. But
the performances really drive the script towards possible awards level
status. The score done by Carter Burwell helped set the mood of every
scene and the cinematography by Edward Lachmann is also absolutely
gorgeous and does a great job at setting the 1950's New York scene
extremely well. The decision to use Super 16mm film was also a nice
touch to give it more of a classy and natural vibe. Aside from its slow pace, there's really nothing wrong with Carol. You
go to see these two wonderful actresses perform and they delivered in
every way. I don't know if they or the film will win come Oscar season,
but both deserve a look.+Undeniable chemistry between leads+Natural relationship+Score+Cinematography-Slow moving7.8/10

First my opinion of the movie without the lesbian theme.Great cinematography. The reconstitution of the 50's was perfect.
Splendid work.The adaptation of the novel however was terrible. As another reviewer
very aptly said, the novel lines that are in the mind of the director
are rendered through long pauses and stares. You are supposed too guess
the lines when that happens.The directing makes it worse. Both lead actresses seem to play in
different movies, answer to different people, react to different
situations. You don't understand how the passion evolves from the movie
only. The stages and pace of the relationship are not explained.Now the lesbian theme.I am surprised that it was unconditionally applauded by most LGBT
reviewers. In fact it could be understood as as much homophobic as
liberal. It revives the myth of the lesbian as a predator. Carol is a
mature lady who seduces an inexperienced girl. Carol is a wealthy lady
who seduces a poor employee. Also the acting by Cate Blanchett is
explicitly predator- ish, and the acting by Rooney Mara explicitly
victim-ish.The exposition of the judicial trouble facing lesbians at the time is
ambiguous as well. The husband and the lawyer are presented as very
moderate. In fact you could almost root for them, in the context of the
time. Carol is not placed in an insane asylum, she will keep her wealth and
have the good life. She does not really lose her daughter either, the
daughter is not placed in an orphanage. And Carol will be able to see
her all the time when the daughter is of age. Plus Carol is not shown
as very determined to keep her daughter eventually.The whole results in a dull and morally too cautious movie. No sides
are taken, no passion is really dealt with. Very ambiguous.

Todd Haynes has made some solid films (Velvet Goldmine, Far From
Heaven, I'm Not There, etc) and he manages to move his cast of
characters in this sensitive film based on Patricia Highsmith's 2004
novel 'The Price of Salt' to equal the impact and timing of Highsmith's
concept in her novel. Phyllis Nagy adapted the novel for the screen.
According to Highsmith's story, Therese (Rooney Mara)is nineteen and
working in a department store during the Christmas shopping season. She
dates men, although not with real enthusiasm. One day a beautiful older
woman comes over to her counter and buys a doll. As the purchase is a
C.O.D. order, Therese makes a mental note of the customer's address.
She is intrigued and drawn to the woman. Although young, inexperienced
and shy, she writes a note to the customer, Carol (Cate Blanchett), and
is elated and surprised when Carol invites her to meet. Therese
realizes she has strong feelings for Carol, but is unsure of what they
represent. Carol, in the process of a bitter separation and divorce, is
also quite lonely. Soon the two women begin spending a great deal of
time together. Before long, they are madly and hopelessly in love. The
path is not easy for them, however. Carol also has a child and a very
suspicious husband dangerous ground for the lovers. When the women
leave New York and travel west together, they discover the choices
they've made to be together will have lasting effects on both their
lives. Considered to be the first lesbian pulp novel to break the pulp
publishing industry- enforced pattern of tragic consequences for its
lesbian heroines, The Price of Salt was written under the pseudonym of
Claire Morgan by Patricia Highsmith  the author of 'Strangers on a
Train' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'. Both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant in this delicate
story. Sarah Paulson adds depth as Carol's previous lover Abby. The
flavor of the 1950s is superb as is the cinematography and musical
score. The only casting problem is with the men  blustering
insensitive performances especially by Kyle Chandler as Carol's
husband-on- the-way-out disrupt the flow of the film distractingly.
Otherwise it is a triumph for all concerned. Still highly recommended.

Todd Haynes only made 2 other feature films in the last 15 years. The
last one was I'M NOT THERE and before that (nearly 13 years ago) was
FAR FROM HEAVEN. CAROL is extremely reminiscent of FAR FROM HEAVEN. The
obvious similarity is the plot involving a person coming to terms with
their spouse's homosexual tendencies. However, there are other
similarities: the 1950s setting, the deliberately slow pace, the
stuffiness of East Coast society.I liked FAR FROM HEAVEN's atmosphere, much like classic Douglas Sirk
films. CAROL seems to be lacking that and, for that fact, I think FAR
FROM HEAVEN is the better film. All in all, CAROL is a suitable
companion piece to FAR FROM HEAVEN.

I have always admiring the performances by Ms Blanchett and Mara. And
after watched "Carol", it definitely affirms of how great they are and
how marvelous the film is."Carol" stands out of all the mainstream movies in 2015 that feeding us
through media. I was a little bit bored until "Carol" hit the theatres. The chemistry between Blanchett and Mara in the story that takes place
in the American 1950's era is mind-blowing. The photography is
mesmerizing. The music is gorgeous. And with such combinations, they
work together splendidly. They pull you in emotionally in such
soul-stirring ways.A small film with already over 100 nominations. There's nothing more to
prove how great this film is, how quality and superior it is. Ms
Blanchett, Mara, director Haynes and Phyllis Nagy gave the powerful
performance, love story, and film of 2015.

In the vote between convention and passion the eyes have it. Carol and
Therese both express profound yearning and strength in their looks at
each other. Therese in her innocence is wide-eyed, Carol powerful, drawn back and
appraising. That difference catches the predatory element in Carol's
love and Therese's various disadvantages in experience and power. In contrast to the two women's emotional looks, a slammed door window
frames husband Harge's angry, violent eye. He has isolated himself,
framed himself out of his wife's emotions and in refusing to let her go
imprisoned himself. Until Harge threatens to sue for sole custody of their daughter, Carol
is confident, wealthy, assured. She dresses elegantly, in expensive
style, asserting her blondness even in the fur she flaunts, against the
more conventional dark mink of the era. Young Therese dresses trimly,
in neat plaids and restrained colours and lines, except for the
flourish of her bold, ballooning tam, which anticipates her
unconventional sexuality. The assigned Santa hat is a brief
diminishment which wins her Carol's first encouragement. As in Far From Heaven Todd Haynes uses a 1950s setting, plot line, and
characterization to address a contemporary tension. Carol has the
perfect '50s heroine response to life: "Just when it can't get any
worse, you run out of cigarettes." But all the characters are frozen in
the '50s confusion between love and desire and all live under the
shadow of male-cantered sexuality. The period setting reminds us that we're still not entirely free from
considering same-sex love a moral issue. Gay lovers have an easier time
today but there remains a stubborn prejudice against following one's
heart "against the grain" of social convention.When Carol accedes to Harge's custody demand she admits two motives.
The primary is to give their daughter the best possible life, to
minimize her damage by her parents' conflict. But equally important,
she can't "go against the grain" of her own nature, neither as a mother
nor as a sexual being.That theme raises the film beyond "love story" and certainly beyond "a
lesbian love story." Love, after all, is a nebulous concept. Therese
can't get boyfriend Richard to explain what it is. It's what he says
makes her attraction to him different from the two women he's already
had sex with. (Did i mention that the film is set in the '50s?) Even when Carol tells Therese she loves her what do we know? Or they?
Not much beyond the attraction they immediately had for each other 
again, registered in their locked eyes across the enchanted department
store. As Carol's lifelong friend and ex-lover Abby notes, the passion
erupts and then "things change." The ardor once faded, what
relationship survives? Confirming the ephemerality of ardor, Therese
spots Richard dancing with his new girlfriend at the party.The film's main theme then is not lesbian love or even love in general
but the related question: how can we determine what we want. As Therese
admits, "I don't know what I want. How could I know what I want if I
say yes to everything?" Of course always saying No is as restrictive as always saying Yes. When
she recoils from the Times reporter, Therese says she doesn't mind his
premature kiss but clearly has to leave. From the yes she moves to her
first tentative 'no.' Two exceptions result from Carol's influence. The
first is when Therese doesn't wait to say Yes but takes the initiative
to advance their relationship from friends to lovers. The second is
when the "blossomed" Therese says no to Carol's invitation to move into
her new Manhattan flat. Otherwise Therese doesn't know what she wants
or needs and just goes with the drift. Finally Therese manages a yes and a no combined. When she declines
another lesbian's advance at the Village party she accepts her true
nature and leaves to say yes to Carol. This time when they lock
glances, Carol  at home amid her social and class peers  still finds
another level of satisfaction when she sees Therese has returned. But
it's the '50s. She can only smile back.Both need what the other provides, including a rare intimacy. On the
phone after their first break Therese says "I wanna ask you things, but
I'm I'm not sure that you want that." Carol, crying, says "Ask me
things Please." For all her experience and power, Carol needs to be
asked because she craves intimacy. She learns from Therese how to
determine what she wants by determining, issue by issue, when to say
yes and when no.

Indie. Art house film. Limited release. Select cities. Select theaters.
(Needle in a haystack). Those first five phrases are associated with
movies that many people won't get a chance to see in American movie
theaters. That last phrase (in parentheses) is my translation. While
movies that hit theaters in ways that can best be described in
restrictive terms don't have the mass appeal of films that immediately
(or quickly) appear in wide release, there are still plenty of people
who are anxious to see those limited releases. For a Movie Fan who
doesn't live in or near Los Angeles or New York City, it can be
frustrating to wait for (and sometimes never get) an opportunity to see
a highly anticipated film on the big screen.Take "Carol" (R, 1:58) for example. That film opened in limited release
on November 20, 2015  in four theaters  in L.A. and New York. A week
later, it expanded to a few other markets, but was still in less than
two dozen theaters nationwide. On December 25, "Carol" was showing in
the Top 50 U.S. markets (in about 150 theaters) and continued to expand
into January, but still topping out at fewer than 1,000 screens across
the country. Such is the case with many films which dare to tackle
extraordinary topics and use story-telling and cinematic techniques
that differ from your average Hollywood blockbuster. Nothing against
the average Hollywood blockbuster, but sometimes films that start in
limited release are equally eagerly anticipated by certain open-minded
Movie Fans and are often equally worth the wait.After 11 years in development (acutally, nearly two decades, if you
count from the first draft of the proposed script), "Carol" finally
brings Patricia Highsmith's semi-autobiographical 1952 novel "The Price
of Salt" to the big screen. The book, from the author of "The Talented
Mr. Ripley", was adapted by Highsmith's friend Phyliss Nagy. In spite
of the long wait that many Highsmith fans have endured (and the fact
that this film was only released a year after its completion in order
for it to debut on the festival circuit), its timing is impeccable. At
the end of a year in which the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage
equality the law of the land and which saw the release of such timely
films as "Freeheld", "Do I Sound Gay?", "The D Train", "Grandma",
"Stonewall" and "The Danish Girl", "Carol" represents a wonderful and
creative final act to a big year for the LGBT community and those who
care about equal rights for all."Carol" is a love story set in the early 1950s. Oscar winner Cate
Blanchett stars as the title character, a wealthy woman living outside
New York with her husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler), and their young
daughter, Rindy (twins KK and Sadie Heim). When she is in the city to
buy a Christmas gift for Rindy, Carol meets Therese (Rooney Mara), a
young woman working the counter for the holidays (even though what she
really wants to do is become a photographer). Therese has a boyfriend
named Richard (Jake Lacy) who loves and wants to marry her, but Therese
is hesitating. When Therese finds a pair of gloves that Carol left
behind at the store, Therese gets Carol's address off of the sales
receipt and mails them to her. (No, this wasn't Radio Shack. It's the
50s, when many stores recorded their customers' addresses.) Carol calls
the store and offers to thank Therese for her kindness by taking her to
dinner. Although there is a significant age difference between the
women (not to mention a big difference in social standing), there is an
undeniable attraction between them. They are both very slow to act on
their feelings for each other, preferring instead to simply spend time
together, first at Carol's house for the holidays, then at Therese's
apartment looking at her photography, and later, on a spontaneous
cross-country road trip.But nothing will come easily for Carol and Therese. Carol's marriage
has been poisoned by her secret attraction to other women, which
included a youthful tryst with Carol's childhood friend, Abby (Sarah
Paulson), with whom Carol remains friends. Those old wounds are
reopened for Harge when Therese shows up in his home. Carol and Harge
were already in the process of divorcing, but Therese's presence in
Carol's life greatly complicates that situation. Their love is
developing at a time and place when same-sex romantic relationships
were widely considered immoral  including within the nation's court
system."Carol" is a beautiful motion picture in every sense of the word. For
Movie Fans ready to accept it, the love story between the two main
characters is tender and heartfelt. Although the film clearly shows the
difficulties inherent in a lesbian love affair in the early 50s, the
social and legal ramifications never take over the story, which remains
focused on the relationship between these two women. Their romance
plays out as influenced more by who they are as people and what is
happening in their lives than by external factors. It makes for a very
effective film.Enhancing the sense of time and place, previous Oscar nominee, director
Todd Haynes, ensures impeccable set design and costume work, then has
his cinematographer use a technique which makes the film appear
somewhat grainy, giving it a definite 1950s' feel. (Some may find this
off-putting, but you get used to it and it really adds to the film's
effectiveness.) Last but certainly not least, Blanchett and Mara each
do some of the best work of their careers. "Carol" started out as a
"limited release" and can be called an "art house film", but I just
call it great storytelling, and definitely worth waiting for. "A-"

This movie is completely amazing! First thing of all, during the whole
story we have the Christmas cozy mood: snow, coats, cigarettes, hot
drinks, and well, a hot story. The most interesting thing about this
film, is that you can feel two opposite things at the same time: you
can feel the calm pace of the unwind, and how things are built, slowly
and softly; but in the meantime you can feel Carol's and Therese's
hearts craving for each other since the very first glance. Cate
Blanchett is absolutely stunning acting as Carol Aird, an enigmatic and
gorgeous mature woman; on the other hands, Rooney Mara is Therese,
which is a cute and bashful young woman. When these two hearts collide,
well, then the movie start to feel like a part of you, and you begin to
love every scene of it. Intense, beautiful and inspiring, this movie is
about a love story between two women who have feelings for each other;
dearly feelings, that show us that there's no wrong way to love.

'Carol', for its performances alone, is worth a watch. Having said
that, the film is strictly okay, despite some powerful, ground-breaking
moments. The pace wobbles & the Writing is erratic. This Award
Juggernaut is actually a mixed bag!'Carol' Synopsis: In 1950s New York, a department-store clerk who
dreams of a better life falls for an older, married woman.'Carol' has two Aces -- Cate Blanchett & Rooney Mara. Words fail to
describe their commitment. Blanchett is unparalleled, yet again. She
adds extraordinary depth to Carol, resulting into a protagonist driven
by grief. Mara does a Tour-De-Force. She catches you unaware & then
leaves you spell-bound. 'Carol', if anything, is a showcase for great
Acting. But now, the hiccups. 'Carol' is unevenly paced. The narrative is
wobbly, inconsistent. Of course, some sequences, particular in the
second-hour, are powerful, but overall, its far from enriching. Phyllis
Nagy's Screenplay, based on the novel The Price of Salt (also known as
Carol) by Patricia Highsmith, is okay. There was so much potential, but
the Writer does not make much use of it. Todd Haynes's Direction is
dignified & Edward Lachman's Photography is terrific. Carter Burwell's
Score is wonderful, as well.On the whole, 'Carol' has some of the finest performances you'll seen
this year, but its not a great film. Nonetheless, go for the acting.

...(maybe frankly) I've seen the french film 'La vie d'Adèle' (2013)
directed by Abdellatif Kechiche. This movie had too many similarities
and it just hurt me to know it caught the attention of many. Don't get
me wrong, it's a good movie. The film's narration flow, the characters'
chemistry, Cate Blanchett's sublime performance (Oscar nomination
totally well deserved), the 50s vibes, the costume designs (which I
believe it's worthy of the Academy's prize), and the list could keep
going. So trust me, if I knew this was a truly innovative film, I'd
give it a 10. 7.5 rating on IMDb, 95 Metascore, 93% in RT. I'd
challenge to watch La vie d'Adèle to all the raters and critics of
Carol and I would expect this movie's hype to drop drastically. I mean,
I'm not here to promote the french film or to drag this movie down, but
to truly give each film what it deserves. I appreciate both movies
supporting gay marriage and all. But let me give you a list of
resemblances. 1) The lesbian couple 2) The plot: both movies' couples
get challenged that jeopardize their relationship (although Carol's, in
my opinion, was too pretentious) 3) Carol's opening (and ending) scene:
too similar to the coffee shop scene from La vie d'Adèle 4) Character's
personalities: Emma and Carol as the dominant and prideful type, and
Adèle and Therese as the submissive, shy, insecure, identity seeker
person. 5) One specific shot where the camera shows the 'submissive
characters' walking away on the street from La vie d'Adèle's last
scene. 6) The ending: where they don't work out and miss each other,
and see each other for the last time.I'm pretty sure people won't agree with this unless they've not seen
both movies, and I obviously expect some hate, after seeing the ratings
of this movie, but one thing I'm 100% positive about is this movie
being an influence of the french masterpiece. I believe La vie d'Adèle
deserves the attention Carol has been getting and that is why I gave it
a 4.

Todd Haynes outdid himself with this splendid movie. Everything in this
movie is truly beautiful. What captures the eye at first sight is the
spectacular cinematography, the era of the 50's is shown impeccably
well in this film. The music draws your attention and keeps you focused
and has the perfect amount of emotionality for the scenes it builds a
foundation for. The makeup and hair department deserve just as much
praise, as they did a magnificent job as well. But the most beautiful aspect of this movie is the acting. I never paid
much attention to the acting of Kyle Chandler, but he does an extremely
good job in this movie. If the category for best male actor in a
supporting role wasn't as swamped as it is, he might have had a chance.
He captured me with his emotional expressions. Sarah Paulson and Jake
Lacy live up to their parts as well. The best part of the ensemble for
this movie are the two lead women. I absolutely loved the chemistry
between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, I have seen nothing of the kind
between two actresses in any movie. They both deliver incredible,
moving and exceptional performances and I am filled with joy that they
are both nominated for the Academy Awards for their portrayals of these
strong characters, be it controversial categories. This movie is a must see if you want a strong, moving and different
love story.

Carol is a story of two people, they happen to be women but they could
be anybody, who find each other and find a connection and love. It's
the circumstances and timing that makes the conflicts more than
anything, the external forces around Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese
(Rooney Mara) that makes it very difficult to be together; it's the
early 1950's and even though it's the North-East (seemingly liberal
terrain) it's the world of upper-middle class whiteness where things
are simple and plain and heterosexual (on the surface). The core of the
movie are these two women, and director Todd Haynes has two of the
magnificent actors working, man or woman, working today with Blanchett
and (a strikingly beautiful/adorable) Mara, and it's a pleasure to see
them with full-blown chemistry.The other question is if it's a great film, or at least one of the best
of the year? Well, first of all, it is worth seeing, I'll say that for
sure. What it accomplishes that surprised me is that it's not a simple
Lesbian-message-love-story screed. We've had plenty of those, albeit
not one maybe with some more mainstream appeal outside of the art-house
world like this may and should. But I think that the interest in the
more intellectual sense is that it's simply a movie about a system that
keeps (or kept, maybe it still does) women without power. Case in
point, Carol and her ex-husband Harge (Kyle Chandler, kind of the same
as Dennis Quaid in Far From Heaven in the sense of uptight
masculinity), who can't seem to agree on a custody agreement with their
young daughter. Carol may lose her daughter forever because... well,
she is in love with another woman? She probably would've lost custody
if it was just another man. It seems like a suffocating system in this
film.And yet what I think works in terms of the content of the story of
showing the trouble of this intimacy being possible - and there is
intimacy here, but in a grown-up, compelling way - may not work 100%
with the style. This is not to say it's not beautifully photographed;
this is different work we normally don't get to see in movies with such
big names, and Ed Lachmann makes it seem desaturated but pretty, like a
color photograph that's faded over time (and on Super 16mm no less,
kind of the same but lo-fi reverse of what Tarantino did this year in
70mm). But I felt like Haynes' direction made what was at times
fascinating cinematography to also make a distance with the characters.This may be useful to illustrate a point, about this environment. I
found ultimately it took away for me what was the potential to connect
with the characters. At the point I should've at least had a lump in my
throat, let alone tears, when Carol and Therese have their trials and
tribulations, I didn't really feel anything - nor with the ending,
which I'll get to in a moment. This may be a fault on my part, and if
you feel something deep and powerful here, that's more than fine, I may
just be missing something. But I think it felt a little too deliberate
at times, everything looks SO perfect here with the costumes and sets
and place and time, and it becomes... staid, a little poised, even with
the actors.It may sound like I don't like the movie, but I did, at times very much
so. There wasn't any one thing through most of the run time that took
me out of the movie. I was with the journey of these women (also an
interesting supporting role for Sara Paulsen, who has the kind of
character detail I really appreciate to see in a story like this), and
their rise and fall in such a short period of time is never less than
fascinating, and Blanchett and Mara do very well in their realizations
of these people as fully 3-dimensional humans. The only ones who sort
of suffer character-wise are the men, even for Kyle Chandler who is
giving it his all; they were slightly one-dimensional, basically there
to set up bullet points or obstacles for the characters. This may also
be something I missed on a first viewing, but I think this may be
deliberate too: it's very much a feminist film, and that's a wonderful
thing, except that it should be something where all the characters have
depth, not just the women.One last point I'd like to make is the ending. It's one of those times
I'm uncertain how to feel about it; I won't spoil it, though it's more
of an emotional point than anything like plot-wise. But there is a
point where it should have ended (you see it near the beginning
actually) and it would have added a level of mature-tragic dimension,
not unlike the ending of Manhattan or something (seeing how one
character grows apart from the other, but in a way that makes sense).
It's ultimately a kind of happy ending, and yet I'm unsure that was the
note to end on - this is 50's melodrama, and for 90% of the time it's
successful by updating itself. Let me put it this way: it's a waste of
Carrie Brownstein.

From the start, I was struck by the skill, accuracy, and attention to
detail in which the period setting of the early 1950s was evoked,
conspicuously lacking in those jarring anomalies which so many
productions set in past eras are prone. The costumes, and what used to
be referred to as the art direction, are immaculate.There's the pitch-perfect performances of Cate Blanchett and Rooney
Mara, the latter whom I'd not seen before, both impeccably cast and
utterly believable. This is not a film that relies on frequent twists
and turns of the plot, but on the developing emotional relationship
between the two characters, which I found thoroughly gripping, and at
times, very moving. In the first half, Blanchett's Carol is a somewhat
enigmatic figure, seen mainly through the eyes of Mara's Therese, while
later she is treated much more objectively. I thought Abby, Carol's
childhood friend, and then lover, played by Sarah Paulson, bore a
resemblance to the original author, Patricia Highsmith; I wonder if
this was intentional? I think everyone involved in the making of this can feel justifiably
proud.

A film that is not easy for anyone to watch it. Todd Haynes has
directed "Carol" from a screenplay by Phyllis Nagy, with superb
precision. It's a drama, a homosexual love story, with two great
performances from Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, who never disappoint
me. She is always so fragile and powerful. Moreover, it's a bittersweet
film, sometimes a little bit boring, that it captures the era
perfectly. I don't believe that is the movie of the year, as many
people say, because personally, I didn't found myself emotionally
engaged to all this. Overall, it is an extremely slow film but
watchable.

Today we are flooded with content, especially an endless stream of
movies. We consume films differently than we used to. A trip to the
cinema is a rare occurrence. However, we still remember films from
another time. We may or may not have seen them, but we would at least
know what they are. At least someone would have told us at one point or
another that it is a masterpiece. It becomes one when the talent, the
means and the circumstances involved in the production all fall into
place. There are no shortcomings. The acting, the writing, the
directing, the production values, musiceverything works in concert to
achieve a perfect balance. It's a rarity to see this achieved today. We
can easily pick up on the shortcomings of most movies. The storytelling
can be lazy. An over-reliance on CGI attempts to cover plot holes. The
acting is woodenBut Carol makes me want to revisit her as soon as the
credits have rolled, and I am about to see her for the fifth time.It is not just Blanchett and Mara who are luminous, sumptuously playing
off each other like partners engaged in committing the perfect crime.
The supporting players are excellent. Kyle Chandler welcomes sympathy
as Carol's husband Harge who, despite and air of selfishness and
concern for his own reputation, tries his utmost to keep his family
unit together. Sarah Paulson is unforgettable as Abby, Carol's
childhood friend and ex, who chooses to remain in Carol's orbit, to be
there as her best friend, at all times, be they joyful or devastating.
The rest of the cast, appearing in minor roles or as extras, many from
Cincinnati, shed artifice and appear as real people, blending perfectly
into the world of the film. Judy Becker's production design supplies
post-war austerity, livid colors and authentic detail while Sandy
Powell's costumes feel unique, stunning but also timely and lived-in.
Shot on Super 16mm and lensed by Ed Lachman, Carol pays homage to great
photography of the 50s. Shots through windows, condensation,
reflection, light- and shadow-play evoke the work of Saul Leiter.
Photographers like Ruth Orkin, Vivian Maier and Helen Levitt, among
others, were also major influences. Lachman and Haynes also referenced
Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, L'Eclisse and La Notte for their
use of abstract and spatial relationships to enter their characters'
minds. George Stevens' A Place in the Sun and David Lean's A Brief
Encounter informed the point of view of the most vulnerable lover. Even
Carol's editor Affonso Gonçalves shows restraint, lingering on
silences, stoking our desire to witness a declaration of love between
the heroines, just as Carter Burwell's sublime score swirls around
them. It is as if Carol is a revelatory time capsule, drawing us deeper
into her mystery and secrets, where a simple act of love comes at a
staggering cost.Abandon everything. Right now. See if Carol is playing anywhere near
you. See her by yourself, with friends, your family or someone special.
Go, watch one of the most beautiful and arresting love stories ever
committed to film.This is an edited version of my review which was published on

When I saw this movie I knew it's considered one of the best of 2015,
and among the favorites for many prestigious awards. The story seemed
interesting, and so it was, but the film itself was rather boring.Inspired by a 1950's novel by Patricia Highsmith, Carol portrays an
eccentric lesbian love story between two much different women. One of
them is the titular character, an elegant woman in her forties whom the
experienced and brilliant Cate Blanchett portrays beautifully,
especially her sentiments and passions. The other is Therese, a weak
and introvert young woman portrayed by Rooney Mara. The two stars of
the film play their parts fine, both individually and combined as there
seems to be good chemistry between them. However, I strongly believe that the analysis of the characters, both
the two women and the others, is not as deep and touching as it could -
and should- have been, and the inevitable result is that the viewer
fails to identify themselves with anyone. You just sit and watch their
adventures and misfortunes, but, other than a mere sympathy, you can't
feel much about them, or even for them. Furthermore, both the
relationship between the two main characters and their relationships
with other people (Carol's family, Therese's boyfriend and few friends)
are left unexpanded and unclear.I know that the LGBT subject of the story is very subtle, and it was
even more when Highsmith wrote the novel, and it's natural for a film
depicting such a story to attract attention. If you have read other
novels written by the same author (or watched the film adaptations),
such as "Strangers on a Train" or "The Talented Mr. Ripley", it's
nothing of the kind. And that's another fault of the film; while
Highsmith's novels are based in suspense, this one fails to attract
your interest and make you anxiously wait to see what happens.In the end the result is a decent but mediocre film. Blanchett and
Mara, especially the former, do their best but the screenplay is
somewhat weak and unable to keep the viewer's attraction. If you can
identify yourself with the characters and see "between the lines", if
there's anything important there, you'll probably like it. Otherwise,
there's not much too see. 6/10

It's a great romance, it's like watching a book story. The language of
the signs, of the glances, of the sentences. A simple "Your perfume
smells good" can means " I want you", and the way to look each other
can shows a lot meaning behind that. We are on the 1952 and this is
story of a lesbian love. Where one person can change the life of the
another one, and together can change the life of other people. But to
do that, you need to suffer before and this is what can let this love
grow. Desire, absence, imagination, eroticism, art. Any details of each
shot, can show a new meaning, a new detail that can let you understand
a lot go them. It's a love movie. The Carol's love for her daughter,
for the sense of life when she is available to decline all the support
of her lawyer, because what is really important are love and respect;
for the love for the freedom. What two people built together, means
more than revenge and malice. And what they built always will remain,
and we have to take care of that, because it's the most beautiful part
of us. That's what is important. The gay love in an America not ready
for that, but so intense to make think about that. The movie is just a
bit slow, but it's even the time of loveit requires time to grow, to
be experienced and to be part of each other. And this slow rhythm makes
you appreciate each beautiful details of this story.

As the awards season wrapped up it's 2016 run, I was left feeling The
Academy missed out on something miraculous, but audience members sure
didn't, even though it's a movie we don't quite deserve. Carol is
simply miraculous. The grace and restraint weaved into the screenplay
is simply the result of a master at work. Of the several times I've
seen 'Carol', the last sequence never fails to put a smile on my face.
It's such a personable moment that fills the viewer with so much hope.
As a gay man, sometimes I feel as if I'm stuck on a merry-go-round;
stuck in a loop of chasing after someone that doesn't reciprocate my
feelings, or is discouraged by society's disapproval. That's life.
People leave us. We suffer under loneliness sometimes, but 'Carol' has
reminded me that my love is not doomed to tragedy as it's been reduced
to in movies prior to the game-changing 'Carol'. Brokeback Mountain
comes to mind. Thank you Todd Haynes-and-team for sticking with 'Carol'
to portray a story that paints the love between two women as something
unassumingly simple and beautiful, without tragedy. I have hope to find
someone who will look at me and smile just as Highsmith's characters
do, each other. Carol is a must-see. Not only is it a heart-warming
romance, but a window into an ignorant 1950's world that barrels into
the private lives of these women and tries to snatch away their freedom
to pursue happiness separate from the ideals of society.

Carol is a movie that everyone talks about, mostly because it's a love
story between two women. But, what makes it a great movie to me is that
it depicts a love at first sight story and the main actors happen to be
two women. It focuses on the connection between the two persons, but
not the gender of the characters. This is the reason why it moved me.
The storyline is simple: one person meets another person, fall in love
and how to handle all the problems arise because of this relationship.
But what is stunning in this movie is the acting of the two main
actresses. Their actings make the story touching and worth watching.
You could feel the love between Carol and Therese from the way they
look at each other and the way they interact. Definitely worth watching.

Carol isn't just a self-exploration sojourn of Therese Belivet; it is
so much more. With an enchanting screenplay to keep us company, Carol
walks with a constant finesse depicting human emotions in a beautiful
way. You can't help but feel for the characters as they carry the right
gusto in their acts.Rooney Mara is simply outstanding. She carries a face of innocence that
reads confusion quite often, whilst trying to learn the ways of her
character. Coming to her aid is the voluptuous Carol Aird played by
Cate Blanchett, whose life is torn apart owing to an ongoing divorce
scene that hurls her into fits of melancholia.SPOILERS: The way Todd Haynes traverses the camera from a gutter to a
third person perspective by capturing the rattling and chugging of a
train in the backdrop, to reach the protagonists having a conversation
on a table speaks volume of his sheer genius. Right there the prologue
gets painted, and memories gush in from the past through the mist of
the car window, as Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) gawks at the city,
being indifferent to the talks of the mundane.It is a beautiful way of depicting movie frames which Haynes seems to
have mastered. He nails them like a pro. Complements Todd brilliantly
in the background with an enthralling profound score is Carter Burwell,
whose music is placed at right scenes, to make you feel the flick's
endearing rhythm."My angel, flung out of space." Love has so many forms. It goes beyond
age and sex, and Patricia Highsmith's story couldn't cover it better.
With a genius like Todd to help us crawl alongside the frames, the
movie forever stays in empathetic waters. With spectacular performances
by Cate and Rooney, the movie reaches a pinnacle of emotions. Little
things, like when Therese notices minute details in Carol whilst she
drives, and when she shows up eventually with a quivering heart hoping
that she would see her are all brilliantly shot.The movie's drama at times misses on milking Carol's love for Therese.
Her life's atrocities fail to cash in on the love she feels for
Therese, and that's where the flick appears to have dwindled. But still
Haynes manages to keep the juices flowing and what we have in the end
is a magnificent project in melodrama.Highly recommended!

As a gay man, I don't think in my 24 years of being on this earth I
have ever been more moved than I was watching "Carol". After it was
over I just sat there, thinking "My God, they did it. They portrayed us
as normal people who know how to love and finally we get a story where
no one dies or is left heartbroken because that's the kind of love we
deserve."I didn't actually think all that in one sitting, all of that came later
when I had more time to think. The beauty of the movie lies in every
part of it: the outfits, the camera-work, the acting, the two actresses
they chose for this forbidden love. It all falls together perfectly
like a puzzle all of those LGBT filmmakers have been trying to go at
for years. I'm not saying those other movies are bad, each of them in
their own ways are good and respectable. But in the end they all dealt
with it in that same old way, the way of the past. Make it known that
these two don't belong together, show the bigotry and the death, one or
the other.While "Carol" has moments where it almost slips into one of those
clichés, it quickly realizes it and pulls out. That's what makes it
great. It's not an agenda film, it's a film about love in its purest
form.That's why I think I enjoyed it much more than I did watching
"Brokeback Mountain". Although BM is a classic in its own right because
it was the first major film of its kind, to me "Carol" trumps it
because it's easier on the eyes, and it has a bigger heart.In my view, "Carol" will become a classic of Queer Cinema and cinema in
general, if it isn't already one.

CarolThe toughest part of being in a same-sex relationship is deciding who
has to sleep on the couch after an argument.Fortunately, the Sapphic socialite in this drama is likely to have a
really comfy one.Manhattan shop girl Therese (Rooney Mara) becomes smitten with a
sophisticated older woman, Carol (Cate Blanchett), who invites her to
spend the holidays with her.But Carol's ex-husband (Kyle Chandler) and Therese's boyfriend (Jake
Lacy) are adamant against their forbidden affair.So much so, that now the court is threatening to take Carol's daughter
from her because of her alternative lifestyle.An unexpectedly optimistic lesbian love story set in the ridged 1950s,
this handsomely shot art- house adaptation of the gay-lit novel from
the same era honors its iconic backdrop with sets and costumes as
alluring and nuanced as its May-December leads. Thankfully, nowadays, society would only have a problem with the
lesbians' noticeable age difference. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

Carol is one of the best of the year. It is sad, beautiful, and just
wonderful. Carol had great acting and a beautiful score. It was better
than i thought. i thought it would be a boring, dramatic movie that i
would absolutely hate, but it ended up being really good. Carol tells
the story of Therese (Rooney Mara), a woman who works in a toy store.
She sells a woman named Carol (Cate Blanchett) a train set for Carol's
daughter. They then become friends. Carol wants a divorce from her
husband but she is afraid her husband will get custody of her daughter.
Carol and Therese go on a road trip and end up falling in love. Carol's
husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler), hired a man to spy on them and the man
who spied in them made tapes of their conversations and he sent them to
Carol's husband. Therese feels terrible. The next morning, Carol is
gone with only letter left. It explains to Therese that Carol loves her
but she has to leave for her daughters sake. The ending makes you happy
because they finally meet again. It is a great movie. It is definitely
worth the watch.

The first thing I noticed was after seeing the movie is there's some
kind of mistake in the Oscars nominee. Rooney Mara should have been on
the lead role list, while Cate Blanchett in the supporting character's.
Maybe the Academy people misunderstood that the title role must be the
lead character. Theirs switched place actually does not make any sense.
Anyway the Oscars never made sense at all.This story was okay, but adapted screenplay and direction, especially
the music was excellent. For the ending scene alone, you will be
tempted to raise your rating than what you initially thought it
deserves. I was not expecting the movie to be awesome, so I'm not upset
for the overall movie.Believe me, the last thing I want in this movie is to see Cate
Blanchett in naked. Maybe out of respect or her age or she's not
attracted to me, there are plenty of reasons that I can't figure it out
which one, but after knowing what this theme is, I was only praying for
that not to happen. And obviously that is unavoidable, otherwise the
movie will lose its soul and strength.Well, it was better than I thought, both the actresses were good, but
Rooney Mara dominated. Whatever category she's in for the Oscars, I'll
be happy if she wins. It is not a must watch, but a decent movie and
betters in some parts.7/10

Carol is a romantic period drama set in the 1950s, adapted from
Patricia Highsmith's novel The Price of Salt, a 1952 novel. The movie
stars Cate Blanchett as Carol Aird, an upper class woman going through
a divorce, who falls in love with Therese Belivet(played by Rooney
Mara), a shop girl and aspiring photographer.Right from the get go, Carol has a definitive style and tone that is
maintained throughout the film, one that is integral to both the story
and the manner in which director Todd Haynes chooses to narrate it. The
establishing scene where Carol and Therese meet for the first time, is
one of the best examples of this, as complicated emotions of
attraction, intrigue, and charisma are conveyed merely through glances
and camera movement. This subtlety as both characters begin to
understand and deal with their emotions and feelings for each other are
key to the whole movie, and are continually accentuated by the
cinematography and the set choices. 1950s Manhattan comes to life with
a rather warm color palette, that would be familiar to anyone who's
seen movies set in the 50s/60s. However, it does add on to the story by
maintaining the subdued tone. The costumes are almost always
breathtaking, Carol's fur coats accentuating her grace and class while
Therese's dresses reflecting her youthful charm. Both the leads deliver
commendable performances, which is the film's selling point, and again,
something that Haynes seems to be aware of. This is obvious in the shot
choices  where you see almost every scene that features a rendezvous
between the two characters framed close to the actors, switching
between them as they deliver their lines, focusing on their delivery
and poise, which is supposed to speak and mean more than the words they
are saying. For a majority of the film, this is also true of the
interactions that Carol and Therese have with the other characters in
the film, be it Carol's with her soon to be ex- husband Harge (played
by Kyle Chandler) or Therese's with the men in her life. This works
also because in all of these relationships, including the one between
the two central characters, a sense of apprehension and hesitancy is
visible at the surface, in some cases governing it completely. This is
to be expected in a story which revolves around a relationship that is
'forbidden' in the eyes of the conservative time period. That, however,
is not the only element of restraint that is key, as also important is
the nature of these characters themselves, as they, especially Therese,
come to terms with being in love with each other. While their
relationship does blossom and eventually leads to physical intimacy ,
it is not until well into the movie and has little melodrama associated
with it, unlike the usual narrative in films about challenging social
opinion.While the characters do face challenges one would imagine arising out
of an 'unorthodox' relationship, these are not the driving forces of
the movie, but subplots that add to what is ultimately a film about the
complex emotions associated with love.The plot wades through somewhat familiar territory, and doesn't seem to
be the key element at work, but not something that would bother one
much, mainly because the performances and chemistry between the leads
is impeccable. The film also boasts a solid supporting cast, with Sarah
Paulson featuring as Carol's friend Abby. However, the film does
struggle to incorporate characters beyond the two leads (and the
husband Harge) in a meaningful manner leading to a few scenes which
seem to be extraneous. That, however, is a minor flaw in what is a
quite strong technical movie, with (apart from the elements mentioned
earlier) , a really good score. Having not read the book, this is mere
speculation, but it seems likely that all of these choices that are
intended to (and rather successfully) reflect a sense of subtlety are
because emotions and conflicts are what govern the book, and
translating that to film would be a difficult task without these tools.
It's not something that's very easy to do, but thanks to both the
performances and good direction, they do work.The film did create a decent amount of awards buzz, leading the pack
towards the start of the season but ultimately failing to garner either
a Best Picture or a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. It did
however garner 6 nominations : for the two acting categories,
cinematography, score, costume design, and adapted screenplay, winning
none. While I personally rejoiced in The Big Short's win for the
adapted screenplay category, having only seen Carol now after the
awards does make me feel more conflicted about it. While Carol doesn't
necessarily count as the best movie of the year for me (hopefully a
list I'll manage to create soon after getting to everything on the
watch-list), it's surely worth a watch. You'll like the film if
subtlety works for you, or if you cherish really strong acting, but you
might want to give it a skip if you tend to not like movies that aren't
fast paced or that don't involve a lot of strong quick dialogue.
Indeed, this film resorts to dialogue only when absolutely necessary.

Carol is a film based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith called, The
Price of Salt. In the 1950s, Carol Aird(Cate Blanchett) is a woman,
whose marriage is on the rocks. Though a lot has happened between Carol
& her husband, Harge Aird(Kyle Chandler), both of them love their
daughter, Rindy Aird(Sadie & Kk Heim) a lot. They ask for joint
custody. A young woman named Therese Belivet(Rooney Mara), who works in
a shop, finds herself unexpectedly drawn towards Carol, after Carol
buys something in her shop once. Carol & Therese soon discover, that
they have feelings for each other. This further complicates the issue
of Rindy's custody, between Carol & Harge. Carol is an amazing film! Director Todd Haynes has perfectly depicted
how love between two people of the same sex, would have been in the
1950s. The costumes by Sandy Powell are gorgeous. Edward Lachman's
cinematography, beautifully captures the essence of America in the
'50s. The chemistry between Cate Blanchett & Rooney Mara, is restrained
& electrifying at the same time. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Carol
Aird. The protagonist's various struggles throughout the film, have
been portrayed flawlessly by Blanchett. Rooney Mara is spectacular as
Therese Belivet. Mara's nuanced portrayal of Therese, is the standout
performance of the movie. Kyle Chandler is great as Harge Aird. Jake
Lacy is impressive as Richard Semco. Sarah Paulson is awesome as Abby
Gerhard. Cory Michael Smith is superb as Tommy Tucker. Sadie & Kk Heim
are adorable as Rindy Aird. The supporting cast is effective. If you
are not a fan of indie dramas, this movie is not for you. For everyone
else, Carol is a must watch!

You can tell that Carol was directed by a gay man. Its tasteful, with
even the love scenes devoid of the eroticism that some directors might
have resorted to. Haynes makes sure that every point of contact between
Therese and Carol is building their romance, almost like they're
falling in love through touch. Carol places her hands on Therese's
shoulders and we see Therese blush. There's a hand clutch as a sign of
comfort. They smell each other's perfume and linger in each other's
personal space just a little too long. You can feel their aching
loneliness expressed in their physical contact and as they passionately
embrace you can see them enveloping themselves in each other. Their
conversations flow just at the right pace for their romance - both
characters feel fully realised and neither seems unreasonable in their
dependence on the other. You can see Haynes' skill even in something as simple as the way Mara
and Blanchett hold their cigarettes - Mara holds hers nervously while
Blanchett holds it like a queen, and by the end of the film Mara has
more confidence and holds hers with a kind of unapologetic statement.
Sandy Powell's beautiful costumes are likely the best of the year,
especially Carol's beautiful big coat and Therese's colour bland colour
pallet with Santa hat. The deep red (Carol's signature colour) of
Therese' dress late in the film as Carol sees her from afar implies
that part of Carol has rubbed off on Therese. The cinematography
captures the first glance Therese has of Carol without resorting to the
cheap "people are there and then suddenly they're not" wipe cut of
every movie ever. Carter Burwell's gorgeously warm, soaring score
captures all of the romance, light and despondence of this film in its
strings and woodwind. It is reminiscent of early Harry Potter films.Blanchett and Mara's dual performances are utterly spectacular.
Blanchett's rich voice and powerfully classy exterior barely mask the
fragility underneath, of anger and bitterness and sadness and hurt. Her
vulnerability in the final conversation with Therese is palpable, and
the scene in the lawyer's negotiations is worthy of an Oscar nomination
in its own right. Rooney Mara owns the entire movie with her
spectacular work. You can see things that she wants to say written
clearly on her face. Her awkwardness around her boyfriend and open
chemistry with Carol are magnificent. You can see when she's shaken and
when she's finally able to smile with Carol of all people. Her tearful
monologue about "I always say yes" is the best scene in the film.Kyle Chandler is excellent as Harge, Carol's soon to be ex-husband.
There's an instant lack of positive energy with Blanchett, and the
disconnect in their conversations are clever. The jealousy bubbles on
the surface of his whole hunched body. For negatives, Carol is not as trim as it could be. Therese's boyfriend
exists as little more than a one-dimensional obstacle. Sarah Paulson's
character is undeveloped, especially apparent in a scene where Therese
asks why Abby hates her. I was so busy saying "where did that come
from?" that I barely comprehended that Abby was saying the same thing.
These are all things that could have been trimmed.But to finish on a positive, Carol opens with a beautifully directed
scene in which we follow a man named Jack into the building and he runs
into Therese. We can tell from the way Rooney Mara jolts and turns
around that we've interrupted something important. Later in the movie,
when we revisit this scene, I was completely awed by how accurate my
hunch was.

My husband and I attended CAROL at a local theater. In order to
appreciate the scenery, costumes, music score, great actors'
performances and understand the theme, see it In a theater. The
trailers are wonderful but seeing the movie gives them meaning; seeing
it multiple times is better yet to see what you missed the first time.We grew up in the 50's and many items reminded me of those times: i.e.
Carol's fur reminded me of my grandmother's; Shlitz beer was the beer
of choice in our home (my father was the beer distributor of Shlitz in
my hometown, and our family car resembled those used). My mother and
father honeymooned at the Drake hotel in Chicago. Oh, and Roony's cap
is the same plaid as a skirt I wore.We both enjoyed the movie thoroughly and hope to see it again and
again; my husband said the only thing missing was the gentlemen not
making room for Terese when she greeted Carol!

I think it's very important to remember the injustices committed
against individuals whose lifestyles didn't fit into the rigid "status
quo" from past times. On that aspect, Carol is an important and fully
justified film; however, judging it exclusively on the basis of its
intrinsic values, I found it competent, but not very memorable.
Inspired on the novel The Price of Salt by author Patricia Highsmith,
Carol works as a female counterpart of Far From Heaven, also directed
by Todd Haynes, which portrayed a domestic drama of adultery and sexual
repression into the deceptively perfect frame of middle class North
American suburbs during the '50s. Carol deals with a similar story set
during the same historical period, focused on two women who immediately
recognize their mutual attraction, even though they aren't sure on how
to proceed. Well, one of them isn't sure; the other one has experience
on those matters, and she recognizes the risk of scandal and dishonor
which could destroy her family. Even though the romance works as the
catalyst element of the story, I wouldn't consider Carol a romantic
film. I think that the aim of this movie was examining intolerance and
its consequences on an internal level, exploring the confusion from the
main characters, who don't only question their secret "perversion", but
also the devastating feelings of guilt inspired by the effects their
"weakness" has on the people around them. That's definitely a relevant
message, even in the less repressive current society; however, Phyllis
Nagy's screenplay occasionally hesitates, including some arbitrary
decisions which complicate an already difficult situation, which might
have worked better with less affectations and peripheral sub-plots
which don't lead to anything substantial. Even though I consider Cate
Blanchett an excellent actress, I found her performance in Carol a bit
cold and distant. On the opposite, Rooney Mara feels very natural and
sincere as a woman accustomed to repress her desires in order to follow
the "normal" path, until she realizes she will never find happiness
like that. On the male side, Kyle Chandler has the ungrateful role of
the rancorous husband; his performance is adequate, but the character
is too superficially written. Finally, Judy Becker's production design,
Edward Lachman's cinematography and Carter Burwell's score deserve
applause for taking us to the '50s with an appropriate detail and
subtleness. In conclusion, Carol has various positive elements, and the
message it brings is definitely important; however, it didn't leave me
completely satisfied, and I didn't like it as much as other lesbian
films (such as Kissing Jessica Stein and La Vie d'Adèle).

Carol has a lot of hype as one of the best movies of 2015. I will say
that it has some of the best performances of the year in Cate Blanchett
and Rooney Mara. The story and romance while well executed and
beautifully conceived still lacked staying power with me.Good: The movie was gracefully directed with beautiful cinematography.
The colors popped without being overpowering and it had great
production and costume design to get that authentic 50's feel.
Blanchett and Mara are great together as they slowly continue to
blossom in their relationship. It tackles real themes of isolation,
confusion, and love without being overbearing or too political about
it. It was a simple love story with two women and I could feel that
passion come off the screen. Blanchett had class without going too
snobby and Mara was innocent without being naive. Kyle Chandler was
good as the husband to Blanchett's Carol and thankfully he didn't fully
become a jealous nagging stereotype. I do think Mara is the standout
here because the movie is mostly about her and her struggles with her
sexuality.Bad: The movie felt too light at times seeing how it is a love story
that follows the structure we have seen in similar movies. The
performances hold it together, but the story is still rather flimsy.
Aside from Mara's struggle in learning more about her sexuality, the
movie follows a simple romance that never quite excels to greatness.
The movie can also be a tad slow at times by the middle of the second
act.Overall, the performances from Blanchett and Mara are great and the
direction is fantastic, but the movie didn't hit the emotional notes
for me like I wanted it too and it didn't have the heft it wanted to
come across on screen.

I really wanted to like this film because of the subject matter, the
period and the potential to shine a light on the historic struggle of
lesbian women in a man's world of 1950. However it was a drudgery to
keep watching this film to it's anti-climatic finish. The characters
were unemotional and detached. They lacked charisma, chemistry or
passion even when angry, desperate and in love. So unlikable were the
characters that I was unable to raise a single shred of empathy even
when things were uncomfortable and unpleasant for them. This story has
so much potential but it was wasted on flat performances, dull writing,
and long lingering (meant to be dramatic) camera shots. The film was
just plain boring, unimaginative and lifeless.

Carol is a romantic-drama film that's directed by Todd Haynes.The two
main stars of the movie are Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara as
Therese Belivet. This movie is set in 1950s and it follows Carol and
Therese who form a bond,after meeting in a department store,and they
soon begin to fall in love with each other but that is followed by
complicated consequences. I really did not think much of this movie,the
stars do a pretty fine job especially Cate Blanchett but unfortunately
I did not find Rooney Mara's performance to be nowhere near as good as
some have suggested.Overall I would say this is an overrated movie that
got a lot of buzz,which in my opinion came with the leading stars being
female and the subject touching on the lesbian matter (and consequences
of the time period that the movie takes place). The story became
predictable by the end,the direction was not very good either simply
because the way that the director chose to display this movie out has
already been done before many times. However, I did love the score
though,as it made some not-so-well made scenes have more weight to them
and also gave the dialogue a little much needed punch.Also, the
cinematography and the scenery is beautiful throughout as the 1950s
come to life on the big screen in an amazing way. I was bored in some
parts and also had quite a few issues but all in all this is a well
made and good looking/well acted movie enough to get a pass as a GOOD
movie (but not much else).

Good fairy and peripatetic MC, Stephen Fry described the movie "CAROL"
as a 1950's story of a New York woman who goes to a department store to
buy a train set and comes away with a train set plus shop girl thrown
in. It seems, in relation to "CAROL", that Stephen and I saw a
different movie or perhaps it was the same movie seen from different
vantage points, he being very tall and beloved, and I being very short
and not in the slightest bit tolerated. In any case, the movie I saw
was about a woman who loved her daughter so much she wouldn't let her
be held to ransom in a vicious morals based divorce case, but rather
let the young child go, realising that to be true to her own nature and
to go with and not against her own grain, would provide that daughter
with a potent moral example of what a woman and mother could and should
be in the twentieth century and beyond. I must admit "CAROL" was a
bitter pill for me to swallow  for largely personal reasons. More than
one quarter of a century after this film is set, a woman I had once
known perhaps as close as a socialite and a shop girl, lost custody of
her children in a similar based custody case, in Australia  she living
at the time openly with a woman, and her former husband, who brought
the custody case, having "found religion" and a naïve new wife, whilst,
on the sly, maintaining his own boyfriend in a flat attached to his
family home. I don't like being reminded of this, nor of how far some
people will go in order to win  hence my reluctance to see the movie.
But, that's not the fault of "Carol", a film that has spent far too
long in coming to our screens. "Carol" started as a 1952 Patricia
Highsmith book, "The Price of Salt", a bestseller that was ahead of its
time. The film seems now to stand accused of being a bit behind the
times - its script, written by the wonderful, and succinct, Phyllis
Nagy, having been circling LAX in a holding pattern for the better part
of 20 years. Personally, I don't have a prejudice against "Period"
films, especially the period 1952, my birth year  in my experience,
people don't change, only costumes do, and even costumes get recycled,
Just ask ANGELS Costumiers. Neither do I have a prejudice against Queer
cinema  why would I not want to see stories which reflect my own life
experience, even if poor scripting, B grade actors and dodgy production
values have often made me squirm in my cinema. Heck, as a woman, and a
lesbian, I've had a lifetime of paying more for second rate product and
service, for which I'm expected to turn myself inside out with
gratitude. I stress that, in my opinion, "Carol" DOES NOT fall into
this category, nor does anyone associated with this film. Some opinion
has it that "Carol" is a cold and inaccessible film. It has been said
that the film, along with Queer cinema generally, employs some Queer
sub-dialect that makes it inaccessible, and thus unsympathetic, to
outsiders. And that's clearly our fault, as Queer filmmakers. I don't
sympathise with this viewpoint. Though I do agree with the Australian
Poet, Dorothy Porter, author of "The Monkey's Mask"  book and movie-
who once said that we LGBTI people are different, are not the same.
It's not as if we Queers are talking, writing and filming in cuneiform
- we all use Lingua Franca. If you don't get it think Marcel Marceau
and viewer/critic take personal responsibility for your own lack of
sympathy and engagement. "Carol" is an uncommon Christmas Tale, and,
unlike a Christmas cake, parts of it may be difficult to swallow and
even harder to digest. The success of its transformation from a 1952
book to a 2015 film depends largely on the strength of casting, and the
uncommon talents of the women who play Terese Belavit and Carol Aird
and both of these actors have been much nominated but barely gonged for
their roles in this movie. The wide-eyed, super engaging Rooney Mara,
who put in such a ballsy performance in "The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo" did not disappoint me as a girl on the cusp, and must be a shoo
in for the lead in any future Audrey Hepburn biopic. And then, there's
Cate Blanchet, who has been previously directed by Todd Haynes in the
movie "I'm Not There", a rumination on the life of Bob Dylan. Todd
Haynes, perceptively, said that he had directed Cate Blanchet in the
role of a man and in "Carol" he looked forward to seeing if she could
play a woman. Cate Blanchet is not an actor whose career I have
followed with great attention or passion. Prior to "Carol", I confess
the only image I retained of her in the mid ground of my mind was a
glimpse of her prosthetic elfin ears as Queen Galadriel. I guess her
beauty, bearing and intelligence must have registered somewhere in the
back of my mind, but in an attenuated form, like light from a long gone
supernova, registered by radio telescope and explicated and argued over
by unknown academics in abstruse equations. So I went out of my front
door to look at a movie, much as I occasionally walk out of my front
door to look at the night sky above my farm, expecting to see familiar
stars in familiar places, predictable Venus, Orion's Belt, and
expecting nothing much and nothing more after a lifetime of snubs the
like of which you could not conceive. And, expecting nothing,
unexpectedly saw in Carol Aird's hooded eyes, in Cate Blanchet's hooded
eyes , the dark matter that holds our universe together.

This could easily have been one of the best movies of 2015, but it is
not. I liked it but it wasn't as good as it could have been. The family
dysfunction beautifully displayed at Christmas time (symbolic of family
and stress) is not balanced. What should have been a torrid love affair
implied between Therese and Carol falls flat. The chemistry between the
two actresses was glaringly missing. Tightly controlled and magnetic performances by Cate Blanchett and
Rooney Mara (as well as Kyle Chandler as the offended husband of Carol)
are slowed down by director Todd Haynes (of "Far From Heaven") who
seems to focus on visual scenes at the expense of the storytelling.
"Carol" expresses not only a story about two generous souls falling in
love but also the mindset of a society entrenched in hard-hearted
"values". Read the entire review at: www.unhealedwound.com

This tells the tale of how early middle aged Carol Aird (Cate
Blanchett), a soon to be divorced woman, falls in love with Therese
Belivet (Rooney Mara), a much younger and less sophisticated shop
assistant in 1950s New York. Based on Pamela Highsmith's novel The
Price of Salt, it covers the awkward excitement of this fundamental
human emotion, which just happens to be between two women, set against
the strictures, mores and legal situation of the time.It is gorgeously set in wonderfully evocative period locations,
beautifully filmed and captures the time and sense of place
beautifully. Much has been said about the subtle sensitivity of both leads'
performances, and while this is probably the case, somehow it didn't
capture for me the why of what was unfolding  the film just expects
you to accept that this is just the way it is. And that I think is the
challenge of the film: somehow the character development just doesn't
seem to even begin to answer the question "Why are these two women
feeling like this?" We see the negative reasons underpinning why they
may want to change away from their previous situations, but not the
positive of why towards that which is portrayed, particularly given the
challenges they know they will face. My wife commented that the film
didn't add much to what we already knew from the publicity material and
trailers we had seen before other films. The story line is really quite
simple, and the lack of this depth of emotional rationale for me was
where the film could have been much stronger.

Firstly, this film captures the feel of the 50s in Manhattan with it's
art direction and costumes. There was some music from the time but even
more use of would have been good. Didn't like the score composed for
the film that sounded a bit contemporary.Rooney Mara looks very much like a young Audrey Hepburn with the hair
and clothes of that time. She is sweet throughout. Don't understand why
she seemed a bit expressionless in the last few crucial scenes when she
made up her mind. Cate Blanchett acts quite strong and slightly hard
and domineering if not quite predatory. I don't know if it's part of
the character but it would have been more sympathetic if she was less
self assured at times in this role.The story is involving because the two actresses are so watchable. It
isn't that melodramatic by today's standards. To appreciate the drama
one has to apply 50s values since the scandal of a lesbian
relationship. The impact is lessened with all the same sex couples and
modern families today - maybe if it had been made 50 years ago it might
have been quite something. The romance evolves gradually. The love
scenes were oddly dispassionate.Watch this for the 2 actresses. The story isn't shocking - more of
historical interest.

"Carol" is a 2015 movie and considered one of the big awards contenders
this season. Let us start with the people we do not see in the film.
Writer Patricia Highsmith is responsible for novels like "The Talented
Mr. Ripley" and "Strangers on a Train" (filmed by Hitchcock). 2015 is
the 20th anniversary of her death, so it's a nice way to honor her
literary legacy. Phyllis Nagy is the one who adapted her work for this
film here. She has only written (and directed) one television movie so
far and that is already 10 years ago, but that one back then, "Mrs.
Harris", received lots of awards attention too. Director Todd Haynes is
known for writing his own films most of the time, but here he was
"only" the one directing. His most known awards so far include Kate
Winslet's "Mildred Pierce", "Far from Heaven" and I'm Not There.",
another Cate Blanchett movie from 8 years ago.Talking about Cate Blanchett, she is the big star in here and I am
slowly (or quickly) beginning to become a great fan of hers.
Occasionally, she seemed somewhat cold and unemotional to me in past
works, but this may only have been my wrongful perception. I loved her
in "Blue Jasmine" and she is excellent as the title character in
"Carol" as well. It's tough to pick a favorite scene as she shines for
2 hours from start to finish of the movie, but I really liked her
moment of revelation during the hearing with the lawyers towards the
end. Oscar-worthy. She also has good chemistry with her co-star Rooney
Mara. Mara, who has been moving between lead and supporting all awards
season won a Palme d'Or for her performance here and, like Blanchett,
got nominations at many other crucial awards bodies, so the two are
basically locks for an Oscar nomination. I must say she is good, but
nowhere near Blanchett's level, so I was slightly underwhelmed by her
portrayal here. Lacy, Paulson and (especially) Chandler give convincing
supporting performances here too. I especially liked the scene, in
which we see Chandler's character's eyes through the door after
Paulson's character closed the door on him.Finally, there were 3 or 4 great moments, but sadly as a whole, even if
I really enjoyed this film at times, I cannot say it was totally
mind-blowing for me or anything that I would consider among the best of
the year. Thumbs up as well for the soundtrack and all the visual
aspects of the film. If you like the historic tone and context of "Mad
Men", you will appreciate the stylistic side of "Carol" for sure too.
It is a story about a woman who has to give up on love (for a little
while) in order to be allowed to see her daughter. Hpmosexuality was
still mostly a taboo back then, times were entirely different and this
aspect also makes it very much worth a watch for the historic context.
Of course, it's also worth seeing for the difficult relationships
between the characters. A well-rounded effort by Haynes here and I can
see why he and the film are getting so much praise. I recommend the
watch. Thumbs up.

A beautiful made movie. A realistic story very nicely shot. However the
lyrical reviews I do not understand. It is nice and beautiful filmed,
but would people also be so lyrical if the woman would have fallen for
an other man?Honestly, the biggest achievement of the producers of this movie is:
keep you watching for 2 hours, while nothing really happens. Nothing
really happens and still it is not boring. That deserves a big
compliment, but does not make the movie on it self fantastic. There are
better stories out there. And the love scene? it did not go any further
then some hugging....

"Carol" is the latest film from acclaimed director Todd Haynes and
stars Oscar winner Cate Blanchett and Oscar nominee Rooney Mara. It
tells the story of an estranged young woman called Therese (Mara) and a
glamorous blonde in her mid-thirties named Carol (Blanchett), who
develop strong feelings for each other after they meet in a toy store
one day. The film relies on both Blanchett and Mara's uncanny ability to display
so much with saying very little. Carol is in the middle of a nasty
divorce, so her attraction to Therese is part desire and part seeking
some sort of comfort. For Therese however, due to her longing for any
sort of company, it's pure infatuation. She see's Carol as the flawless
angel type, someone whom she feels most at ease with. Mara is terrific
as a vulnerable and sheepish individual not quite sure what she wants
in life yet. But her admiration for Carol is certainly clear and she
projects this through many curious and intense glances and gazes.
Blanchett is similar in her approach, a much more understated turn than
we're used to seeing from her but the role calls for it, and she's
brilliant as per usual. I don't see Blanchett winning an Oscar for this
(nomination at best) but Mara is certainly in a prime position to do
so.Todd Haynes' direction is very assured, once again demonstrating his
confident handling of period pieces.The wonderful production design and
costumes instantly transport the viewer to the 1950's era, and Edward
Lachman's photography is ravishing. "Carol" is a finely crafted love story without bringing much new to the
table. The narrative isn't something you haven't seen before, but
thanks to the excellent performances and assertive grasp of the
content, "Carol" succeeds on many fronts.

This is a quite magnificent exploration of sexual awakening unlike
anything I've ever seen and directed with such a firmness of hand as to
be an immediate contender for Best Director at this year's Oscars. Fans
of MTV series Mildred Pierce will see some similarities, but this is
period movie-making on a peerless scale.Every second of screen time has a period detail that takes your breath
away, so assume an Oscar will also be heading the way of Judy Becker
(Design) and Jesse Rosenthal (Art Direction) as well as Sandy Powell's
costumes. Honestly, it makes Mad Men look heavy handed. That may in
part be down to the gorgeous cinematography by Edward Lachman (Virgin
Suicides). The music by Carter Burwell will also be in the mix come
judgement day. So that's six Oscars before we even get to the main
talking point. So; Rooney Mara or Cate Blanchett?This movie is like watching the equivalent of the Rumble in the Jungle
- the two greatest boxers of their generation, one on the ascent, the
other at the peak of their powers - so too here. Marra the lady in
waiting, Blanchett at a dizzying career high after last year's
electrifying Blue Jasmine performance.As the title character you would expect her to dominate the proceedings
but that wholly underestimates the abilities of Rooney Mara who often,
and tantalisingly, is a doppelgänger for Audrey Hepburn. Consequently
Haynes and Lachman are compelled to hold the camera, long and sure on
her utterly beguiling features. Blanchett, by contrast, can only be
described as both handsome and regal.So, the story unfolds as an elder socialite, Carol, totally disgusted
with her affluent but corporate married life, and a dark past as a -
whisper it because the word could not be uttered in McCarthy's 1950's
USA - lesbian, sets eye on the virginal Mara in a pre- Christmas
department store. The impact on both is immediate. The sexual tension
starts from that very first moment and builds and builds until finally
consummated in a Motel room in the midst of a Thelma and Louise-esque
road trip (albeit one that's driven at a much slower pace).This 'forbidden' love comes with significant baggage; Blanchett's
estranged husband spots it soon enough and uses their 4 year old
daughter as a ransom for her to return to the familial home. This
destroys Blanchett and makes the illicit relationship impossible to
maintain. It's a beautiful celebration of love; what little sex the film contains
- with an OTT BBFC statement that it contains infrequent strong sex -
is both tasteful and genuinely loving.Really it's hard to unpick the complex and symbiotic relationship that
these two women have forged on screen. One performance could not exist
without the other and it is to Haynes' extreme credit that he keeps a
hold on it all and guides it effortlessly into the land of classic
cinema.Go see it before it's too late.

This is a beautiful film about a love story between two women. It
starts when a woman named Carol is going Christmas shopping for her
daughter and the shop clerk named Terese helps her get a gift delivered
to her house. It happens to be that she left her gloves behind and
sends them back to her as well. Then they start to see more of each
other and a real infatuation begins. This film is beautifully shot set
in the 1950's and you really get the Christmas feel to the film. The
relationship between Carol and Terese begins slowly but then really
blossoms into something deep and meaningful. Cate Blanchett as always
is amazing you see her luminous quality as her acting is so effortless.
She has a great chemistry with Rooney Mara and they play off each other
really well. The film as has beautiful music in it and it really fits
the film well. This is one of the best films of the year and a greatromance for the holiday season. I highly recommend this film

25 years ago, I just arrived in Paris. I went to ''la FNAC'' (popular
store here in France) and reached the books floor. There, in front of
the escalator, a pile of white books. On the cover a (bad) drawing of
an ashtray with a cigarette on each side, still glowing. But what
appealed me was the smoke, in the form of two women's profiles, one
blond, one brunette, facing each other, kissing ?I've read the book numerous times since, first in French, then in
English, always moved by the story of Carol and Therese. The only thing
that confused me (to say the least), was the part about Rindy : How
could Patricia Highsmith just let Carol leave her child ? Even more
when I became a mother myself.So, one can imagine how thrilled I was when I heard there would be a
movie. Finally !I first read the script (found it online) and was nicely surprised by
the changes the writer made (and a little worried about some
shortcuts). I found Phyllis Nagy understanding of Carol struggles so
much more accurate. Where (so it seems to me) Highsmith was using
Carol's daughter as a mean to make her story moves forward, I found
Nagy really included that dimension of Carol's life as if she knew or
understood much more about what it means to be a mother. In the script,
Carol is fighting for her child and her true self. This sentence in the
script moved me particularly : ''What use am to my daughter living
against my own grain? She deserves joy. How do I give her that not
knowing what it means myself?" The movie is beautiful. It's not the book. It's Todd Haynes creation.
And you couldn't dream of the better adaptation. So perceptive. So
beautifully shot. For me, the best example of what Haynes achieved is
the scene in the Lincoln tunnel. The perspective of Therese looking at
parts of Carol mixed with Carol's voice, the musics and the memory of
it. Therese falling in love... But it's Cate Blanchett that took my
breath away. She is Carol and much more. She is that woman denied being
herself and suffering because of it but fighting for it and staying
proud, oh, so proud. The mother, the lover, the friend. That scene at
the lawyer's office, at the end of the film, everyone realizes the
absurdity of what they've caused. And faces the consequences. So many thanks to everybody who made this film possible. It means a lot
to me. I hope it'll help people understand that denying someone,
anyone, to be itself never brings any good. (Sorry for the clumsiness, and all the mistakes. I tried my best.)

All the right words have probably been used: stunning, mesmerizing,
tantalizing. All these and the prepared for "love that dared not speak
its name" set in the 50s are what we expect as we sit in the theatre.
However, the words I came away with were not so headlight blinding on a
dark night; rather, the stillness caught me. And when the stillness
ended only the perfectly necessary, perfectly nuanced, movement
captured my eye and held me spellbound into the next stillness. And the
Silences. When did we forget how a silence can speak a thousand
thoughts and ideas and notions? When did we lose ourselves in this
cacophony of voices, unceasing, these incoherent noises? And how can
this newly found silence find us yearning, not for words, no; instead,
we beg, leaning forward in our seats, holding our breath, waiting or
wishing or dying for another glance or equally as satisfying (but now
almost universally neglected) another gentle, almost intangible -
except from the disturbance of air around it - brush of a hand on a
shoulder, and then gasping for air as it finally arrives? When did we
lose the ability to interpret in a glance (and maybe a barely
distinguishable lift of the corner of a mouth with the exact right
shade of lipstick) across the department store floor an existence of
unrelenting and profound loneliness, of desolation, of hopelessness?
When did we lose the ability to say yes to life, and risk, and hoping
the feeling in your gut is telling you this isn't the worst idea ever?
Whenever we lost all these gifts: when we lost silence as an amplifier;
when we lost the ability to translate a touch that speaks what we can't
say aloud into "I love you" and "I need you" and "I will be desolate
without you;" when we lost the ability to say with our eyes alone, "you
are the piece of me I didn't know was missing;" when the choices were
not an easily managed yes or no, but instead asked us the existence
shattering, "shall I give up my soul ... or my soul?" I don't know when
we lost all these gifts of communication, but I found them all here,
watching a film in a small theatre in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and I was
heartbroken and uplifted; terrified by the honesty and horrified by the
cruelty in this world I was invited into; and yet, I am still loathe to
go to another place, another time, where Carol and Terese are not
speaking this language, where I am not the voyeur - the audience
reeling with the profound reminders of how little we need speech, if
only we commit to using every other sense to communicate. AFTER 3 Viewings: Three days ago, I noticed the silences and stillness and how in each
moment of stillness and/or silence the actors'
emotions/micro-expressions/silent communication is amplified. Every
single movement, each touch, each look is devastatingly important.
There is not one extraneous word, look, or moment in the entire film.Yesterday, I saw perspective. If you live in a world with little screen
time, you find the world rarely looks at you with a straight back and a
face looking directly at you. Instead, people tilt their heads, give
sidelong glances, look over their shoulders. Well, this is what the DP
and the Director give us in Carol. Real looks, glances over shoulders,
wry smiles, longing through rain splattered taxi glass. We get a unique
perspective while we watch Carol and Terese. And I was mesmerized. And then today it was the music. It is perfect. And by perfect, I mean,
when you need it, where you need it, providing its own subtext while
seemingly leading you along the way. It is stunning in its simplicity
and yet, I cannot imagine any other film which could so seamlessly
integrate the variety of moods and genres.Finally, making a film is a team sport. Maybe it's because Phyllis Nagy
took her time and waited and worked on this script for decades, or
maybe she wrote it in 6 sleep deprived, alcohol fueled days, chain
smoking American Spirit Cigarettes. However it came about, this script
is gold. Take that foundation, add Todd Haynes and all the crew plus
the actors and you have alchemy at its very core. Cate Blanchett and Rooney together are so profoundly good at what they
do, I found myself not at a film or play, but a voyeur watching a life
unfold. And the story, as told by the team putting this film together,
is possibly the most unnervingly true story ever told on film. And I am
frankly at a loss how to go on now, knowing that I can't see the rest
of it: the dinners, the relaxing into relationship, the constant
conversation between Carol and Terese that involves no spoken words. I
am devastated that I don't get to see the next Act, or even the next
scene. And that, my friends, makes for an Oscar winner...

"Carol" (2015 release; 118 min.) brings the story of divorcing Carol
(played by Cate Blanchett), trying the escape an unhappy marriage, and
the much younger Therese (played by Rooney Mara). As the movie opens,
we see Carol and Therese having a coffee or tea in a posh hotel lobby.
By happenstance, one of Therese's friends is there to meet someone too
but comes over to say hello to Therese. Before we know it, Carol makes
a hasty departure. Then we go back in time as we see how Carol and
Therese meet in the toy department of a large department store. To tell
you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see
for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Todd Haynes, whose
previous movie was the Bob Dylan interpretation "I'm Not There" (also
co-starring Cate Blanchett. Here he tackles the big screen adaptation
of the 1952 Patricia Highsmith novel The Salt of Price (originally
published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan). Deemed too hot for the
1950s, the book was quickly dismissed and forgotten by the public at
large, until it was rescued from oblivion and reissued in the early
90s. A story like this stands and falls with the lead performances, and
Haynes has absolutely struck gold with both Blanchett and Mara. The
Performance from Cate Blanchett (who played another impressive role in
"Truth" just last month) is the more obvious one (has she ever looked
more glamorous than this?), but Mara displays a vulnerability seldom
seen and which will tug at your heart, and then some. If there is movie
justice, they will both receive multiple nominations in the upcoming
awards season.I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the entire movie was shot in
and around Cincinnati (including also Hamilton and Lebanon) in
March-April 2014. For those of us living here, it was a lot of fun to
pick out what parts of Cincinnati appeared in what scenes. (As a
complete aside, my daughter ended up serving lunch one day to
Blanchett, who could be seen frequently in and around downtown
restaurants during the film's shoot. Apparently Blanchett couldn't have
been nicer, and she left a very generous tip for my daughter.) The
movie opened on two screens at my local art-house theater here in
Cincinnati at Christmas, and the matinée screening where I saw this at
today was absolutely PACKED, I am happy to report. Given the positive
buzz that this movie is creating, and assuming great word-of-mouth and
some Oscar nominations, this movie may very well build into a bona fide
hit on the art-house theater circuit. Meanwhile, "Carol" is HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED!

The age difference isn't the relationship's sole hookrather it's where
the women are in their respective stages of life. Carol, having been
pulled through the American Dream, is torn between her loyalty to her
family and her own happiness, while Therese has only started
considering long- term love, realizing Richard could eventually become
Harge. Mara's wide eyes invokes a childish excitement and fear, but
which finds empathy in Blanchett's aura of experience. Deeper, inspired
perhaps by the fearful prospect of losing her daughters in the divorce,
there's a particular scene where Therese is sitting at a piano (if I
recall correctly) and Carol stands behind her elegantly coursing her
hands through the young woman's hair. It's quiet and quaint, though
it's our first tactile piece of evidence that Carol's interest in
Therese extends beyond customer satisfaction. And, more beautifully,
upon analysis, it's perhaps the moment where Carol's motherly duties
are liberated by her motherly love for a woman she can finally love

Absolutely love this film. I've seen it twice already and could happily
watch it a third. Has been beautifully written and acted. Especially
loved the slow burning romance and the loved and passion filled looks
they would send each other. I was very sad when it ended and I wanted
more and more If you want something different instead of the same
romance films that come out every year with just different actors, give
this a watch, a truly beautiful film, that I won't be forgetting for a
long time. I've never seen a Todd Haynes film before but after this
amazing film I will definitely been checking out more of his work. I
also loved the pairing of Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, they are both
stunning women and incredible actresses, you could really see they both
had great chemistry together.

Carol is my favorite film of the year. It is slow paced yet impeccably
detailed in script and acting. As a film student I was constantly told
about the merits of showing and not telling. Carol is quite a
masterpiece in that nothing is ever explicitly stated until the last
act of the story - it is instead hinted at and delivered through the
strength of Mara and Blanchett's gazes at each other, in their deeply
coded interactions and dialog, and in the cinematography emphasizing
their respective distances from each other.The sparse dialog leaves space to observe how the characters approach
each other...cautiously at first and never once being obvious. After
all, in the 50's it was incredibly taboo to be in a same sex
relationship of any sort. The spaces between their lines feel heavy,
and almost uncomfortable in some ways. However this reflects the
tension the characters must have felt in trying to calculate their
interactions - parrying words to determine if the attraction is mutual.Not one moment or line of dialog is wasted in this film. Each shot and
each line convey so much information that repeated viewings will likely
reveal complexities that were missed on the first watch.I have quite a bit of admiration for the script as well as the acting.
Cate Blanchett is a tour de force, and Rooney Mara is alluring and
wonderful to watch. Mostly cautious and reserved, Mara's Therese will
then make a short break into a smile or shy laugh, revealing a deeper
sense that she has held herself back her entire life and is struggling
to allow herself to fully break free.It's been a long time since a film has stuck with me days later, but
Carol has done it. This is a story about falling in love, pure and
simple, leaving behind the tropes and over the top drama that we so
often find in films these days and leaving us with something simple,
elegant, and real.

Todd Haynes makes very good movies and so do the novels of Patricia
Highsmith. Hitchcock's film of her Strangers on a Train and René
Clément's Purple Noon, based on The Talented Mr. Ripley, are undisputed
classics. So, probably, is Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley, which
dramatized the homoeroticism implicit in the books and the perversity
of its repression. The Price of Salt is one of only two Highsmiths in
which the homosexual theme is both primary and explicit (the other is
Small g: A Summer Idyll), and it was first published under a pseudonym,
but in other respects it fits neatly into her canon. There's a sense
that anyone could do anything, anytime, of being watched, threatened,
invisibly stalked, prey to the biology of an amoral species. The Price
of Salt has all of that, with more detective story touches than might
be expected from a novel best known for its place in lesbian fiction.
It is now, from Haynes, one of the best films that he, or any of her
books, has made.

I predict now that Cate Blanchett will get the Oscar as Best Actress
for her starring role in this movie.Well crafted story that doesn't quite go the way you expect it to. All
the acting performances by the major players are worthy. This is a slow
moving story but the performances keep you from straying. Not really a
guy's movie. Years ago this movie would have shocked - not because of
what you see on screen (very tame by today's standards), but the
subject matter itself. I enjoyed this movie more because it doesn't
concentrate on the sexual side of the relationship. It has more to do
with the love between two people - in this case, two women.Cate looks absolutely stunning in almost every scene. Her style of
acting through her visual expressions goes back to the Bette Davis and
Joan Crawford era of acting. Stylish, classy and atmospheric.Also the attention to detail in this movie was first class. It's set in
the early fifties, the clothing, the autos, the stores, restaurants,
diners, motels etc etc - I was in awe of the artistic side of the movie
too.The only reason I haven't given this movie a 10 rating is because I
probably won't re-visit this movie for some years despite how good it
is. But that's only because I know how the story ends. It really is
worth seeing if the synopsis appeals to you. If I was able, I would
give this movie a 9.5/10. I'm sure it will get a few nominations come
Oscar time - and deservedly so!

the movie opens with this amazing score that really sets the tone. It adds flavor to the 1950s version of New York that makes up the
scenery. A fantastic combo of Art Direction and cinematography. Cate Blanchett fits perfectly into this time frame, she was very
romantic. I found it very romantic watching Blanchett as Carol, a older
women whose marriage fails because she can no longer live with the lie
she has inside, and develops an attraction for a young girl played by
Rooney Mara, whose just realizing the same thing. Also like what Kyle Chandler of Friday Night lights fame was doing in
this flick as a husband trying so desperately to hold on to something
he never really had.The movie examines relationships on so many levels, and I just found it
wonderfully done. Recommend.

Director, screenwriter Todd Haynes has created a lush, sophisticated
and patient tale of love between an older and younger woman. Every era
has sexual repression and as we know the 50's seemed a particular
vulnerable time even with its refined clothes and settings. . Blanchett
and Rooney have alluring chemistry together for different reasons based
on their acting abilities and ages. For anyone who knows the
familiarity of your heart racing when love begins will be enchanted by
this movie and its message of clicking instantly with another human
being regardless of sexual orientation.. The love scene between the two
woman is done with beauty, yearning and modesty. Far and away one of
the best films of the year but not for the usual reasons. This is an
elegant presentation of how love always manages to transcend the time,
the place and all other restrictions. Simply gorgeous.

Of the thousands of films I have watched, there are only 7 I have rated
10 and a handful more I have rated 9. All totaled, about 20 films are
in the category of 9 or 10. So a 9 is an extremely high rating. There are 2 specific reasons for why I am not giving it a 10. One is
because of unnecessary gratuitous nudity/sex scene. There is no reason
to show nude sex and it has become a reprobate trend in Hollywood. For
an example of how this can be done in good taste within reasonable
limits, see the love scene in Last of the Mohicans. This is not a
spoiler, because anyone who went into this film not knowing there was
going to be nude sex clearly has no clue whatsoever what's going on in
Hollywood film these days. The other reason I'm not giving it a 10 is
because the acting of Rooney Mara's character's two boyfriends appeared
so poor. As an actor / artist myself, I am troubled internally over how to
achieve the beautiful emotion that Rooney Mara showed, while at the
same time troubled over how to avoid the incredibly bad acting of the
man who played her primary boyfriend. It is extremely difficult to describe what it is that makes acting
appear natural and believable, or appear unnatural and unbelievable. I
don't know if anyone has ever articulated it, and every good actor
should be deeply troubled and concerned with this and unsure where they
themselves fit in that spectrum. It comes down to natural talent -
having it or not having it. In any case, this film displays both. However, certainly camera and editing choices can contribute to how the
acting appears. this may have affected the boyfriend's scenes and it
could have even been more that than it was his acting. It also may be
bad casting. He may be a great actor, just not for this role. Nobody
knows, so we all should shut our mouths about it. In this case, the bad acting has a minor affect, because these two men
in the Rooney Mara character's life simply don't matter to her. And so
it suits the presentation well that their acting - as well as the
writing, direction, and shot list these two men were given to work with
- amounted to nothing. They are intended to not detract from the main
story and the main characters. You could say that all of the content of
the entire film outside of the scenes focused on the two leads is an
intentionally drab background that makes the two leads shine brightly
in the foreground, even despite their subtle acting. My point is that the film is poignant, touching, and beautiful in a
unique manner, with its own style. I will give a few more examples.The DP/ camera chose to use many atypical shots, some of which appeared
awkward and could be called rookie choices. These would typically be
bad things, but in this film managed to work extraordinarily well.
Examples - Medium shots where there should have been closeups. Looking
from behind when we should have seen the front. Awkward security
footage angle from the upper corner of the apartment hallway looking
down at an angle - in the middle of the heated argument between Mara's
character and her boyfriend. And a couple of scenes where the set (such
as the window frames) is framed perfectly in the camera frame - this is
usually corny and distracting. Similarly, some of the montages were unusual in what would typically be
considered a bad way. For example, a montage of all extreme close-ups
with weird ethereal effects on the sound. Nevertheless, these very things that appeared awkward actually worked
incredibly well to create a beautiful and poignant presentation. I've
never seen this affect achieved this way. The acting of the two lead actresses was perfect, as well as that of
the man who played the husband. His acting was perhaps the best in the
film. This man's acting, the subtleties of the rest of the acting, and
the demure and pensive introversion of Rooney Mara's character, all
together made the film. The music was also perfect with the acting, and
overall. There is a certain point in the film after which the film suddenly
starts to come together and become deeply touching. I will say nothing about the story, or reflections about how well this
presentation represents real life homosexuality, or whether this kind
of film should even be made, because that all has nothing to do with
the filmmaking or the acting, and also because anyone who offers any
trueisms on those aspects is sure to be burned at the stake in this
environment.I definitely loved this film and watched it two days in a row. I have
to rate it in the top 20 of all the films I've seen. I would watch this
film a few more times. I could say much more about this film - from the
nuances, to the aching in my heart when I saw the intimacy, to the fact
that the film made me think of a lifetime of lost opportunities. I hope
I've covered it all enough.

I urge anyone who loves classic Hollywood melodramas to immediately see
"Carol." This movie reaches the same emotional intensity and visual
beauty associated with the grand Hollywood tradition of the woman's
picture. Like "Magnificent Obsession" and "Mildred Pierce", "Carol"
casts a perfect balance between style and substance. It is a feast for
the eyes yet deeply involving from start to finish.The ambiance and atmosphere of the 1950s is captured in a way that is
utterly convincing. While the characters happen to be in a lesbian
relationship, the theme of forbidden love is a universal one. Any
sensitive person will be able to identify to some extent with the
characters. The bigotry of the time is captured, but not in a way that
comes off as overly cartoonish. This never feels like a caricature of
the 1950s.My mouth stood open every time Cate Blanchett made an appearance on
screen. She is an astonishingly beautiful woman, and her hair, makeup
and clothing are some of the best I have *ever* seen in a modern
Hollywood movie. It is impossible to take your eyes off of her. Rooney
Mara's understated turn as Therese complements Blanchett's performance
as grand dame Carol beautifully. They have a wonderful sort of
understated chemistry that is truly a joy to watch.This is a must-see melodrama and an essential contribution to Todd
Haynes' already impressive filmography.

CAROL, directed by Todd Haynes and starring Cate Blanchett was the
prestige closing film of the Marrakesh Film Festival, on Dec. 12, 2015.
Haynes is a respected Hollywood director noted for meticulous period
detail and atmospheric reconstruction such as in his 2002 masterpiece,
"Far From Heaven" which starred Julianne Moore in one of her greatest
roles, also set in the fifties. This film, set in the same period with
another great actress, looks like a clone of the earlier opus, but the
cloning just doesn't take.While both the film and Cate look great all the way, unlike "Heaven" in
which the supporting roles were also fully fleshed out and memorable
(notably, her closet gay husband played by Dennis Quaid in his best
role ever) here they are flat as pancakes and, worst of all, the
central same-sex love relationship between Cate and void younger
actress Rooney Mara has no tension, chemistry, reality, or anything
else, which basically leaves the whole picture null and void -- reduced
basically to an extended modeling session for Cate Blanchett, who looks
better than ever draped in furs and perfectly becoming period apparel
from beginning to end, not to mention a perfect blonde coiffure to
enclose her perfect features. In the film Cate, who is obviously wealthy, drives a classy fifties
Packard (at the time thought of as a more stately answer to the high
end Cadillac) and fifties cars buffs will have a field day identifying
the various other vintage models enriching the background throughout in
a picture that doesn't have enough foreground, in terms of an engaging
story or characters, to distract them from counting cars. Richly
photographed and most decorously detailed but overall, one long bore.
Even the potentially strong social question of whether a devoted mother
can be deprived of the custody of her children because of lesbian
tendencies sort of floats by without raising much of a rumpus. As a followup to her Oscar awarded outing in Woody Allen's insufferable
"Blue Jasmine" two years ago, this is another waste of Ms. Blanchett's
enormous talent and screen charisma. Can't blame her though for
accepting leading roles in films by prestige directors like Woody and
Todd -- just too bad -- and not her fault -- that films like this turn
out to be the biggest turkeys of the directors in question.

How can a movie go wrong with Cate Blanchett for its lead? and is it
possible that Rodney Mara is as good as her costar? You can decide that
when you see the very dramatic, moving, artistic, and quite spectacular
account of a forbidden love a few decades ago in New York City. Todd
Haynes surpasses his "Far From Heaven" and "Mildred Pierce", two
projects that were visually impressive and impeccably directed. He has
put together a movie that evokes the past, gets inside the lives and
emotions of two women and to a limited extent those close to them to
give us a look into a society that has long gone. Hasn't it?Carol is an unhappy housewife, a strong woman who feels trapped because
she's not able to live her life freely. She has everything anyone could
wish for: a beautiful daughter, a rich husband who loves her, friends,
but her life is empty until she runs into Therese, and everything
becomes more complicated. Carol knows what she likes and wants. Therese
has needs, yearnings, her own anxiety and sadness, which keeps her from
realizing her professional and personal goals. Suddenly she finds
herself more alive and more confused than ever.As their emotions begin to overwhelm them, we learn the background in
Carol's life. Her marriage is collapsing because of one earlier
indiscretion. Society doesn't know how to deal with the situation, and
her husband is looking for solutions, lashing and demanding, hurting
everyone along the way.Eventually, everything reaches an emotional climax, and we can expect
consequences will be irreversible and devastating for all involved.
"Carol" presents personal, intimate moments which explore the
relationship between the two leads. It dedicates enough time to a few
of the supporting characters so we understand their perspective on
things. It's a more innocent world, but it's no less cruel than what we
deal with nowadays. Society doesn't forgive, and soon, lawyers are
involved.There's a powerful scene that shows "Carol" is about to fall into the
worst imaginable situation. Incredibly, things develop into a much
different way, and at this time, we get to see that the story takes a
couple of unexpected turns. It becomes very realistic, and it reaches
out to the audience so that we become invested in its eventual
resolution. The script is tight, giving us essential points, strong
development, and not wasting time. It is a story with a powerful story,
real, touching characters, and as I mentioned before in the hands of
the magnificent cast, it's almost a perfect movie.Many will love the way the past is brought back to life, with much
beauty and care, a great score, much attention to the look and feel of
a time that has left for the most part, but that shares plenty of
emotions with our contemporary world.

Carol is a subtle and tender love story of two women from different
worlds. Set in 1950's New York, the film is as much a socio-political
comment as it is a romance.Cate Blanchett's Carol is at once both assured and achingly vulnerable.
Her fleeting glances saying as much as a page of heartfelt dialogue.
Rooney Mara's Therese, while not as immediately magnetic, develops into
a wonderfully understated character, that contrast beautifully with
Carol's more overt personality. In supporting roles Kyle Chandler, as
Carol's husband, and John Magaro, as an ally in Therese's life, both
give strong performances. There are no cardboard characters, regardless
of screen time; everyone adds something to the story.Each shot drips with authenticity; the 50's costumes especially, are
just beautiful and a real labour of love in their attention to detail.Carol takes place some 60 years in the past yet it is sad to note that
several in US politics would wish for America today to return to a
society that quietly, but with rigid determination, rejected anyone
that refused to comply with a particular "norm".Many would say that, when it comes to acceptance of same sex
relationships, we still have some way to go and such is the strength of
this film you could move Carol to 2015 and it would not look so out of
time.My personal favourite film of 2015.

Offering a magical combination of atmosphere, bold script and accurate
performances, you would have to search back in the era of Classic
Hollywood, to make the relevant comparisons. I'm betting, it will break
your heart. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) is an attractive woman of the
'50s. She's also on the eve of her upcoming divorce with her husband
(Kyle Chandler). The latest victim of her seductive manners is an
introvert young woman in a mall. Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) wants to
break free from a dead-end relationship with her boyfriend and searches
for something else. Something, she cannot share to anybody.This is the kind of drama, which does not care only for its heroes, but
for the world and the changing rules. Carol respects and appreciates
women's fight for equal rights and beyond a romantic love story at its
core, spreads a great amount of feminist dynamism in the story (based
on Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt). What we are given here, is
a familiar but admittedly- fascinating narrative line. Two souls, not
as tortured as in Brokeback Mountain's gay couple, but with emotions at
similar level expressed, make a journey of self-discovery and
acceptance, through their difficult choices and dilemmas. It is a
painful procedure of self- awareness and it plays wonderfully in the
interplay of the characters, as if you can feel the cracks before the
sudden sound.Todd Haynes (director of Far from Heaven), continues his wanderings in
the land of forbidden passions, now with a greater sense of romance,
taste and technical knowledge. Displaying again his foolproof criteria
on choosing the crème de la crème of associates (in editing,
cinematography, costume and production design) he brings an almost
fetish quality in the way people, color and objects are positioned in
his frames. But thanks to his talent and gusto, this effect is not been
used with a cold stylish approach. It gives the whole set, an elegant,
warm and extremely emotional value. What is left to say for Blanchett's talent? Her instinct, look, voice,
and physical complexion is unbeatable. An electrical performance, from
start to finish. More touching though, here is Mara, and the way she
lets herself to get carried away. The normality of her restraint as an
actress is what makes her, the most suitable person for the role. At
the end of the film, you wish you could hold her in your arms. more on: https://safekryptonite.wordpress.com/

In a time when cinema is dominated by franchises and conglomerate
blockbusters, Carol is a breath of fresh air. From the beautiful
cinematography to the perfect direction, the stunning costume and set
design to the spell bounding performances by both the leads and
supporting cast. Carol is just...words can't even describe it. I'd read
the book before seeing the film and loved it to the point were my
excitement for the film slightly wavered as I didn't think it possible
for the magic I found within the pages to translate with as much
passion and pain on screen. Looking back, I had no worries. Cate
Blanchett, like always, is beyond amazing and Rooney Mara, like always,
is beyond fantastic. Todd Haynes directs the film in his usual
brilliant beauty, truly capturing the 1950's with 16mm film, every
grain taking the audience back in time. Phyllis Nagy's screenplay
brings life to Therese Belivet and Carol Aird just as Patricia
Highsmith intended, making us feel their struggle as they fight against
society and the social ties pulling them apart. Carol is a story about
love in a time when not all love was accepted and for a film such as
this to even be made shows we have in fact come a long way since then.
I recommend everyone see this film.

Carol is set in 1950s New York and is about a young woman, Therese
Belivet (Rooney Mara)who falls in love with a middle-aged wealthy
divorcée, Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett). In this movie Rooney Mara plays
a restrained and very shy character but she tends to open up to Cate
Blanchett's lavish and very confident one. I have to say that I didn't
really like Cate and Rooney's take on their characters. They didn't
feel very realistic or fleshed out enough for me to really get engaged
with these characters. It just felt too cliché . Like they were
portraying a rough caracecher of their personality types. The art
direction and costume design did catch my eye quite a bit. Its
interesting to see the subtle details in the architecture and clothing
design through out the film. The close ups and framing in a lot of
scenes was detailed and well executed but I wouldn't call them
beautiful or breath-taking. A lot of the shots seemed to be dull in
terms of color. They also lacked ambition in terms of exploring
different camera angles and shot setups. The theme of the film was
pretty interesting. Two women are sexually attracted and in-love with
each other during one of the most conservative time periods in American
history. The fact that Carol is so much older then Therese just adds
the theme of rebellion in this film. However, this film isn't very bold
or straight forward. This is a film is kind of about the repercussions
of homosexuality in 1950s. This film could have been much more gritty
but it was filtered and cleaned up into something that the typical
soccer mom can stomach. It really doesn't fully utilize its R rating.
As artful as this film is it failed to actually capture forbidden love
in the same way that "Blue is the Warmest Color" or "Brokeback
Mountain" did. This film was essentially a build up into one sex scene
between the two main actresses and then the repercussions unfold from
there. The only thing that actually kept me engaged was the tension
between Carol and Therese. They really take their time to build up the
tension between the two leads and keep their audience engaged as these
characters are developed throughout this film. I give it a decent 6/10

6 Oscar nominations is way to much for this rather mediocre picture.
Production wise everything is top notch but the story is so mundane and
straightforward. The movie just hobbles along without anything out of
the ordinary happening. Kate Blanchett is excellent though somewhat
typecast as the good looking older classy lady while Rooney Mara plays
the innocent and somewhat naive girl. Rooney Mara does have a lack of
charisma and rather few facial expressions. This was OK and fitting for
the character of Lisbeth in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but not for an
emotional movie like this. If it wasn't for the Oscars I've would have
skipped it completely and I suggest you might do the same.

Carol is a stunning movie.The story of this movie is not very important. It is quite predictable
and, in roughly the second half of the movie, threatens to overtake it,
as it becomes a bit too present and its pace a bit too fast.But what is being shown is the very great merit of this movie. It shows
in a magnificent way the unspeakable sensitivity and softness and power
of being attracted to another person. Watching this movie is like
dreaming the perfect dream of love, which one would like to last
forever.I, for one, was overwhelmed.

There's so much to enjoy in this gem of a movie. Of course, there's the
stellar performance of Ms Rooney and Ms Blanchett, and the way the
story talks to us not only about the love of two women. But it also
evokes an era, not that long ago, in which lesbian love was quite
problematic. The way Mr Haynes kicks the early 1950's back to life is
impressive - even although it appears he got some minor details wrong.
Another minor criticism might be that almost every male in the movie
comes across as a caricature, in stark contrast with the psyche of the
two main characters. This is an intelligent, sensitive movie! As a
bonus for lovers of sensual scenes, one might add that Carol contains a
lesbian sex scene that is both very beautiful and deeply intense...

"Carol," the latest film from director Todd Haynes, covers a lot of the
same thematic and aesthetic ground covered by Haynes' beautiful 2002
film "Far from Heaven." Set in the 1950s, like Haynes' earlier film,
and concerning itself with homosexuality, this time female
homosexuality, in an era when such a lifestyle was nearly impossible
without universal condemnation, it also features exquisite
cinematography by Edward Lachmann and a rarefied period glow that makes
the film feel more like an artifact from an earlier time than a recent
release. If it doesn't have the same emotional wallop as "Far from
Heaven," that's partially because it has a happier ending, and also
because it feels like less is at stake. "Far from Heaven" took on a
whole world of prejudice; in fact, the homosexuality of Dennis Quaid's
character was accepted more quickly than the interracial romance
between Julianne Moore's well-to-do housewife and Dennis Haysbert's
working class gardener. In "Carol," Cate Blanchett brings such a
determined resolve to the title character that you never worry much
about the outcome. If she loses custody of her daughter, which her
husband threatens as a way to keep her on a tight leash, you get the
sense that she'll be fine anyway. And Rooney Mara's Therese is so young
and still discovering herself and the world that you get the sense her
affair with Carol is just one of many transformative experiences that
will make her the ultimate woman she will become. The two actresses are
sensational, Blanchett wafting through the film with an air of regal
melancholy and Mara using her large expressive eyes to convey Therese's
fear and excitement at entering a forbidden world she didn't even know
she wanted until it presented itself to her. It's a film I thoroughly
enjoyed, but it has a colder, more insular quality than "Far from
Heaven." I felt more like I was watching characters in a jar with a
detached interest than going through their emotional journeys with them
in real time.The film also stars Sarah Paulson as Blanchett's friend and former
lover, and though her role isn't large, any movie is made instantly
better by her presence, no matter how brief.There was quite a bit of outrage that this film didn't make the final
roster of Best Picture candidates at the Academy Awards, but it's not
an outrage I share. I admired it but don't think it was Best Picture
material.Grade: A

-Carol is a 2015 British-American romantic drama film directed by Todd
Haynes, from a screenplay by Phyllis Nagy, based on the novel The Price
of Salt (also known as Carol) by Patricia Highsmith. The film stars
Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, and Kyle Chandler. Set in
1952 in New York City, the film tells the story of a young aspiring
photographer and her relationship with an older woman going through a
difficult divorce. Highsmith based the character of Therese Belivet on
herself, after an encounter she had in 1948 with a woman while she
worked at Bloomingdales in New York City. This encounter inspired her
to write the story. -Carol was in development for over 11 years by
British producers of Number 9 Films and Film4 Productions. The film is
co-produced by New York-based Killer Films. Principal photography began
in March 2014, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and lasted 34 days. The film was

Carol is an engrossing and understated drama about two women at
different stages of their lives that realise through their feelings
that they are in love with each other. Their romance is orchestrated by
director Todd Haynes, an openly gay independent filmmaker, who often
makes films about the subject of gender, sexuality and changing social
values. One example of his work was Far From Heaven (2002), which
starred Julian Moore as a housewife who tried to befriend an African
American man amongst the bigotry of the suburbs in 1950s America. With
this film, Haynes has sourced Patricia Highsmith's 1950s novel The
Price of Salt to evoke similar themes of changing values. The novel was
said to be inspired by Highsmith's own relationships with both men and
women. Imagine the controversy it must have arrested at the time. In
the 1950s, America's post-war period was deeply repressive of
homosexuals as it headed into the Cold War. The Lavender Scares was an
example of one of the campaigns used to discriminate and punish
homosexuals, often by associating them with Communists, who themselves
were blacklisted, imprisoned or fired from their jobs. Carol's
recreation of this difficult period is also about today and how the
desire to grasp equal rights and representation is still a struggle
that runs strong. However, Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy opt to observe the
minor behaviour and attitudes of the period and characters rather than
highlighting specific historical moments. The film stars Rooney Mara
(The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) as Therese Belivet, a young woman
that works in a department store. Her main relationship with her
boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacey) isn't romantic or interesting to her.
She's reluctant to travel with him in spite of his persistence. We see
them interacting with their friends, watching films through the
projector window of a cinema or getting drunk together in a bar. At one
point, one of their friends shows her his office in the New York Times
while they drink and then tries kissing her. These are young people who
have limited long-term prospects and this complacency propels the
uncertainty of Therese's life. The life of Carol (Cate Blanchett) seems
equally unfulfilled, despite living under a wealthier social status.
She is deeper into her life than Therese, being a mother and sitting in
the middle of a divorce from her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) and also
having more sexual experience given she once had an affair with her
friend Abby (Sarah Paulson). She bitterly assures Harge that she and
Abby were over long before they were, stressing it wasn't a change in
sexuality that dissolved their marriage. As Harge and Carol argue over
their young daughter, it is clear that he still loves her and can't let
go. But her heart and her eyes fall onto Therese after they meet by
chance at the department store. The gloves she leaves on the store
counter prompt Therese to return them by contacting Carol and entering
her complex life. The uniqueness of their relationship is that the two women are almost
entirely committed by a sense of feeling. The singularity of the
connection is a contrast to films that contrive a romantic connection
by parallel backstories and personal histories. Carol and Therese are
long removed from their experiences in their age (the actors are 16
years apart), their economic status and their understanding of the
world. The weight of their relationship, the content and shape of the
film, is the generous amount of time dedicated towards these two
characters feeling and sensing each other until they realise the binary
of their emotions. Initially, Therese is deeply unsure of herself. She
can barely decide on her order when the two women eat lunch together
and she won't leave her boyfriend even though she doesn't love him.
Rooney Mara, with her best performance, beautifully paints the shyness
and delicacy of Therese through a quiet, nervous energy that filters
through her sad face and eyes. A deep emotional resonance protrudes
through her displacement, particularly a sad scene where she helplessly
observes Harge and Carol fight and then cries on her way home.
Meanwhile, Carol's self-confidence and dry wit corrodes with the
realisation that these are feelings of love, not lust, that are
infiltrating her life. Given Therese's young age, it is a passage of
uncertainty for Carol herself when she concedes with Abby she doesn't
know what she's doing. Both women are coming of age, but at different
stages of their lives, realising what satisfies them sexually and
mentally and having the power of choice, free from the men who
disappointment them but regularly prolong their romantic feelings
because it's all they understand. These are not terrible men but merely
incapable of comprehending the interiors of women. Richard ridicules
Therese when they discuss being in love with someone of the same
gender, perhaps because people rarely talked about the subject openly
in these times, which further underlines the theme of uncertainty in
this period.

Writer-Director Todd Haynes film "Carol" is not filled with carols of
joy, but works very effectively. It centers on a lesbian relationship
set in 1950's New York between a chain-smoking socialite named (see
title of movie) and a shy shopgirl named Therese. As many of Haynes
movies, it has that cinematic aura of the golden era of Hollywood;
which he puts his Haynes on for. The character Carol, genuinely played
by the great Cate Blanchett, is going through the first phases of a
divorce from her alcoholic & abusive husband Harge; and yes, Harge was
a bit harsh on Carol. Carol then unexpectedly meets Therese at the
department store where Therese works at, and an instant connection
develops that consequently develops into a gradual unification. Rooney
Mara was astounding as Therese and is very worthy of her Best
Supporting Actress nomination; even though "Carol" should have really
been titled "Therese", you get my Therese thrift? Chandler (who is a
profoundly underrated) was strong as Harge in his supporting
performance. Carter Burwell's soothing score was the best I have heard
in a motion picture this year; score that one for an Oscar win in my
book. "Carol" does move a bit slow (in more ways than one) so please be
patient with it, but at the end I am sure you will enjoy the "Carol".
**** Good

. . . proves far more tedious than laboring up BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN,
which most likely is why the Oscar voters could not bring themselves to
award CAROL with one of its two vacant Best Picture slots for 2016.
There are no fist fights, back-seat trysts, or mountain scenery in
CAROL. Even CAROL's sex scenes are tawdry and tame by BLUE IS THE
WARMEST COLOR standards. Of the two fairly Uninvolving characters
featured here, the possibly asexual Therese just goes along to get
along. She's easy to cook for, eating anything put in front of her. But
the younger Therese is the more practical gal in this pairing--the one
most likely to know the price of salt, for instance. (However, this
flick's second ending, in which Therese seemingly does not know how to
quit Carol, seems forced and contrived.) The older title character, on
the other hand, apparently never learned from her own mom that a girl's
expected to sleep in a bed after she's made it. Carol has bamboozled a
Rich Guy with no imagination (please excuse the redundancy) into
setting up a home and making a baby together. Then she turns his life
into a Living Hell, because she's been swinging from the other side of
the plate her entire life. CAROL is a gay version of THE GREAT GATSBY's
Daisy Buchanan, plowing through her circle not caring whose life she
wrecks.

I gave some claps after the movie ended, so I did think it was good.
The cinematography was beautiful, the music was great, the movie did
well in capturing emotions, and the acting definitely deserved the
nominations.However, the love story was quite unconvincing. For some reason, Carol
just sets eyes on Therese and goes after her. And for some reason
Therese just gets obsessed with Carol. All of a sudden Carol's inviting
Therese to everything and Therese is getting all awkward around Carol.
Don't you know that in a love story you need to at least explain why
they got attracted to each other? The sex scene was good, but you can't
just throw that out there and claim that that's chemistry. The
development was very weak. For the first half of the movie, it was
pretty much just Carol seducing Therese and inviting her over. It
really just seems like a lesbian hook up, but half way through the
movie we're supposed to accept that they're the love of each other's
lives? I've seen some complaints about this movie and I do agree on
this: The romance seems so forced and rushed, are we just forgiving it
because it's a gay relationship? If we take the gay context out, switch
the roles of Carol and Harge, make Harge the one ending the marriage
and hitting on young girls, would people still be okay with the way the
story was developed?And I think the directors really need to understand that being gay
doesn't justify everything. It explains why Carol didn't want to be
with her husband, but it doesn't justify her abusing him and ignoring
him and lying to him. It explains why Therese decided to give up
everything with Richard for Carol, but both Richard and Harge were good
guys, it's not okay to abuse them like that. It would be one thing if
Therese told Richard "I realized I'm gay and I decided to follow this
woman so let's break up", but it's another that she denied it, lied to
him, and still used his feelings for her. OK I realize this is the
50's, but still, by victimizing Harge and Richard, I lost a lot of
compassion for Carol and Therese when things didn't work.And Carol's character just wasn't very likable overall. If I had to
pick a villain of this film, it would be Carol. Lesbian or not, she was
having affairs. Her husband tried to ask her to stay, and she abused
his decency. She seduced Therese, and irresponsibly brought Therese
with her on her get away trip, then dumped her because she made a
mistake and got caught. She seemed to love her daughter, which was
probably her one redeeming quality, but then at the beginning of the
film she gets her daughter a train set even though her daughter wanted
a doll just because she was busy seducing the cute little salesgirl.
She claims to love her daughter, but won't compromise anything to Harge
even if that was the only way. She dumps Therese and gets her lawyer to
make a convincing case for her to gain custody, and she screws his hard
work. Yeah I know nobody's a saint, but by making Carol so unlikable,
they really make this story a lot harder to sell. I was really
surprised that they had a happy ending. In some ways, it didn't seem
like Carol deserved it, and Therese deserved more to move on.The story was a good story. The filming was outstanding. But it's not a
masterpiece.

There have been made numerous films about the love between two women
and this year's Carol is the best of all.Everything in this movie doesn't occur by luck, but only to reveal the
reasons these two particular women fall in love.Carol and Therese don't have much in common, basically on their age and
status, but together they share an intent feeling, which indicates that
love has no logic.And in this, logic lies upon the love between people of the same sex.
Nowadays, this phenomenon has started to escape from the stereotypes,
but for thousands people it is still a stereotype. Let alone in 50s,
where the movie is set.Carol risks it all to have Therese and loses her daughter, but through
Therese she manages to replace the affection she misses from her own
child.Carol felt imprisoned in her marriage and when she got disappointed
from the cruel ways of her husband, she decided to return to a woman's
lap.Carol realized that this is what she really wants and that is how
Therese interpreted her own engagement to this story.Therese is a girl who doesn't know what she wants to do in her life and
is astonished from the luxury of Carol, so she follows her, because she
above all admires her. Therese is curious of Carol's superior life.She isn't really interested in boys and actually is experimenting on
them in an attempt to understand herself. You can tell by the way she
acts when she is by their side. She can't ascertain whether she wants
to be with boys or not and eventually finds love in Carol.Despite their differences, Carol and Therese do have something in
common: Both have tried to connect with men, but didn't succeed in
feeling what they wanted and achieved that in the eyes of one another.Carol links Therese with her daughter. In the scene in Therese's house,
Carol sees Therese in a picture, where Therese is in the age of her
child, she remembers her daughter and cries.Therese goes to comfort her and that is what Carol expects from
Therese: to replace the love of her child that she can't have because
her husband took it from her.Therese sees Carol as a teacher and as more experienced and sure of
herself, Carol is the one that makes Therese fall in love with her.
Carol needed a strong feeling again after divorce and found it in
Therese.There is also an unconscious connection with Carol and Therese that
makes their relationship work even more.Through their experience, Therese reaches the level of Carol and Carol
kind of falls into the level of Therese. Therese flourishes when she
gets to know Carol better and seems to have a better psychology, while
Carol loses it all.Despite the triumph of love, which theoretically is something jolly,
the movie has music themes in sadness which make the story even more
moving.Its sadness has to do with the treatment that women's love had in those
years. It was almost impossible for two women to be together, so
inherently the birth of such a feeling was a curse. Not in this piece,
because of its value.The ending is a weird one and lets the spectator decide what he sees.
Is it in Carol's fantasy or really Therese wants to be with her?

Incredibly well crafted . . . I rarely give a 10, but for this, in a
heartbeat.So many other reviews have already stated in so many words what I would
offer here, so I'll keep this brief, but hopefully informative.To start with, I could watch Kate Blanchett in just about anything, but
here, she is absolutely spectacular. This may well be her best work
ever, and I've seen most of it.That's not to take anything away from Rooney Mara, who was the perfect
match for Kate's character in this film. Considering that her previous
starring role was as the Lisbeth Salander character in "the Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo", this is an excellent example of her range as an
actress.As for the film itself, the attention to detail is superb. The artistry
of the period piece is recreated in such a way that really teleports
the viewer into that time, effortlessly.The story is, well . . . a love story, set against a difficult set of
circumstances.Yes, it does revolve around the emergent lesbian relationship between
the two main characters, but there's so much more to this.To categorize this as a "gay" movie would really be missing the point,
and somewhat sidetracking the focus of this being a great example of
filmcraft at its best.Whatever your interests or proclivities might be, the time spent to
experience "Carol" should be well worth it.

What does one expect when the opening credits say "Based on the novel
by Patricia Highsmith ("Strangers on a Train", "Talented Mr Ripley")?
You expect a dead body. If not in the first part of a film, at least by
the middle of it. We catch a fleeting glimpse of a gun at some point,
but still no dead body. And finally the closing credits begin to
roll... and still no dead body! Apparently, unlike her psychological thrillers, the novel the movie is
based on ("The Price of Salt") was not even published under Patricia
Highsmith's name back in the 1950s. For obvious reasons - it's a love
story between two women. Highsmith admitted to writing the book only
some time in the 1990s.Don't get me wrong. I didn't dislike it - it's just I expected
something different, something more. It's very stylishly made with
stunning cinematography, grainy vintage look, moving performances. As
one reviewer wrote, "every glance means something, no strain shows".
And how come Rooney Mara's Oscar nomination is in the supporting
actress category? Clearly, both she and Cate Blanchett are leading
roles and share an equal amount of screen time. However, at almost two hours it's a bit too long for a film without a
dead body. And it somewhat lacks substance. If it was a romance between
two straight people, critics wouldn't give a toss about it. But because
it's lesbian and we are oh-so-liberal today the movie has been hyped up
beyond its worth. In a way, just like "Brokeback mountain", it's a gay
movie for straight audiences.

Finally saw "Carol" a Todd Haynes directed film which is a strong
showcase and focus of a look at two bold female characters and a
spotlight of how passion is made despite their different backgrounds.
Set in early 1950's a time when most of America was still conservative
and a gay loving relationship between two ladies was certainly not the
norm, still it happened and this film highlights it in a loving and
strong passionate way.Cate Blanchett(in a strong performance)is Carol Aird a proper and rich
socialite New Jersey housewife who's on the verge of a divorce and a
custody battle. So it's clear that Carol is at a crossroads and needs a
new personal adventure so just before one Christmas as Carol takes a
shopping trip to New York's Manhattan at a high end department store at
the doll section she meets Therese(a speak for herself performance from
Rooney Mara)an innocent yet attractive and nice looking clerk that
catches the eye and attention of Carol. After this chance meeting the
two hook up again to get to know one another better.Slowly but surely the friendship leads to a holiday road travel trip
with a lot of conversation and getting to know one another much better
occurs. You guessed it the passion and sparks fly with intimate love
making as the love scenes are really erotic and bold in a provocative
nature. This is a film of more than about love and passion between two
women, it's message is that anyone can be a lover with anybody as the
time and culture doesn't matter as love and passion should outweigh the
norm of society. And love no matter how not the norm is possible for
people from two different culture and living backgrounds. Overall
"Carol" is a statement of love and culture proving that it can happen
even in the expected norm of society.

Carol was different. I was expecting a great film full of contents and
that was what I got. I was very satisfied with it but, nonetheless I
was kinda shocked. In a good way. This film had a big impact on me. And
this is so important with art (yes, movies are art) but it's not much
considered nowadays. The directing was good but it didn't convince me.
You can clearly see the big potential of Haynes but I think it could've
been used better, or at least pushed a little more. The score was just
beautiful. It totally throws you back into the '50s. I loved the
different development of the two characters even though, in my opinion,
the finale is too quick. It looked like the times of the film are
perfect both to create a story and to let the viewer "interact" with
the protagonists but at the end it's like they didn't have anymore time
so they don't give enough space to let things evolve in a natural way.
Although a it was a wonderful film and very enjoyable to watch.

When i first start watching this movie i thought that it is a cliché
movie about women rights at early 19's century. but as the movie
continued i saw a production like i had never seen before. The screen
play was unique. Cate Blanchett's act simply blew me away. and next to
that Rooney Mara's act made it so wonderful. but the most greatest
thing about this production was the score. when it starts with a simple
piano followed by violin... and then suddenly... the sound of harp.
only 5 notes... the most brilliant score of this year. it completely
moves you with the story. i can honestly say you can not find anything
wrong about this production. everything was perfect. the act, the
music, production design, makeup, costumes, screenplay and etc. i can
say simply wonderful.

It's not often that a film like Carol comes along. A film so
beautifully shot, about such important subject matter, so flawlessly
acted; leaving one in a state of shock after the first time they have
seen it. Such an important film, Carol is one that will restore your
faith in the current state of cinema. In the age of Hollywood
blockbusters, simply trying to fill seats with copious amounts of
action, it is reassuring that a work of true film art, such as Carol,
is still being so exceptionally made.To pose the claim that Carol is one-dimensional could not be farther
from the truth. Love, self, society, and sacrifice are explored in the
film Carol; issues which affect each individual. Passively observing
her life unfold, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) exists as an unfulfilled
being in all aspects of her life. Living in a shabby New York apartment
which she cannot even afford to adequately heat, Therese stumbles
through her daily existence. Riding on the handlebars of her insipid
"boyfriend" to her daily work at a department store where she is
reduced to just another holiday hat wearing drone, it is clear to see
that Therese is unhappy with the dull ache that has become her life.
Finding refuge in her photographs, Therese escapes her unhappiness and
finds fulfillment in honing her photography talents. One magical day
changes the course of Therese's mundane existence. A stunningly classic
beauty exuding wealth named Carol (Cate Blanchett) happens upon
Therese's display at the department store. There is moving art in their
exchange, as one can soon pick up on the discontent Carol projects ever
so subtlety. Carol Aird is a prisoner of her own life; stuck in a
loveless marriage, mother to a child she adores, Carol is living proof
that even when one enjoys great wealth, as she does, happiness can
still only be an illusion. Sharing a mutual distaste for their own
lives and harboring feelings they themselves were often too afraid to
feel, Carol and Therese set out on to travel; to escape their glum
realities, even temporarily. As the two continue their quest, protected
by isolation, their inhibitions dissipate, and they begin to explore
the loving reality that is their relationship. The internal struggle of
being a married lesbian mother in the early 1950's proves too much for
Carol to bear, as she abandons the trip and returns home to fight for
custody of her daughter against her imposing husband Harge (Kyle
Chandler) Devastated at the seeming end to the purposeful existence she
has so longed for, Therese finds it impossible to return to her normal
work at the department store. Invigorated by a new sense of purpose,
Therese channels her pain in her pictures, taking a job at a newspaper
where she can explore photography full-time. Carol also finds it
intolerable to return to her prior life; renewed with strength, Carol
finally stands up to Harge, vowing to never again go against her grain.
Carol is what she is, whether society approves or not, and after she
realizes that, there may be hope yet for true love.Based on the novel The Price of Salt, by Patricia Highsmith, Carol is
beautifully photographed against the seminal images of life in the
1950's. Edward Lachman's cinematography work on this film is nothing
short of poetic, as the audience is guided deeper and deeper into the
crux of forbidden love in the "good ole' days". Cate Blanchett turns
out a career best performance as the titular character defined by the
society she is a part of, yet wants nothing to do with. Rooney Mara's
performance of a young girl learning about even the suppressed facets
of her own self was stellar. The direction of Todd Haynes was
extraordinary in delivering such a raw, relentless love, told almost
exclusively through subtlety. Powerfully shot with a heavy reliance on
filming through windows or opposite mirrors, Haynes allows the audience
to explore how much of their selves can only be viewed from within, and
how much of a distorted display our true self is when exposed to those
around us. Accompanied by a powerful score, Carol is a masterpiece to
be viewed the world over for its brilliance in capturing feelings so
relatable to everyday life within the human condition.Brilliantly written, with remarkable production design and costumes,
Carol is the most beautiful film I've seen in years. A truly
intoxicating experience; if given the chance, Carol transforms the
viewer to a place where it is not OK to be who you are meant to be, and
on some level, everyone can relate to this feeling. A rare form of near
perfection is captured on screen through Todd Haynes' masterwork. Carol
is a film that should be enjoyed by masses for years to come.

This was melancholy, lush, and resonant, all with gentle restraint from
showing off the quality of the sets, costumes, actresses, direction,
etc. The movie also avoids being voyeuristic, even with the inclusion
of a privacy-violation plot-line regarding the romantic (and sexual)
lives of the main female characters. Complexities such as Carol's
divorce, Carol and Therese's age differences, and ex-interests are
covered with both grace and reality which makes the whole film feel
emotional - across a spectrum of being heartwarming and heartbreaking -
even at its resolved, triumphant, and warm moments. The movie seems to
mostly rely on emotional drive, in fact, with the eventual sex scene
being both very respectful and serving a purpose to the story (not that
plot point status is entirely necessary in a movie, but seems like it
is here in choosing why it is disclosed to us) and with the technical
components of life being factored into the plot through their emotions,
such as in Therese's hesitation to leave NYC with her boyfriend, in
Carol's divorce and custody battle, in Therese's career aspirations,
each of which are included to color the emotional states of the
characters involved at each part of the story-telling of this
relationship's time-frame. The movie also is assuredly beautiful in a more general sense, with
vivid performances and great costumes, sets, shots, and music. The
framing of the story is also artful, especially given the clunky or
underwhelming nature of many romance movies' beginning and ending
territories. Also, for the record, I am queer and much of the poignancy and spark of
this movie related to a relationship I had with a woman for much of the
past year; I was wary of this movie but found it to tell a humanizing
and beautiful story, while also resonating with me more than other
bittersweet love stories have since my breakup, which may seem
irrelevant but I mean to say that I would recommend this movie to
anyone and don't believe the people who worked on this have mistreated
the subject matter of a relationship between two women.

It is always difficult to make a choice in life because of the variety
of things presented to us. Whether it is what we want to eat, what
color we want to paint the room, or even what our favorite movie is.
After tonight, I undoubtedly have made my choice about at least one of
them. Carol is intoxicatedly real, passionate and classy. I feel
empowered to believe in the impossible after seeing the enchantment
enfold on the big screen, the costumes and set designs were made to
accentuate the romance, and boy do they. Both actresses have a complicity that can't be faked and they are
astonishing, lifting each other up in their acting. Cate Blanchett is
incomparable, with a gaze of eroticism surrounding her at all times.
The amount of guilt and compassion the viewers feel along their journey
transcends all expectations. Carol barely touching Therese's shoulder,
a caress of hands or quick glances across a room turn a movie into a
masterpiece. The only downside is that it did not last forever.So, if someone asks me what my favorite movie is, the choice will be
very simple from now on, and it will be Carol.

Love is a tricky thing. It can lift you to heights of joy and
creativity and give you a sense of purpose and the promise of an
exciting future sharing your life with someone. It can also plunge you
into the depths of despair and make you perform horrible acts due to
jealousy and pain, destroying the object of your affection for selfish
gain. If you love truly though, no matter how it manifests, you will
discover something new and honest about yourself for better or worse.
This is the theme that underscores Carol, the new and engrossing film
from director Todd Haynes. Guided by a stellar screenplay by Phyllis
Nagy, Haynes has created a nuanced tapestry of love in all its splendor
and horror, chronicling its joy and destruction leading to a journey of
self-discovery.Carol, based on the novel "The Price of Salt" by Patricia Highsmith,
opens in New York City in the 1950s. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett/Truth,
Cinderella) is having a quiet, somewhat intense and unheard dinner
conversation with Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara/The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo, Her). The conversation is cut short when...Read the full review on David 'n the Dark!https://davidnthedark.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/carolreview/

Carol, directed by Todd Haynes, captured many hearts of the audience.
It is a film about pure love shared by two women of different ages and
different worlds, hindered by the time and circumstances they were in.
It's not just a gay film. It's truly a love story. Simple as it may seem, Carol leaves a huge impact that was carefully
formulated primarily by the brilliant minds of Ed Lachman, Phyllis
Nagy, Carter Burwell, Sandy Powell and of course, Todd Haynes. Lachman, as the cinematographer, guides you in every detail that you
need to see. Every glance, every smile, and every gesture were
highlighted in a way that makes the camera an observer's eye. That is
one of the main goals of this film  to observe, secretly but closely.
To observe how love blossomed between the two women while circumstances
prevented them from doing so. Lachman further outdoes himself by
successfully showing us the 1950's. The people and environment
surrounding the two main characters were captured very well, giving us
a taste of what it felt like during that particular time.Carol's screenplay was written twenty years ago and there were about
two failed attempts of making the film. Phyllis Nagy got cold feet and
once decided to not push through with the film anymore. Huge thanks to
the people who convinced her to give it a shot again, because
otherwise, we would not have witnessed the magnificent adaptation of
Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt. Nagy's screenplay was faithful
to the book and was able to make us feel what Highsmith would really
have wanted us to feel. The main thing that made the story richer was
adding Carol Aird's point of view. In the novel, everything that
happened was shown through Therese's eyes. In the film, Carol was given
her own voice thus letting the audience clearly see the differences of
their perspectives and the similarity of the weight of their
sacrifices. Nagy chose to end Carol similarly to how it ended in the
book and that was one of the most heart gripping moments in the film. To say that almost all scenes were heart gripping is not an
exaggeration. With Carter Burwell's soundtrack, the film transports you
into a place and time which lets you feel the gravity and reality of
the situation you are seeing. The effect is not forced, but gradual,
leading you on, and satisfying you afterwards. As one critic mentioned,
Burwell's soundtrack transformed Carol and Therese's flirtations into
sex. Nothing can beat that. Another magic that was put into the film was Sandy Powell's costume
design. Carol was breathtaking in every scene, even the ones when she
was swearing and crying. The obvious difference between Carol and
Therese's way of carrying themselves shows how they came from two
worlds apart. They were not the only ones who were shining in their
costumes, but also Abby and Harge, Carol's best friend and ex-
girlfriend, and her husband, and basically everyone you can see in
every frame. Leading this brilliant ensemble is Todd Haynes who once again proved
that he is one of the industry's greatest directors. Haynes crafted his
masterpiece in a very subtle manner, slowly creating a huge impact that
would leave you silently taken by the film for hours, days or even
weeks after you've watched it. It's haunting because it was shown in a
way that made it so real, which is how it should be. Haynes' direction
of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara was beyond beautiful. Blanchett was
consistently magnetic. She could make you fall in love with a stare.
Mara's portrayal of Therese effectively showed the character's
innocence and her journey towards self- discovery. Haynes' depiction of
the two women's love scene was one of the best parts. It was very
evident that the director wants the audience to witness something that
is full of respect, pure admiration, and love. Haynes obviously wins in
this part.Last but definitely not the least, the glorious cast ensemble deserves
great recognition. The chemistry between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara
was so natural that it would make you wish you can know for sure that
Carol and Therese definitely ended up together. It seems like you grow
closer to them as the film progresses. Another thing is the fact that
they looked so timeless. They can be imagined in another era together
and they would still look as perfect as they are in the 1950's. Sarah
Paulson and Cate Blanchett's chemistry was also remarkable. They are
the kind of former lovers that you would still want to see as good
friends because of the obvious fact that one cannot survive without the
other. It was lovely to watch them talk about their personal lives and
lovers, without awkwardness or bitterness, but just pure love and
acceptance. Carol is a legacy. And the film being a masterpiece is not the only
reason behind that. Its underlying message that lets the audience think
about the situation sixty three years ago, when there were a lot of
women who were like Carol and Therese, loving each other in spite of
what the whole world thought of them. Without these women, their voices
and struggles, we won't have any amount of freedom and acceptance
today. They made sure that our generation would have the liberty to
love and for that, they would always be dearly remembered. For a film to achieve greatness in form and in content, Carol
absolutely wins.

... what you're doing?" ... and Carol answers: "I don't. I never did."
Here she does - and learning it the hard way. In the behind-center is
her daughter. When she finally has to choose she chooses her daughter,
forced not by her husband but by society at large. It seems that she
sacrifices her true nature, her lesbian nature, forcing herself to live
what she never will be able to do - even with the help of therapy (as
the author did. To afford the therapy aiming 'to be normal' Patricia
Highsmith worked for some short Christmas-weeks at
Bloomingdale/Frankenbergs. Here she met the real Carol, Mrs E. R. Senn.
Be normal. She also tried an engagement. Her fiancé knew that she was
lesbian. In the movie Therese is a short time engaged to Ralf, as
Patricia Highsmith was... Who is the looser, who wins? In this story which repeats itself who
ever is confronted by the ordeal of divorce? Not she, not he or them.
We all are the instrument of a society that does not permit
un-normality. Society is the looser. And Carol (loraC is a well known
perfume!) gives her daughter as a gift for the future an example how
the grown- up daughter can remember what her mother did when everything
was at stake and she perhaps is in the same situation. For young
Therese (she is not yet a mother - has not Carols experience) it is not
easy to understand when reading Carols letter. By not following society's view of what is normal-not normal but
forming as alternative a room of freedom in which Carol shows how and
what to do in such a situation. Seeing her daughter as society-Harge
wants it. Not wanting a warlike fight-back. But accepts the
consequence-acceptance. The most precious Carol and Harge have is of
course their daughter. Unworthy to fight in a warlike battle. By not
fighting allows her a space of freedom: give the law what the law wants
and you have every kind of freedom you want, need and wish. It is this
Carol realized and put into practice. If Harge is not able to accept -
which he did - will they meet in court. Like this both won - focused on
the child. Their child. Therese, her "angel flung out of space". She is asked to come and meet
Carol. To extend the happy ending for a moment Therese denies to move
with Carol to the spacious flat for two. She leaves - - - only to
return. Seeking with her eye Carols gaze they connect. Harge and Carol
sold in the process of their divorce the house. She lives, as she tells
Therese, in an apartment for two. For them. The author of the book was herself lesbian, broke up from an
engagement. The real Carol Patricia Highsmith met when working at
Bloomingdales for a short time where she met the real Carol. Inspired,
she wrote the same evening an outcast of some pages. It was Kathleen
Steen from New Jersey - married and two children. Depressed and heavily
alcoholic she committed suicide in the garage Haloween 1951. Patricia
Highsmith was unconscious of this. More information in this matter can
be found in Andrew Wilsons book 'Beautiful shadow', 2003. When she saw
Kathleen Steen at the department store she was already an active
lesbian. Published 1984 - her choice of name was Claire Morgan. 24 may 1989 she
published the book as 'The Price of Salt'. For 40 years she denied
authorship (now after 60 years the movie). We all know that nothing is
for free. Everything has its price. And must be payed. The not normal
are well aware of it. Salt is need in our food. Not too much, not too
little but: salt. The book closes with the authors own words, written
24 may 1989. The response of her book was huge. Many recognized
themselves, thanking her for many years for her courage.The German DIE ZEIT's (Nr 51, 2015:59) critic of Carol is headed 'Das
Ideal einer Affäre'. Is it really an ideal if we all know of the price
of salt? Is it worth? It is! A fairytale tells of a king, asking his
three daughters how they love him? More than: what? The youngest
answer: more than salt. Everybody is chocked and the daughter is banned
from the country. Soon salt is gone and the father understands what his
daughter meant. Eventually she returns with a magic bag with salt to
heal the sick, among them her father. Carol tried but could not, waiting for ... For what? Therese! For salt.Mihály Csikszentmihályi wrote 1990 the book 'Flow, The psychology of
optimal experience.' Too much is stress, too little is boredom. Neither
stress or boredom is flow. It is this experience the road movie Carol
describes. The hard way. PS: While deciding, thinking and writing,
having seen the movie 3/three times ... 'All that Heaven Allows' 2002 with Julianne More and Denis Quaid.
The same director: focused homosexuality and the attitude towards the
'black' in the fifties.

An aspiring photographer (Rooney Mara) develops an intimate
relationship with an older woman (Cate Blanchett).Before going in to this film, I initially believed it was one that
should have made the cut for Best Picture in place of "Brooklyn",
especially given how little "Brooklyn" had going for it. Having now
seen them both, I think the right decision was made. Perhaps "The
Danish Girl" deserved the boost, but "Brooklyn" is the superior film to
"Carol".What "Carol" has going for it, of course, is a well-acted romance. Cate
Blanchett is at her finest, a lesbian who has tried and failed to live
a "normal" life. She had a husband she could not love and a child she
does, and it was emotionally damaging to her. Blanchett portrays this
range well, someone wise enough and confident enough to know what they
want, and yet aware they are in a world that cannot allow it.Rooney Mara is coming from the opposite end. Her character is naive and
still learning the ways of the world. She seemingly does not know her
own feelings, at least at first, being pursued by a man but not
necessarily knowing why she is not interested in him. Her story is one
of discovery. At times we almost feel she is being taken advantage of,
though this is not the intent. Mara just does such a fine job of
successfully communicating the life of a young woman who does not yet
know her place in the world.Why this story fails, though, is because of the pace. What could be a
steady, moving story of romance and a photographer who is moving up in
the world tends to drag. The score could put an audience to sleep and
the editing does little to keep the film moving. All the hard work that
went into making these characters is hindered by their being trapped in
a slow, thudding picture.The nominations include score (which seems wrong) and cinematography
(which is fair but there is nothing spectacular here). There is also
adapted screenplay, which I could not say one way or the other without
reading Patricia Highsmith's novel. So for these it is a no, a no and a
maybe. I would also expect no win in costume design. So we have four
nominations (very impressive) but nothing to show for it.Where we might see an award is in the acting category. Both Blanchett
and Mara were nominated. Unfortunately for Blanchett, she was nominated
for Best Actress, a category that almost certainly will go to Brie
Larson for "Room". Mara is considered a Supporting Actress, which makes
her biggest contender Jennifer Jason Leigh for "Hateful Eight". And I
would not count out Alicia Vikander for "Danish Girl", either.In short, we have six nominations, five of which are not likely to
become wins. Rooney Mara is the film's best bet to win an Oscar, but
she has a little competition. It would be hard to decide, as Leigh
seems to be the front-runner and personally I thought Vikander was
great.

Carol touches on the idea that love can be a difficult concept to grasp
and may cause confusion to those who aren't certain about their
sexuality. It's a great topic to look into; if only certain points of
the movie were more subtle about it than having Mara's character try to
beat around the bush asking her almost boyfriend if he's ever loved a
boy.We begin by seeing Therese and Carol talking in a lobby when Therese is
spotted by an old friend who asks her if she is attending a party.
Therese goes with the friend while reflecting on Carol, sending us into
the past to the events right before Therese and Carol meet. When
Therese spots Carol for the first time in the store where she works, it
seems very similar to the notion of the male gaze often found in
narrative cinema. There is a clear interest in the figure before
Therese gets distracted, but they of course meet a few moments later.
They aren't necessarily flirting, but they are two people with a
connection, and perhaps that's what love is - as long as the connection
is strong enough.Kyle Chandler as Carol's husband Harge (his name is Harge?) is the
closest thing to an antagonist in this film, and this role is somewhat
strange. At first it seems that he feels Carol is evil because she is a
lesbian who won't come out and say it, but you have to put into context
that he's the father of her child, and by seeing other people (women or
not) she is damaging the relationship she has with her husband, a
relationship that would affect the child. What seems to be overly
dramatic is the fact that he doesn't think she is fit to have joint
custody simply due to these lies she is trying to cover up. Carol is a
struggling lesbian in a time well before anybody like her would be
accepted, and because of this she has to be condemned? This film is
partially about the struggles of the LGBT community, but that
allegation seems too dramatic considering the actual circumstances
within the film.This film is definitely well-acted by both Mara and Blanchett. Both
leads have their own internal struggles with who they are and what love
really means. Mara's playing her character as shy and fragile is top
notch while Blanchett shines as being confident but overwhelmed and
sometimes heart-broken by the results of her actions. If you don't mind
sex, Carol is not really that heavy with "bad" content for an R- rated
movie. This film is easy to watch and explores great issues, but at
certain points comes across as cheesy or tries too hard to be dramatic.3.0/4.0

CAROL (2015) ***1/2 Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Kyle Chandler, Sara
Paulson, Jake Lacy, Cory Michael Smith. Excellent adaptation of
Patricia Highsmith's novel "The Price of Salt"with Blanchett (superbly
sublime) as the titular character who finds herself falling in love
with a department stork clerk (Mara equally en pointe) awakening a new
chapter in both their lives which lead to further complications
domestically (a divorced husband and wanna-be-husband for each to
contend with). Set in the 1950s with impeccable production design by
Judy Becker, glowing cinematography by Edward Lachman and expert
direction by Todd Haynes (Phyllis Nagy's screenplay adaptation is
remarkably clear-eyed and poignant) the film is buoyed by the exquisite
acting and fantastic production values overall.

There's an essay to be written about the touching of shoulders in this
film. I counted at least six occasions of a hand squeezing a shoulder.
Sometimes innocently, sometimes desperately. Sometimes with a meaning,
sometimes without. Sometimes passionately, sometimes not. Sometimes so
significantly, it's shown twice in the movie.The shoulder touching is just a detail. But this is a film in which
details are important. It's not just the shoulder touching. It's also
the dry-Martini-ordering, the shedding of tears, the clothing, the
hairdo's, the answering of phone calls, and I could go on. This is not
a film with spectacular plot twists, or breathtaking action scenes.
It's subtle gestures, and understated acting that make this a wonderful
film.In fact, the only major plot element there is - the private detective -
seems poorly explained. But that doesn't matter. This film is about
emotions - about a forbidden lesbian love affair in the early fifties,
to be exact, and about what that does to people.The beautiful cinematography, showing the elegance of the early fifties
in all its splendour, is a joy to watch. Just seeing two elegantly
dressed and headscarved women driving along in an open 1950 Packard,
regardless of the cold weather in December, is a beautiful sight.The same goes for the acting of Cate Blanchett, as the cool, debonair
femme fatale, and Rooney Mara as the young, innocent ingénue. Both give
strong, restrained performances, in perfect accordance with the
formality of the fifties.

So far I've seen this film 3 times in the theater. Each time I discover
something new. Not only are the performances exquisite, but so is the
cinematography, the score, the direction...simply everything. It's a
subtle film, but with each passing frame your swept into the story of
attraction played out mostly through rich subtext. Blanchette and Mara are perfectly cast and it's a marvel to watch their
characters transform through the course of the film. What's also
marvelous is the way in which the perspective changes along with the
each character's journey.Todd Haynes deserves much praise for his vision and deft hand with a
love story that will move you and linger long after the credits fade.

So many people have reviewed this movie without any knowledge of the
times, the writer, the book and, I have to note, what it was to be
homosexual in an era that could see you end up involuntarily committed
and having electro-convulsive therapy. To this I say, yes, it is slow
at many points but if you go to watch it knowing that it is 1950-52,
you also know that McCarthyism is ruling the land on 'subversion' and
it can be no other way. The slow burn is exactly what I expected. If
you go to watch it with this in mind, you will not be disappointed.Many reviewers have called Carol a predator and that there was nothing
in the meeting in the store other than Carol getting what she wanted.
So you just casually met your partners did you and weren't attracted to
them until they did something extraordinary for you?? They both saw
each other and wanted each other. At no time did I feel Carol was a
predator. I thought they were both getting exactly what they wanted.Some reviewers have criticised the happy ending as such a thing would
not have happened in the 1950s. Once again, I feel that these reviewers
are only showing their ignorance of homosexuality and history. Books of
the time did not have happy endings because society didn't accept that
there could be happy endings. In real life there were many happy
endings. The book was a seminal piece by Patricia Highsmith, for many
reasons, but it was the first lesbian novel to have a happy ending. I
am both elated, that I got to feel first hand what it would have been
like back then, but grateful that I was born in a more accepting time.The movie was slow, this I can't deny, but taken in context, based on a
book written in the times the movie portrays, the movie was stunning.
Another reviewer in here said that they rate a movie on how much they
think about it later. I have to agree.

Carol (2015) is good, but it's frustrating. Everything in it is about
distance, and this distance, it's not bright, charged, and incendiary,
but rather dull, lifeless and corrosive.The attraction between the two women, Therese and Carol, it's meant to
be foreign and impenetrable. As viewers, we are kept at an arm's length
at all times. All the shots in this movie are chosen to establish that
feeling of distance. Look at how many shots there are of windows in
this movie. We're made to be voyeurs, consumers. Both of these women,
too, they want, they desire, but are they much more than their
desperate instincts? Ham in the glass display case, camera through the
shop window, face through the car window, the door window; everywhere,
there are windows, and reflections, and images bouncing and fracturing
through these see-through prisons.When there are close ups of these characters, they are inaccessible,
chopped up, cut off from being whole. Carol's sumptuousness, it's all
artifice, and we're not allowed to glimpse who she is at all. She's
like a 17th c Dutch still life, the image is there but the subject
isn't; you can't touch, feel, smell anything, it's all for show. Then
there's Therese's wide-eyed stare, like a machine. A camera herself for
most of the movie, she's hungry, invasive yet aloof.The most sincere moment in the movie is in the visual sequence of
Therese and Carol driving through a tunnel to New Jersey, the frenetic
lights collapsing onto their faces through the car windows. As shots
are spliced together disconnectedly, infatuation come alive on screen,
and the two women delve deeper into something incomprehensible,
something close to love. Once they are through, they'll never be the
same again. We are closest to them during that sequence.That was the highlight of the movie for me. During the rest of the
movie, these ladies, they're busy filling the deep, black abyss in
their lives with desire. The whole movies smells like despair. I
suppose it captures the stifling impossibility of sapphic love in the
1950s.Poor babies. Go forth and be happy.

Carol is an elegant creation, an honest examination of the difficulties
of love, the most endearing of all human emotions. Movies about love
abound, of course, but few manage to engage the subject with integrity,
often resorting to absurd premises, ridiculous plot twists or more
often than not, unreasonable melodrama. Carol approaches the subject
with caring attention to the authentic and detailed vagaries of human
emotion without resort to diversions that subtract from hard truths.Todd Haynes's film concerns the early 1950s attraction between a
middle-aged New York woman, Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), pursuing a
divorce from her businessman husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler) and a
younger, shy department store saleswoman, Therese Belivet (Rooney
Mara). Harge still loves Carol, and is dismayed by her recent affair
with a third woman, Carol's friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) and by Carol's
lost affections for him. The situation is further complicated by the
fact that Carol and Harge have a little girl, Rindy, whom they both
obviously love very much, and by the fact that Therese has strung along
a young man, Richard (Jake Lacy), who loves her. Carol and Therese feel
an initial attraction when Carol seeks a Christmas gift for Rindy in
Therese's department. After Carol intentionally forgets her gloves on
the store counter for Therese to return, the interactions between them
become more frequent, leading to deeper attraction, and with that,
difficulties with the men involved in the situation. The key plot accelerator involves Carol's determination not to
accompany Harge to his family's home for Christmas activities. When
Harge takes Rindy to these festivities while Carol refuses to go, Carol
then invites a willing Therese to drive west with her to find some
freedom along the road, and to explore the depths of their feelings for
one another. Events that occur on this trip drive the eventual
decisions by the four individuals involved, all of which are presented
honestly by Haynes and writer Phyllis Nagy, who has adapted the
screenplay from Patricia Highsmith's novel The Price of Salt. The film
attends respectfully to the confusion, the sense of rejection and the
sadness of the key male characters - and both Chandler and Lacy express
the pain with a proper balance of conflicting emotions. Their anger is
evident, but restrained. However, the film never loses its primary
focus; this is the story of Carol and Therese, who captivate us in
every scene in which they are together.Blanchett and Mara are terrific in developing the relationship in a
suitably restrained fashion, true to their differences in age,
personality and circumstances, yet also true to their hearts. Blanchett
is the seemingly more confident and assured as the older woman, but
conveys her insecurities and doubts in unobtrusive ways, sparing us the
falseness of on-screen breakdowns. Her inner conflict between pursuing
the adult love of which she feels increasingly less trepidation and the
realization of a diminished relationship with her daughter is
profoundly present to all viewers, but the tension is not unduly
examined by either Haynes or Blanchett. Blanchett is at the top of her
formidable creative powers throughout this film, consistently true and
balanced and engaging. Mara is extremely convincing as the young woman
who, while seemingly not entirely sure of herself, is nonetheless
determined to chart her own path, whether that involves love that is
true to her nature, or pursuit of her artistic and professional goals.
She grows on the screen as the film progresses without losing her
fundamental personality. This is not a transformation, but rather a
more halting and careful self-realization and fulfillment for a woman
asserting control of her existence. The costuming and set designs are marvelous evocations of postwar New
York, but unlike Haynes's Far From Heaven, the use of the brighter
palette is not excessive, and the colors are not over-saturated or
insistent. Ed Lachman's cinematography complements the sets and
costumes beautifully, while also effectively capturing the constraints
on homosexuality in early '50s America. Conversations are in tight
frame, and the lighting is fittingly medium wattage but not dim. This
is a respectable love, after all, conducted discretely but not in the
shadows. Windows are effectively used to depict the
look-but-don't-touch sexual mores of the time, and the possibility of
love lost, and reflections help reveal truth of character and identity
- but these symbols are not overused.The film is well-paced, with relatively short scenes that both convey
emotional weight and move the plot without being either overwrought or
rushed. The score, by Carter Burwell, provides the appropriate balance
between emotional gravity, social tension and the hopefulness of love. Carol is a film that fires on all cylinders. It thoughtfully uses all
the tools of classic cinema to present interesting and realistic human
characters in difficult emotional situations, framed by significant
social strictures. The entire cast and crew, led by director Todd
Haynes, has gifted us with a film that will stand the test of time
despite Oscar snubs for the movie and its director. It is as genuine
and beautiful a love story as I, for one, have seen.

"Carol" is a beautiful love story, shot in old-fashioned melodramatic
style, notably thanks to the 16mm film texture. True, as some critics
have highlighted, it partly relies on "lesbian aesthetics", which is an
easy solution especially with two handsome actresses (each in their
own, different way). Yet even in "heterosexual films" actors frequently
look attractive, so we cannot specifically blame this movie.It is difficult to demonstrate the qualities of the movie because
everything is so nuanced. Indescribable ways to look at each other,
certain tones, simple replicas, even silences: emotion subtly arises as
sometimes in real life. Non-verbal elements are more important than
plot and dialogues. One striking example is the start of the love
scene, where Carol intensely looks at Therese in the mirror, chastely
unties her bathrobe belt without a word and then stands still: minimal
action, stunning effect.Todd Haynes was apparently inspired by the work of Ruth Orkin and
Morris Engel in the 1950s, however the movie also reminded me of
Douglas Sirk, the master of melodrama. And precisely it is difficult to
defend Sirk: plots are generally plain, dialogues apparently naive,
characters mostly caricatures yet his movies are masterpieces because
of his unique, grandiose style. Granted, "Carol" does not fully reach
Sirk's level, although it comes close.*** WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS ***The two main characters are struggling with life: Carol is in the
middle of an ugly divorce, Therese is searching for her identity,
notably sexually. Interestingly, she regrets agreeing to everything but
actually turns down all of her boyfriend's proposals and rejects the
boy kissing her. She only says "yes" to Carol which demonstrates her
attraction to her, even if she is not fully aware of it yet.Very efficiently, Haynes illustrates these struggles by confusing the
image. The two women are frequently seen behind windows with
reflections or rain drops. They are lost in the crowd and noise,
notably in the department store; in the street, passers-by hide the
main scene (for instance Carol in Abby's car). The long shot on the
gorgeous photo of Carol sleeping is seen through moving liquid.
Significantly, the start of the important love scene is seen in a
mirror. Sometimes, a sound occurs before the related shot: for instance
we hear a phone ringing at the end of shot 1, then we move to shot 2 in
a completely different place where someone picks up the phone.As spectators, we are confused, like the characters, by these mixes of
images and sounds. However, as soon as the two women start to live
their love, scenes are more relaxed, simply shot full frame without all
this agitation before the movie moves into the abject plot of the
divorce. (To those who think that the taped hotel scene is incredible:
this happened to Patricia Highsmith's female lover, whose story partly
inspired the book the movie is based on.) Only at the end will we find
quietness again.Carol's character is complex: fragile and strong, mother and lover,
classy and sensuous, delicate and harsh, frank and secretive,
intelligent and clumsy. She faces a tough dilemma between family and
love. It is a perfect role for Cate Blanchett. We easily understand why
Therese is attracted to her from the beginning.Therese's character is also interesting: while Carol is at crossroads,
her path is more linear. We see her progress from curiosity to
friendship, then to intimacy, then to love. Her personality also
evolves, from an almost teenage girl without friends and desires, stuck
with a simple boyfriend, to eventually a resolute lady (when she looks
like Audrey Hepburn, which adds to the old-fashioned style). Rooney
Mara is a revelation. However regarding this metamorphosis, I think the
movie has one flaw: it starts at the end, so we see Therese already
transformed by her experience; then there is a long flashback, before
we come back to the ending. Probably the transformation would have been
more compelling with a straightforward chronology.Another small downside is the lack of social context: apart from the
husband and the divorce procedure, we do not witness despise towards
homosexuality, which was omnipresent at the time, even in New York. At
no point do we see people looking angry or insulting the two women.
Also, some themes might have been explored more thoroughly, for
instance the age and/or social difference between the lovers.These minor drawbacks excepted, "Carol" stands out as a reference in
what we could name "historical homosexual genre", to simplify. It is
clever, intriguing, charming, sensual. It also is pleasing that the
movie ends well, unlike many homosexual movies unfortunately (they
frequently end up in separation, exile, depression, injury and/or
death). Still, just like Therese says love is unexplainable like
chemistry, many qualities of the movie (as Therese's photos) remain
somewhat of a mystery, and maybe all the better so.

(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: A film so sensitive and emotionally satisfying with wonderful
direction and superb production values.GRADE: A-The lesbian romance film, Carol, shows the world as it was, brimming
with homophobia and societal proprieties. It grips the moviegoer from
the start, with a scene that bookends its narrative and does a complete
180 degrees in its brilliant use of flashback. This is one of director
Todd Haynes' finest films, one that should not be missed. (That this
film did not merit an Oscar nomination for its director and the film
itself is a travesty.) ￼It's the Fifties, 1952 to be exact, a time when love could only be
seen between the opposite sex and repression was the ultimate means of
survival. Carol tells its tale so well, with a sensitivity toward its
subject and a stylish flair that shies away from the full-blown soap
opera aspects of the story: Two women share a secret passionate
relationship and the complications they faced in the real world change
their lives. The film is staggering in its solitude and nuanced in its
superb acting by its two leads.Through a chance meeting, Therese (Rooney Mara), a saleswoman
encounters a new customer, Carol (Cate Blanchett). She is suddenly
quite taken by this beautiful socialite and the attraction is mutual
yet mysterious to both women. Carol lives alone but has a loving
boyfriend, Richard, while Carol is lost in an unhappy marriage to Harge
and devoted to her young child. Their lives entangle as their romance
begins to grow. But love, unfortunately, has its bounds.￼The artful vision of Todd Haynes crafts a film brimming with repressed
passion...a cautious look, a somewhat lingering touch, whispered
conversations. He fills the screen with images that evoke that era as
he focuses on the women caught in a man's world and the repercussions
that their affair will undermine. The melodramatic elements are still
there but everything is handled so subtly and honestly that one is
swept into the emotional dilemmas of the film's well-defined
characters. Both the director and Phyllis Nagy's screenplay, based on
Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel, The Price of Salt, downplay the
theatrics and bring a modernistic sensibility to this literate
adaptation.￼The acting is excellent. Ms. Blanchett, channeling the icy
sophistication of Grace Kelly, plays the title character and hides the
vulnerability and anger seething beneath the surface. Her heightened
composure, demure manner, and classic wardrobe serve to camouflage the
fear and hurt from years of perpetuating a lie that brought her wealth
and motherhood. Ms. Mara, resembling a young waif-like Audrey Hepburn,
shows her character's impetuousness and eagerness to confront her own
inhibitions in such a convincing way. Their chemistry is palpable and
each actress conveys the multitude of emotions that emerge from these
oppressed times. Fine support also comes from its fine cast: Sarah
Paulson, Cory Michael Smith, Jake Lacy, and especially Kyle Chandler as
Carol's brutish spouse.￼Special mentions go out to the artisans behind the camera as well: Ed
Lachman's camera-work captures a bygone era with his golden tones and
pastel palette, production design by Judy Becker hones in on the period
details, Sandy Powell's costumes bring that style and elegance to the
forefront, and Carter Burwell's lovely melancholy score adds layers to
the moody atmosphere of the film. ￼Carol is superior filmmaking and one of the year's best films.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com

A delicate touch from an adorned hand, its nail's awakened with red.
The longing gaze across a tonally somber department store, the whirl of
shoppers momentarily silenced. The aromatic embrace of a perfume that
lingers on a woman's top. A heavy silence that permeates the air
between phone lines, an "I miss you" lost between thoughts. These are
mere moments that make up Todd Haynes' (Far From Heaven) rapturously
gorgeous film, speaking softly to the love between two people without
actually uttering a single word. Early in our film, watching a movie
from the projection room, one of the character's friends states that he
is "plotting the correlation between what the characters say and what
they feel." In doing so, Carol intermittently begins separating the
actions and the voice, unfolding an exquisitely layered story right in
front of us. Evoking the times of the 50's with the contemporary
struggles of today, Carol is a meticulously crafted piece that
demonstrates the tight- rope balance between exhibition and expressive,
offering up a plethora of the intimate through visual storytelling.Set between the month before, and the months after 1952, Carol tells
the story of the love between two women from flutteringly different
places in life; one longing with ambition, the other discovering with
inhibition. Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) is a shop girl and aspiring
photographer stuck behind the counter of a toy store, the dolls behind
her looking outwardly with an empty gaze. Her desperate need to break
free is symbolized in a train set, its red caboose trailing behind with
an urgency to keep up. Carol Aird(Cate Blanchett) is an upper-class
mother on the tail end of a frayed marriage, less searching for love
than acceptingly absorbing it. Her leather gloves conceal her bedecked
hands, their diaphanous touch evoking an assured grace and desire
throughout the film. What begins quietly over martinis, soon blossoms
into a love that precariously balances on the edge. Amidst this
newfound desire, Carol finds herself caught up in a legal battle for
her daughter, while Therese fights to discover who she is.Director Todd Haynes, adapting Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel, The
Price of Salt, suffuses Carol with poignancy; deftly displaying what
love looks like rather than what it says. These are moments that are
accentuated by looks, of long gazes and understood emotion. What is
stated may become the obvious, as these powerfully hushed scenes exude
a sense of direction and containment that words can only add to.
However, Phyllis Nagy brings an eloquent and insightful approach to
Carol and Therese, carving two women with a honed manner that creates a
commandment when their voices crack the silence. There's a separation
to how Haynes' characters feel to what they say, giving a voice to
their demeanor, to their bodies that Highsmith was unable to fully
achieve in her novel. When Carol stares into a mirror at her
reflection, it's a quiet scene that is undercut with searching eyes and
sorrowful words. As Therese listens to the silence on the other end of
a telephone, cutting to Carol and back, we understand explicitly what
these two are saying. It's these images of two women, of love and acceptance that form the
words that are expressed, giving a depth to these characters that
embody so much of what pulsates within our own selves. Carol's husband
Harge (Kyle Chandler) expresses a pained love with bursts of rage
fueled by alcohol, while Therese's boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy)
expresses it with paper thin sincerity. The men in their lives
contradict their feelings with what they say, confusing anger with
passion, and necessity for desire. Both struggle to put one foot in
front of the other, aligning them with the societal structure for
marriage. It's a concept that drives both women away from them,
ultimately bringing the two together.Imbuing Carol with uncompromising beauty is costume designer Sandy
Powell, who earlier this year brought Cinderella from fantasy to
fantastic; working with Judy Becker and makeup artist Jodi Byrne to
bring the 1950's roaring back to life. From gold inlaid bangles to
extravagant fur coats and lush red lipstick, Powell, Byrne and Becker
help define the distinct separation between our character's lives. As
our story develops and our characters evolve, each begins exhibiting
tonal shifts that define the other; Therese's shade of lipstick becomes
brighter, while Carol's dulls to almost nothing. Powell and Byrne
utilize red in the same manner, subtly placing it at first to the side,
in a coat on a crowded street corner, working it through till it rests
on the lips of our characters. It's a symbolic gesture that is
reminiscent of the train-set Carol buys for her daughter, the red
caboose trailing behind. When Carol walks to her lawyer's office in
order to fight for custody of her daughter Rindy (sisters Sadie and Kk
Heim), it's her red coat that stands out amidst the grays and browns of
the street. During a road trip, Carol applies shades of opulent red to
Therese's lips, preening her with perfume and nail polish. It's this
idea of following, of chasing after something that resounds in all of
us, and of feeling lost in our own tiny world that comes out
extravagantly through the films impeccable art direction....Read more at www.reelbrew.tumblr.com

"Carol" is filled with moments, sometimes subtle, one has to feel, and
can feel. It's not just about the beautiful sight of romance in the
making. Director Todd Haynes allows us to experience what it really
felt like to fall in love with Carol (Cate Blanchett) and the sometimes
uncomfortableness of Therese (Rooney Mara) has with the unknowing
desire in her mind and heart.Therese encountered Carol for the first time while confined behind the
desk of the department store she worked. She couldn't take her glittery
eyes off her. Carol vanishes briefly then appears at the desk wanting a
certain doll for her daughter. Out-of-stock reasons leads to another
gift idea and exchanging of information for shipment purposes when
Carol leaves with a compliment and forgets her gloves, leaving Therese
to return them. While her boyfriend sleeps in the other room, Therese
toys with the idea of mailing them to her and eventually runs to the
mailbox in time for the morning pick up.That's all that was needed for a phone call with an invitation to lunch
for thanks. "A strange girl you are flung out of space," Carol says
during lunch after an invitation to her house followed by a "yes" from
Therese.From there, a relationship is born. A beautiful one in fact. There is
desire, an erotic nature and heartbreak. Sometimes, people can't always
have what they want when it's best for them. Timing is everything.
Nonetheless, a love between two people is fueled by the need for each
other."Carol" is gorgeously shot and immensely captures the culture, sounds
and colors of the 1950s. It was a very fashionable time filled with
wonderful jazz and one can immerse themselves in that time period
during the film. There are countless times when a beautiful window shot
would appear featuring Therese with the colors of streetlights
heightened by raindrops and fog.Cate Blanchett will make you fall for her regarding her performance.
She glowingly embodies confidence and seductiveness. She completely
awes while expressing what's best for her daughter in the mince of
being accused of wrong doing by having a relationship with another
woman.Rooney Mara, while sometimes mute, emotionally desired something
without knowing what exactly. It took meeting Carol to know exactly
what she needed. Mara is innocently brilliant. Sarah Paulson offered a
strong supporting role, as well.The many silent moments in the film allows one to capture and truly
feel how Carol and Therese felt for each other. People don't always
need to hear the words "I care about you" or "I love you." People need
and want to feel the desire for one another, and Haynes makes that
possible in "Carol."Check out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!

I am surprised by how much this movie was misunderstood by so many. A
love story at its core is timeless for all generations. How we had
denied others the right to fully love someone and care for your own
child in the eyes of the law. Carol gave up her share of custody (and
trade it with regular visits) only to avoid dragging her daughter into
their ugly embarrassing court process. How we were/are oblivious to how
gender play additional hardship on the LGBT women who must fight for
their place in the society. Music, gestures, and body languages spoke
in a way that words can never describe. A master piece, if you see this
film for what it is and fully realize what was there right in front of
you. An instant classic.

Let me say as prologue that Carol is one of those rare movies where
everything about it is in complete sync: acting, script, directing,
cinematography, even the musical score. I would conjecture this movie
stands a good chance of garnering a bunch of Oskars at the upcoming
2016 Academy Awards Ceremony. It certainly deserves them.In summary it's a woman-woman love story. But of course there's more to
it than that. And in the case of Carol, a lot more. Carol is a classy,
upper Manhattan socialite in her mid-40s who reeks elegance,
sophistication, perfume, and money. Lots of money. She is confident and
exciting. She is beautiful and she is seductive.It's Christmas time in the City. Silver Bells and all. City sidewalks
and department stores are jammed with shoppers anxious to get their
holiday shopping done. Carol (Cate Blanchett) is searching for a
special doll for her young daughter in one of those large Manhattan
department stores―the kind they had back in the 1950s with their
polished marble floors, elevators stacked with shoppers, and elegant
tea rooms. As she glances around, her eyes latch onto a young female
clerk standing behind the doll counter. Like all the store clerks, she
is wearing a large red stocking hat with a white ball on top and a
furry white rim. Just like Santa's. The clerk returns Carol's glance
with a look that says it all. I'm young. I'm hungry. Take me. Liberate
me from this drudge life. And Carol takes it. She moves closer. In for
the kill, so to speak. The doll in not in stock the clerk tells her.
How about a toy train set for your daughter? Carol orders it, giving
her name and address for delivery, and leaves. But not before
conveniently forgetting her gloves.The gloves are returned, and Carol calls the department store asking
for the clerk that returned them. Carol wants to thank her in person
and asks if she could meet her for lunch. They meet in a swank mid-town
restaurant. Full of confidence and not missing a beat Carol orders a
super-deluxe sandwich and a dry martini with an olive. The clerk,
nervous, orders the same thing. Carol asks her name. It's Therese
Belivet (Rooney Mara). Carol asks discreetly, "Therese? Not Theresa?"
Therese shakes her head shyly. No. Belivet is Czech, it turns out.
Czech means her parents, or grandparents, emigrated to the US, and were
probably blue-collar or small shopkeepers. She is as much in awe of
Carol's parentage as she is of her beauty and sophistication. Soon
Carol has Therese coming over to her large country house.What complicates Carol's seduction plan is her soon-to-be ex-husband,
Harge Aird (Kyle Chandler). It's clear from comments Harge wants Carol
to be the model executive's wife. Eye candy on his arm at the country
club and social get-togethers. A patient wife who can endure his
absences. But it's also clear Harge is still very much in love with
Carol. He knew Carol had a previous affair with another woman who was a
childhood friend, Abby Gerhard (Sarah Paulson). But he overlooked it.
And he wants Carol back. Wants their life together again with their
young daughter, Rindy (Sadie Heim/Kk Heim). And he doesn't understand
why she's so adamant to live her life separately. He's frustrated with
her, and his frustration boils over into anger and a desire for
revenge. If he cannot have Carol, he will prevent her from keeping
Rindy. But even in his uncomprehending frustration he doesn't strike
her. He doesn't understand. Carol is a cougar. She wants to take on
lovers. In her case young female lovers. And especially the one she has
just met: Therese Belivet.Therese drinks with her friends at bars. Goes to her friends parties.
Young people in their 20s struggling to establish their lives in an
unforgiving world and to find a suitable mate to go along with them.
But Therese is different. She wants more. She wants to abandon her
plodding life in the underclass and sample the life of high society.
Maybe even become a well-known and in-demand photographer. For this she
needs connections. And along comes Carol Aird who drops out of the blue
into her go-nowhere life like the good White Witch.The cougar and the kitten. Each has something to give and something to
take. Carol has beauty, money, sophistication, and connections in high
places. She will take Therese's love and admiration. Therese has youth
and a young willing body. She will take Carol's love and the promise of
a new lien on life. And maybe, just maybe, they will forge a stronger
bond between each other that will last a lifetime.In one of the most poignant scenes in the movie in front of Harge, his
attorney, and her attorney, Carol openly admits she has been a bad wife
to Harge and has not reciprocated his love. But she pleads with him not
to take their daughter away completely from her, for that would utterly
destroy Rindy. Harge caves in. Carol wins the right to see her daughter
but Rindy is to be left in Harge's custody. One can only wonder though
what effect her parents' separation will have on Rindy as she grows up.

Todd Haynes has made a career directing movies focusing on
transgressive and complex eroticism. His movies "Safe" and "Far from
Heaven" looked at suburban housewives whose seemingly ideal lives get
upended. He continues this tradition with "Carol", based on a book by
Patricia Highsmith.Cate Blanchett plays a 1950s affluent woman going through a divorce who
strikes up a relationship with a shopgirl played by Rooney Mara. Their
lives couldn't be more different: Blanchett's Carol is the embodiment
of 1950s glamor, while Mara's Therese lives in an apartment and is
still trying to make a go of it in photography. Sure enough, Carol's
husband uses the relationship against her in divorce proceedings.Like "Far from Heaven", "Carol" concentrates on the social
constrictions of the era. There's something hidden behind the facade of
the classy, stylish worlds that the protagonists of both movies
inhabit. The supposedly happy wives see their comfortable lifestyles
fall apart. Their only path to any further joy is a relationship that
was taboo in the 1950s.This has to be one of the year's best movies. I've liked every Todd
Haynes movie that I've seen (another one is the Bob Dylan-themed "I'm
Not There"). I hope that he continues making these sorts of movies, and
I hope that this movie receives some Oscar nods. Everything about it is
perfect.

This is an absolutely wonderful film, which features some incredible
directing and acting as well as a generally compelling plot that
manages to avoid all of your expectations and provide a story that's
really quite different.In effect, the plot is about the romance between two women, and how, in
the 1950s, that could go down so badly amongst society, but where this
film's genius lies is in its ability to show this story not in the
normal 'taboo' way, but actually just as a standard romance, where it's
the main characters' love that is strongest instead of the ways in
which society views them.As a result, you get a wonderful love story right the way through, but
it's still not one without high drama. The inner conflict of Rooney
Mara's young character is fascinating to watch, whilst Cate Blanchett's
character engages in a fierce legal battle with her husband throughout,
adding an extra level of emotional intrigue, and preventing this from
becoming too much of a run-of-the-mill romantic drama.In general, you get an absolutely fascinating plot with this film, and
although you could say that the opening phase is a little bit sluggish
in establishing the characters and the main romance (although the
general pace of the whole film is very patient), it's easy to get
really engrossed in this story.Beyond the plot, the performances here are very strong too. Rooney Mara
is excellent in the role of a young woman finding herself overcome with
unexpected emotions, but it's still Cate Blanchett that steals the
show. Although Mara plays the main character, Blanchett's presentation
of Carol, the older, sophisticated woman, is pretty astonishing.You can tell with this performance that she's an actress right at the
top of her game, because every time she appears in any scene, she
completely dominates, showing off all her amazing talent to the full,
and although this arguably isn't as clearly impressive a performance as
Blue Jasmine, the way she turns Carol into this illusive woman who so
easily becomes the object of the younger woman's affection, is
fantastic.Finally, it has to be said that this is one of the most aesthetically
pleasing film you'll see all year. Todd Haynes' direction is fabulous,
and, along with the beautiful costume and production design, he does
such an excellent job of creating this cosy world in 1950s New York
that makes this such a pleasant story, as well as taking some
interesting choices over the cinematography. It seems that in most
scenes, all the characters appear very neatly off-centre, which is just
a small touch, but brilliant attention to detail, that got to me and
made me love looking at this beautiful film even more.

Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. He thought the
ending was weird but we were both quiet during the entire movie with
him breathing during some of the emotional scenes. I'm thinking he
might be having this one on his mind for a while. It's certainly worth
doing so and it's such a compelling drama of the social and sexual
mores of the time it's set in. Both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara do
fine in their roles and I really liked the way their characters
interacted with each other. I also liked the performances of Kyle
Chandler and Sarah Paulson in the roles they did, having been fans of
their work for TV and other films. So on that note, I highly recommend
Carol as the exploration of what it was like then compared to now.

The best romantic movie of 2015. The movie is not just a LGBT movie its
much more. While other LGBT movies feel like they are trying to make a
point, this does not. Its just a romantic movie involving 2 Lesbians in
50's not the other way around. A good movie with great acting. A simple
story with with simple dialogue elevated by great performances from the
leads. There is great chemistry between them. Rooney Mara is just
brilliant. She portrays the thoughts and feelings of her character
without even speaking. The director seems to have taken advantage of
this, you can see him having her in the focused and show her reaction
even when Cate's speaking.

The film Carol is lovely, and wonderfully directed. Cate Blanchett and
Rooney Mara's performances are stunning. I love the subtleties in the
facial expressions, eyes gazing and gestures, the silent and subtle
interactions between the character of Carol and Therese. The film
captures the essence of falling in love. It is a wonderful love story.
It is difficult to write a review about this film without repeating
what has been written already. There are so many excellent praises on
this film and I agree to all of them. I have read the novel "The Price
of Salt" that this film was based on. It is a good book, well written,
like poetry. Phyllis Nagy did an excellent job on the screenplay for
this filmKudos to her. I read that it took a long time to make this
movie, because of money, production, and so on. I'm glad no one gave up
on it and it was made. Thank you, to all the cast and crew for making
this film. It moved me. A must see!

Rooney Mara plays Therese a department store worker who encounters
carol played by Cate Blanchett and their lives are forever changed
during their encounter. Therese starts to fall in love with carol
despite being involved with Richard even though he is more of a friend
than actual boyfriend. Meanwhile carol is going through a struggle of
her own while dealing with the divorce of her husband while also having
to worry about a custody battle of her daughter as well, what made this
movie rather touching for me was how Therese started to come out of her
shell and open up while carol gains confidence in herself. What makes
it even more powerful is the advertisy that the ladies faced and
managed to come out strong.

A great film, technically... The emotional connection between Carol and
Therese is a little obscure...Love at first sight at the store? I am not a fan of this, or just the
loneliness of each other?The description of discrimination on LGBT is also kind of
insufficient..Anyway.. due to the great performance, charm? or face? of Cate
Blanchett and Rooney Mara, it just get 8+ hands down.It must be Cate Blanchett... The scene in the restaurant when Carol was asking Therese for launch,
it reminds me of how Scarlett Johansson flirting with a man in Match
Point.

After about a third of the way through this fine film I became so
distracted by Roona Mara's striking resemblance to the late Jean
Simmons (at roughly the age Mara is now) that it was difficult to
remain focused on the film itself. The good thing is that the Simmons'
performances date from her debut in the early forties and into the
fifties so you'd need to be 1) seriously senior or 2) a devotee of
vintage CDs and/or a member of a Film Society specialising in the
period to spot the likeness and there's a good chance that even Mara
herself is unaware of the likeness. That aside this is, of course, yet
another tour de force by the exceptional actress Cate Blanchett who
here receives, it must be acknowledged, outstanding support by both
Mara and Susan Paulson as Abby. Clearly director Haynes was aiming for
a Checkovian feel and the fact that he was one dacha short is neither
here nor there and it still remains a film of nuances rather than
dramatic moments.

The seduction and hypnosis of a Todd Haynes film is hard to deny. His
attention to detail in such films like "Far from Heaven" and "I'm Not
There" are simply superb, and one cannot overlook the vision he engulfs
upon as he directs each one of them. In his newest venture, "Carol,"
which is based on the book "The Price of Salt" by Patricia Highsmith,
the luxurious command in which he approaches the material is confident
and pristinely evident once again. He pulls out some outstanding
performances, especially from Cate Blanchett and Sarah Paulson, and
crafts another multi-layered deconstruction on love during a time where
it was simply one note to modern society. With all that said, there's a
barrier between the film's central characters and its audience,
resulting in a good, not great cinematic endeavor."Carol" tells the story of Therese (pronounced TER-REZ and played by
Rooney Mara), a department store clerk who dreams of a better life
outside the normalcy of work and her persistent beau Richard (played by
Jake Lacy). Set in 1950s New York, she falls for an older, married
woman names Carol (played by Blanchett), and the two embark on a
journey of forbidden love."Carol" is as lusciously made as you come to expect from any Haynes
film. Sexy, sultry, and vibrantly crafted, Haynes pours his heart and
soul into each frame he directs with generous and respectful
admiration. He transports us to a time we can only see in our dreams,
with stunning cloths of the 1950's, thanks to outstanding Sandy Powell,
and gorgeous set design, thanks to Judy Becker and Heather Loeffler.The script by Phyllis Nagy, whose only credit is the TV Movie "Mrs.
Harris," which she also directed and was nominated for an Emmy, is
profound in parts. It's natural to go back to something like "Brokeback
Mountain" for comparison, a story that succeeded so much on the subtle
and quietly spoken thoughts of its characters. We see their love
present in a secret kiss on the side of an apartment, or on a quiet
standing by a camp fire as Ennis goes to take care of the caddle for
the night. These are factors that add to up a forbidden love.In "Carol," there's a missing variable in Carol and Therese's
relationship. They meet, flirt awkwardly, and then suddenly are
together in a strange circumstance. Now, one can argue that love knows
no boundaries of time nor space. Perhaps you would be correct in that,
but the main difference between Ennis and Jack versus Carol and
Therese, is that the love in the former felt just as high-stakes at
what they threatened to lose. Ennis loses his family, wanders the Earth
essentially, still unsure of his own place, even without theoretically
any more obstacles. Yet, Jack visits him upon the news of his impending
divorce, and with still a real fear of exile and being true to himself,
Ennis sends him away. Jack is heartbroken by this behavior, that
translates well into one of the most iconic lines, "I wish I knew how
to quit you."Carol feels like Ennis in this regard, destined to live alone despite
embracing her own sensibilities and self. However , in Therese's young,
unconfident mind, she doesn't equal or amount to the yin, of Carol's
yang. Her exploration comes off like curiosity rather than love.
Perhaps that's the intent, and if it is, then I applaud it, but when
the film reaches its conclusion, nothing supports that claim. I find
little reason to root for these two to be together. "Blue is the
Warmest Color," even with intense and ill-fitting explicit scenes,
manages to show the passion between the two main characters. I think
that's the key word that's missing from the film: passion.With those hurdles, some of the performances surpass any and all
expectations. With a stellar year in hand with James Vanderbilt's
"Truth" already loved by so many, Cate Blanchett delivers an even more
breathtaking portrayal in Haynes' film. Blanchett captures the lioness
quality of Carol, steaming forward with blinders on as she finds
herself entranced by Therese's innocence. Her slow, sultry hand moving
across her lover's shoulder is a vibrant action that speaks impeccable
volumes. I thought it was one of her best performances ever.Rooney Mara's sensitive yet disengaged nature from her surroundings is
particularly moving as she walks through the film. Her quiet breakdowns
are felt in the moment but have no lasting effect for the rest of the
story. With such strong Supporting Actress buzz for the performance,
I'm a little baffled by its unanimous love fest. Especially when
standing next to the great Sarah Paulson, whose role and performance
will hawk back to Patricia Clarkson in "Far from Heaven" but with such
depth and assurance. Not exactly developed to its full potential, but
as Abby, Carol's best friend and former flame, Paulson engages it all
with a vigorous and palpable energy. As Carol's husband Harge, Kyle
Chandler's desperation and urgency is lively and vivid, but with not
enough substance and time to really make an impact."Carol" is fruitful in the cinematic capacity of its structure but it
leaves some things to be desired. For a Haynes enthusiast, they'll
likely run the gauntlet on its construction and performances, eating
every morsel of it up with a spoon. For others, the appreciation will
surely be clear, but there may be some that are left out in the cold.

Earlier this year, in my review of "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"
specifically, and again in "Paper Towns," I remarked about how a new
trend in films was beginning to seriously bother me. That trend was the
main character of the film, usually a male teen, remarking about how
his story "wasn't your typical romance" story or something along those
lines. That ploy is such a cheap case of showing rather than telling,
or pompously telling the audience something that we would've figured at
had we watched the film from start to finish. Perhaps it's only fitting
to wrap up 2015's movie-going year with Todd Haynes's "Carol," and,
again, point another device in films that's becoming a cliché that I'm
getting tired of, as well.That cliché is the long, lingering shots of facial expressions set to
pretty obvious orchestration music. It's a device that's purpose is to
ostensibly avoid emotional manipulation and provide for simultaneous
abstraction of internal thoughts whilst embellishing external reactions
and expressions. Some films do it in a way that provokes a lot of
thought and naturalism - see "Christmas, Again" or even "Creed" for a
more mainstream example. "Carol," a film that's ultimately a fine work
of lesbian cinema, especially by America's standards, is a film that
uses it in a way that disconnects from the humanity of the characters
in a way that becomes noticeable over the film's two hour runtime.The film is set in the 1950's and revolves around Carol Aird (Cate
Blanchett), a woman in the process of divorcing her husband Harge (Kyle
Chandler) and enduring a custody battle for her young daughter. One
day, Carol looks to purchase a Christmas present for her daughter, and
at the department store, she meets Therese Belivet (pronounced
"ther-rezz," played by Rooney Mara), a shopgirl who is working there in
the meantime to fund her dreams of being a photographer. Carol winds up
leaving her gloves on the counter after a brief and amiable
conversation with Therese, assuring Therese that this isn't the last
time the two will meet.Sure enough, it's not, and the two wind up meeting again. And again.
They meet enough to conjure up suspicious on behalf of Harge, who sees
their friendship as one that's quickly brewing into a very questionable
relationship. We, the audience, see Carol and Therese for who they
really are - two women, separated by several years in age, caught in
precarious situations that are preventing them from the life they want
to lead. Carol's albatross is obviously the prolonged legal proceedings
and Harge's demanding and often drunken demeanor, while Therese's is
simply the angst of being young and without many opportunities of
creativity in a world where expression is limited and money is tight.
The two wind up leaning on one another for some semblance of order and
stability and, in turn, produce a relationship that is both friendly
and respectfully sexual."Carol" is a beautifully crafted and well-acted film; the sets and
details of the 1950's vehicles, costumes, and malt shops are some of
the strongest period sets of the year, sure to snag an Oscar nomination
come January. This is also a performance that rests on the strengths of
Blanchett, one of the finest female actresses working today, and Mara,
who proves that she can hold her own weight, yet again, with a
character that isn't so easily defined. Put in frame together, these
two actresses, one a veteran and the other well on her way to becoming
one, create terrific energy in nearly every scene."Carol," however, ultimately suffers by comparison to "Blue is the
Warmest Color," the acclaimed French film that won the Palme d'Or a few
years back. That was a film that was raw and real, built from the
ground up on human emotions and awkward conversations about
relationships and the state of ones feelings. Far too often does Todd
Haynes's film and Phyllis Nagy's screenplay settle for abstraction of
feelings and lack of character development by trying too hard to create
visual poetry by way of Blanchett and Mara's facial expressions, most
of which looking uniformly similar throughout the course of the film.When "Carol" really pops is during its climax, no pun intended, when
the effects of Carol and Therese's relationship begins to become
unraveled. Also a really wonderful addition is Nagy's look at how, in a
relationship, often one person is incredibly affected by the events,
while another is able to move on so easily and not look back. That
subtle examination is also what sets "Carol" apart from an ordinary
romance film, especially one as bleak as this.Haynes and Nagy have crafted a gentle and fairly tame film as far as
lesbian films go, which is totally fine; being graphic doesn't mean
better, but it often does add a rawer, more unadulterated angle to the
film. "Carol," however, plays it safe far too many times to be a fully
commendable film; it lacks the kind of character development and real
conversational depth it needs to be more than a momentary look into a
star-crossed relationship.

I saw the review for this on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny
Leigh, it got great praise and was chosen as "film of the week", it
certainly sounded like something I would enjoy, so I went to the cinema
with great anticipation, directed by Todd Haynes (Safe, Far from
Heaven). Basically set in the early 1950s, temporary shop girl Therese
Belivet (Rooney Mara) is working in a Manhattan department store in the
toy department during the Christmas season. She is approached by older
woman Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), who from There's recommendation
purchases a train set as a gift for her daughter, Carol accidentally
leaves her gloves behind on the counter, so Therese mails them to her
home in New Jersey. Carol meanwhile is going through a difficult
divorce with neglectful husband Harge (Super 8's Kyle Chandler), and
struggling to maintain custody of daughter Rindy (twins Sadie and Kk
Heim). Having had her gloves returned, feeling lonely and wanting to
show her gratitude, Carol invites Therese to lunch, she also invites
her to her home for Christmas, they strike up a friendship. Therese
aspires to be a photograph, and takes several pictures of Carol from a
distance as she buys a Christmas tree, Harge is suspicious of his
wife's relationship with Therese, as years ago she and her best friend
Abby Gerhard (Sarah Paulson) had a fling, he goes on a business trip to
Florida, taking Rindy with him. Carol and Therese also invoke anger
from Therese'e boyfriend Richard Semco (Jake Lacy) as their friendship
continues to grow, she does not love him, and he admitted to sleeping
with two other women during their relationship, they break up, he tells
Therese that Carol will be rid of her soon. To escape the stress of the
break up and the divorce, Carol and Therese decide to take a road trip
together to Chicago, Carol gives a new camera and film to Therese as a
gift. On New York's Eve, Carol and Therese finally acknowledge their
strong romantic feelings for each other, making love for the first time
in their motel room. During their trip they met Tommy Tucker (Cory
Michael Smith) who was a masquerading as a salesman, in fact he is a
private investigator hired by Harge to follow them and record evidence
of their affair. The audio tapes have already been sent to Harge, and
will be used against Carol in the custody hearings for Rindy, Carol
suddenly leaves for New York to fight for her daughter, Therese tries
calling her, but Carol hangs up, realising she cannot continue their
relationship if she wants any chance of seeing her daughter again.
Evidence against Carol is too incriminating, she tearfully allows Harge
to have full custody of Rindy, but begs for visitation rights,
threatening to take the matter to court if he refuses. Therese
meanwhile over a few months, with the help of writer friend Dannie
McElroy (John Magaro), becomes a photographer for The New York Times,
and admires the photos of Carol she took during their time together.
Therese and Carol finally reconnect at the Ritz-Carlton, Carol telling
that she works at a furniture store and is allowed to visit Rindy twice
a month, the divorce has settled and Carol invites Therese to live with
her in her apartment, but Therese refuses, still upset by her previous
rejection. Therese accepts a party invitation with Richard later that
same night, but finds she cannot socially connect with any of the
guests, Therese leaves and goes to the restaurant where Carol is, as
she approaches and the two smile warmly seeing each other. Also
starring Carrie Brownstein as Genevieve Cantrell, Kevin Crowley as Fred
Haymes and Nik Pajic as Phil McElroy. Blanchett as usual gives a great
performance as the older alluring woman trapped in and ending a
loveless marriage, Mara has had a varied career, but here proves a
fantastic choice as the naive shop clerk, the two are perfectly matched
as the lesbian lovers, it is a simple story of forbidden love in a time
where being gay was controversial, the film cleverly balances emotional
melodrama and tenderness between characters, and the recreated 1950s
backgrounds and costumes are beautifully accurate, an intelligent,
atmospheric and must see romantic drama. Very good!

Period piece director Todd Hayes ("Far From Heaven" - 2002, "Velvet
Goldmine" - 1998) ventures back once again, this time to tell the story
of 1950's forbidden lesbian love, based on Patricia Highsmith's novel
"The Price of Salt". With Cate Blanchett (Carol) and Rooney Mara
(Therese) stepping outside of their perceived non-gay comfort zones,
this film is all the buzz. However, while Haye's perfectly captures the
era in question with the use of antique film quality, and filling the
environment with vintage cars, costumes, props and music, Phyllis
Nagy's (dir./writer "Mrs. Harris"- 2005) slow moving screenplay, filled
primarily with glances and glares, hinders any desire to stay with the
love affair. Kyle Chandler ("Friday Night Lights"), Sarah Paulson
("American Horror Story) and Jake Lacey ("Better with You" - 2010)
graciously fill in the gals respective angushied backstory, however,
you are a better person than I if you find worth in this 118 minutes
snooze fest.

Here's a slow movie with extremely grainy cinematography and an
overbearing score, all the elements of a great foreign film. Too bad
it's not foreign and it's in English so those elements are just
distracting.Rooney Mara is outstanding and will get award consideration in the
supporting actress category. Some will be fooled by the restrained play
with my hair performance by Producer Kate Blanchett that was too subtle
especially in regard to loosing custody of her child.The music is interesting, except when it was loud to cover underwritten
dialogue. If it's not meant to be heard, don't write it. A gun turns
this drama into melodrama for a minute. But why did she have it?No need to see this on the big screen. It will play well on a home
platform.

Mara plays Therese who falls in love with a much older woman played by
Blanchet in 1950s New York. From the onset, the film appears to be
crippled as it barely gains speed during the first and second act.
Blanchet's acting felt laboured throughout and Mara fared little
better. Had two lesser known actors been cast for the main roles, the
film might have been a bit more interesting as both Mara and Blanchet
turn in nothing you haven't seen before from them.The problems of the movie are simply a lack of story progression and
turns of events. The film just kind of plods on for 2 hours and then
ends, without offering the viewer anything other than pretty sets and a
predictable script. The story itself is just way too thin to really
hold one's attention.5/10

I think that Cate Blanchett has seen better days and better movies to
be in, I'm tired of all the Lesbian, and Gay agenda movies out there. I
see it in regular broadcast TV every night, I don't want it in my face
all the time, Rooney Mara wasn't any good in the Dragon Tattoo and she
isn't any better in this movie, if you want a movie that appeals to the
alternate crowd you have it here, but this isn't a mainstream movie,
and it's not going to appeal to many people, which translates into it
not making much money. Kyle Chandler is OK, and so is Sarah Paulson,
but beyond that it's not much of a movie, the lady that wrote the book
must have been a closet lesbian and this was her out,(Patricia
Highsmith) to bad she is dead, "She was a mean, hard, cruel, unlovable,
unloving person" that is how she was described, maybe because she never
came out of the closet.

Having seen Carol in pre-screenings, I can say that it is a typical
film that's only purpose is to win awards. It did not entertain me very
much, especially because of its very slow pace. However, the film does well when it comes to the acting. Kate Blanchett
and Rooney Mara are both fantastic, but that doesn't make up for the
other lackluster aspects of the film. The story could have been done
better and, again, part of this is due to its slow pacing. Additionally, Carol, unfortunately, tries to "pull a boyhood" by
promoting its 11 year development period, which, in turn, will increase
a critical response as it will look as if more effort were put into the
film.Don't trust the critics, Carol isn't that special. Many other films
currently out, like Steve Jobs and Inside Out should be given more love
than this movie.
