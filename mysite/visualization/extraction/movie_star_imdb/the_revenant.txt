A lot has been said and written about this film, mostly about its
troubled production - forget all that: it has no meaning whatsoever for
the experience this film provides. A word of advice though: if you go
in expecting a testosterone-fueled revenge thriller in the vein of
'Apocalypto', you'll likely end up disappointed. It's simply not that
kind of film - but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it if you watch it
with the right expectations.'The Revenant' opens with images from a dream; we see snippets of
memories showing a peaceful life - and soon the loss of that peace, and
the loss of life. The images change and we hear the soothing sound of
gurgling water as we follow the camera via a long tracking shot over a
flooded forest; it's an image that seems to imply peace, evoking
nature's beauty with an almost meditative quality - before the barrel
of a rifle appears in the frame.Those first three minutes I just described (which are the only spoilers
you will get in this review) set the tone for the film perfectly. It's
a film that tells a story of harrowing circumstances through images
that are breathtakingly beautiful; a film about survival and death and
shocking acts of sudden violence - and yet a film that, despite all its
visceral intensity, also has a quiet, immersive quality to it that
feels almost hypnotic.Many critics and reviewers have pointed out the stark contrast between
the film's poetic beauty and the ugliness of its violence - implying
the director wanted to use this contrast to make a certain point
regarding mankind's interference with nature. While that would seem
pretty obvious (and it probably is at least partly true), I left the
film feeling Iñarritu had shown a vaster, far too complete image of the
clash between man and nature to justify such a simplistic
interpretation of the events portrayed on screen. Whether intentionally
or not, Iñarritu shows the star of his film with a complexity and
honesty that we normally don't get to see in these kinds of stories.
And I'm not talking about Leonardo DiCaprio here (who gives a
no-holds-barred, crazy good performance and I'd love to see him win an
Oscar for this film) - the star of this film is not a person: it IS
nature, plain and simple.The revenge plot - which felt almost like an afterthought or a ploy to
give the film a certain structure and a proper ending - is not really
the film's main theme or strongest aspect, and it certainly isn't the
reason that made this film so compelling to watch for me. Such stories
have been told often enough - and often better - than in 'The
Revenant'. No, what really made this film stand out for me is that I
have NEVER seen a Hollywood film (any film, really - apart from
documentaries) that showed nature in such an unflinchingly honest and
mesmerizing way as was the case here. And the way I perceive it,
Iñarritu sees his human protagonists as being very much a part of
nature as a whole - regardless of their destructive behaviour. It's that refreshingly wholistic approach (which some viewers might
perceive as nihilism on the director's part) that I found to be the
film's biggest accomplishment: it depicts the people in this story as
just another species trying to survive in that perilous frontier-world.
The emphasis is not really on the moral aspects of the brutal injustice
that the main character suffers or how the Native Americans are cruelly
exploited; we witness all that - but Iñarritu keeps a certain emotional
distance, as if he were shooting a documentary about predatory
wildlife. And just like the bear's attack, most of the violence in this
film comes as a reaction of defense. Be it self-defense, defending
one's offspring or defending territory and valuable resources. Even the
character that comes closest to an actual villain is driven by fear -
not hate, and his most obvious character defects were caused by a very
traumatizing experience. As in nature, there is a simple (if often
brutal) logic to why most characters, men or beasts, act the way they
do in 'The Revenant' (OK, maybe not the French - but I didn't say the
film was perfect, did I). And the bear attack was the most realistic
depiction of an animal attack I have ever seen on film.All in all, this film felt less like a story of revenge and more like
an ode to the visceral beauty of nature and the relentless, savage
force that is life; it provides an immensely absorbing - and touching -
experience to those who have an affinity for the wilderness, but it's
also a visual masterpiece and a great piece of old-school filmmaking
for lovers of Cinema. It's not perfect (especially during the last
third of the film where I felt the pacing was a bit off), but it's a
film the likes of which we will only rarely get to see - if at all - in
the future. 'The Revenant' is visual poetry of the most primal kind,
and it should be seen on the biggest screen possible. 9 stars out of 10
from me.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/

You are almost immediately plunged into the action, in a similar way to
the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan', with a Native American attack on
a group of fur trappers. DiCaprio even does that momentarily deaf thing
that Tom Hanks does. Lots of bows and arrows and gore and excellent
photography that is really immersive. Great opening scene.There there's the scene where DiCaprio is mauled by a grizzly bear.
Again, really believable, exciting and up front and personal - you can
almost smell the bear's stinking breath. Brilliant. And then there's ... well ... not much really. Photography and scenery
are by and large excellent but you do get the feeling that better use
could have been made of them. Iñárritu often seems to chop scenes
around for no particular reason, although you do get the occasional
sense of the vast wilderness that comes over well on the big screen.Dialogue is scarce. Most of it goes to Tom Hardy who tries to put on a
Texan accent but succeeds in sounding as if he has a sock in his mouth
(does he specialise in being inaudible? remember him as the mumbling
Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises'?). Then there's the storyline. You know the ending, right? (Just look up
the definition of 'revenant'.) Leo is up against it and he suffers a
great deal. But you know he is going to survive. So when, to top
everything, he falls off a cliff on his horse you realise he's actually
become Mr Indestructible. And two and a half hours of crawling,
grimacing and wincing does not a very entertaining film make.There are also several non-credible plot twists. Like when Tom Hardy
(a.k.a. The Mumbler) somehow cracks an impressive-looking safe and
makes off with the garrison money and just two guys go after him,
including the garrison commander. This nicely sets up the final
confrontation between Mr Indestructible and The Mumbler .... but
really? We also develop little or no emotional connection with the main
character. The silent dream scenes are a clichéd way of trying to do
this and they don't work in my opinion - they're just puzzling and
boring. Nor do we see much of the relationship between Leo and his son
to set up the emotional links between them - just Leo being harsh and
dishing out tough love a couple of times. The pacing is also poor. Once you've passed the opening scene and the
grizzly scene, feel free to go and refresh your popcorn - you won't
miss much. Overall, the film is self-consciously bleak and overdetermined and is
unevenly paced. A better director might possibly have made this a good
film but Iñárritu is clearly not David Lean.If DiCaprio gets an Oscar for this it will be because the Academy think
they owe him one and possibly because of the hype. This is a film that
will be forgotten. If you want to see a good silent movie with snow,
ice, struggle for survival and even the odd grizzly bear thrown in,
watch Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' - it's far more entertaining.

Take the direction of Alejandro González Iñárritu, combine it with the
stunning cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki and toss in Leonardo
DiCaprio and Tom Hardy for their acting charms and what do you get? An
extraordinary and masterful film.Fresh off of 'Birdman,' Iñárritu moved straight on to 'The Revenant,' a
western-epic inspired by the true-life experiences of frontiersman Hugh
Glass in the winter-struck landscape of 1820s America. The film gained
some notoriety in mid-2015 for its production problems and has thus
been regarded one of the most challenging film shoots in the history of
cinema. Rightfully so. The film opens with the soothing sound of
running water, thrusting the audience into an almost meditative state,
and then it strikes, an action-packed sequence ensues with a near
single sweeping take. Now this is a spoiler-free review, so I'll leave
the pleasure of viewing that scene to you.This film heavily evokes reactions from the audience and does so well,
whether it's staring at the screen in awe or gasping at the visceral
violence, if you face this film with the right attitude and
expectations, it will be a thrill ride like no other. Lubezki has
proved that he is one of the most fantastic cinematographers of modern
cinema, and the extensive use of natural lighting over artificial
supports that statement even further, the film is beyond stunning.
Supporting this is the score from the relatively unknown composers,
believe me, when the sudden orchestral boom strikes your eardrums, it's
mesmerising.The makeup, the direction, the editing, the visual aesthetics, and of
course the performances from a hopefully soon-to-be Oscar winning
DiCaprio, 'The Revenant' is a visual treat for those who appreciate
cinema and for those who wish to just get absorbed by the immense
landscapes and poetic justice Iñárritu has given it. This is, for me, a
modern masterpiece.

The Revenant falls into the same category as Aronofsky's "Requiem for a
Dream" and Spielberg's "Schindler's List" for me, in the essence of
being a terrific movie but not something I think I can sit through a
second time. In all these movies there are brutal sequences that cause
emotional stress and disgust just watching because it is so REAL and
GRIPPING. To think that events in these movies actually happened or
that they could very well happen is too much for me to think about. Not
to say that I did not enjoy this film thoroughly. The Revenant is a technical masterpiece that left me wondering "How the
hell did they do that?" after many scenes and sequences. With beautiful
cinematography and adroit camera movement this film is a visual magnum
opus. It is apparent that the great minds that put forth this film are
none other than the same ones that brought us Birdman: Lubezki and
Inarritu. There are many long shots without cuts that are sprinkled
throughout the film that add a sense of sophistication to it with the
added bonus of predominantly location based shooting and natural
lighting for the film , that can even make a novice film watcher raise
an eyebrow at its complexity. The camera work is not the only noteworthy aspect of the film; The
actors did a superb job executing their rolls. Many are raving about
DiCaprio's performance but I was more of a fan of Hardy's brutal and
gritty character Fitzgerald. Granted, half the words that came out of
his mouth were unintelligible but he left no doubt in my mind that he
was fully devoted to his role and bringing Fitzgerald alive instead of
just Hardy playing a character named Fitzgerald. He was simply amazing.With all this said, there are still flaws in the film. At some points
it was dragging on and moving too slow. It gave the impression that the
film itself was cocky and wanted to show off all of its beautiful
scenery and camera work too much. Then there was the "he shouldn't be
alive" situations. Hugh Glass was a real guy that really did survive a
bear mauling but in the film they make this guy practically immortal.
There were too many instances where I was thinking "he should be dead
three times over right now, for me to enjoy the film as much I should
have. All in all a great film that I only recommend to seasoned and mature
film viewers.

What an absolute waste of 2.5 hours.It didn't look like it was going to be my type of film, but the trailer
was very convincing, not to mention the plethora of award nominations
it has received, so I decided to give it a go.Mistake.It started with a collection of superb actors, delivering solid
performances. Despite what I've read, I thought Tom Hardy's accent was
spot on - that is what that accent sounds like! Domhnall Gleeson is in
everything these days, for good reason, and Will Poulter was certainly
endearing. Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent, dragging oneself through
the snow post-bear mauling should be pretty torturous, and as we know
from Wolf of Wall Street's infamous 'Ludes' scene, DiCaprio is a pro at
crawling and grunting.A cast such as this should have delivered an outstanding movie, so I
can only assume something went catastrophically wrong with the script.
Because my God was it BORING.There was absolutely zero character development. If you're going to
produce something that is on the long side, at least give me something
to work with here? The son was killed so early (and following so few
lines) I genuinely didn't care, which didn't help to lay a foundation
for why I should care about Glass's prolonged revenge mission. As well as the characters being entirely 2D, they also quickly became
parodies of themselves. "The Revenant Presents: Domhnall Gleeson as the
Principled Yet Naive Captain (who must die as punishment for his
ineptitude); Tom Hardy as the Southern Villain (with no redeeming
features, who likewise must die to maintain the idea of a Just World);
Will Poulter as the Impressionable Young Soldier-type and Leonardo
DiCaprio as the Tortured Hero. Don't forget the Arrogant French
Braggarts, and the Wise Yet Ruthless Indigenous People. Oh and Tom
Hardy's Random Cockney Friend."While I still think Hardy's accent was well executed, the choice to use
an accent which is often a source of ridicule (I'm not endorsing that
view) only served to undermine the tension rather than build it, making
him seem like a fool rather than a dangerous adversary. Admittedly, he
did a kill a number of people so maybe playing The Fool was his way of
lulling everyone into a false sense of security.DiCaprio was convincing in his role of the Aggrieved Father avenging
the death of his son, but his journey of adversity quickly became
absurd rather than laudable. The bear attack was BRUTAL, and as his
company quickly concluded, it seems unlikely he would have survived his
injuries, particularly when being carted around in the depth of winter. But no, not only does he survive, he also survives Hardy's attempt to
smother him, and being dragged into a partial burial, as well as
witnessing the murder of his son (which would be enough to render any
of us catatonic). OK, this might be plausible, maybe.Then he wanders around for a bit, spurred on by the prospect of
vengeance, before being nearly drowned in a river. Again, the trip down
the rapids would have been enough to drown the average man, let alone
someone who has just suffered a savage bear attack followed by an
attempted smothering. But no, he comes to a gentle stop at the river
bank and has a nap - mysteriously without succumbing to hypothermia.Cue more wandering, some assistance from a kindly fellow wanderer, and
yet more wandering.As if three potential deaths weren't enough (four if you account for
the bear effectively attacking him twice), he's then under attack by
the very people who's daughter he's just rescued, and not only does he
not get shot (despite these people having been shown to be
frighteningly accurate), his horse RIDES HIM OFF A CLIFF and surprise,
surprise - HE LIVES! In fact, he doesn't just survive it, he guts the
dead horse and SLEEPS INSIDE IT. *Beats chest asserting manliness*By the end I was desperate for one of them to just kill the other so I
could go home. Tom Hardy finally met his maker - not before uttering
the obligatory moral message that revenge doesn't make us feel better.The Revenant is a classic case of style over substance. Fantastic
actors, slipping effortlessly into a range of clichéd characters,
stunning cinematography, and zero emotion. I'm a crier, I will cry at
the majority of films and TV shows (and occasionally books), so the
fact that I not only didn't cry, but felt absolutely nothing towards
any of the characters, says it all.It's clearly a polarising piece of work, I've seen many other reviews
here that echo my sentiments, yet my boyfriend loved it, and the
average rating is currently 8.3! Unfortunately, Award Land appears to
be siding with my other half. This year's Oscar Best Picture category
is a crowded race with several worthy contenders - but the Revenant is
not one, and I really hope it doesn't win.Does DiCaprio deserve the nomination? He was one of the better things
in this film, and playing such a role must have pushed him to his
physical limits, so maybe he does. Frankly, he's massively overdue one
so for God's sake just give the man an Oscar and let's forget this
absurd study in masculine pride ever existed.

I went to see "The Revenant" on the day that it was nominated for 12
Oscars, which certainly sets the expectation that it is going to be
good  and it is. But I saw it described by DiCaprio as an "epic
art-house western" and that's a good description. In the same way that
Iñárritu's "Birdman" (this time last year) was unarguably a brilliant
but not very mainstream film, so I think the Oscar buzz will attract a
big audience to this movie who may find it a struggle to really enjoy.
Because it is bleak unremittingly bleak, in terms of the landscape,
the weather and the motives of the characters. It is also extremely
violent but, unlike "The Hateful Eight" (another film I saw this week
that was unremittingly bleak) the violence is much more gritty,
realistic and visceral making the drama a lot more compelling.DiCaprio plays "Hugh Glass", an historical figure who was a legendary
fur-trapper in the early 1800's and the central figure in this
bear-related yarn. Although the story has been re-embroidered over the
years, the 'facts' align with the film's basic story (there's a good
"Daily Telegraph" article outlining this - see the link on
bob-the-movie-man.com).Attacked and pursuing by local natives, Glass's party is striking
across woodland when he is viciously attacked by a 500lb Grizzly bear.
Although appearing mortally wounded, he is a highly respected
individual and so is stretchered up by his boss Captain Henry (Domhnall
Gleeson). Unable to proceed further, Henry pays for the mercenary John
Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay with him, together with his half-Pawnee
son Hawk and friend Bridger (Will Poulter), to die in peace.
Predictably, Fitzgerald is not to be trusted, and Glass is abandoned in
a shallow grave. If this is not enough, for other reasons we won't go
into, Glass has even less inclination to keep his fellow trapper on his
Christmas card list. Thus is set up a classic revenge movie, with Glass
determined to stay alive to enact that revenge despite the enormous
odds stacked against him.This is surely DiCaprio's year for his elusive Oscar as he turns in a
cripplingly painful performance. It is clear that the suffering on
screen is not all acting  it cannot be, given the inhospitable
conditions in which the crew were filming (in Canada and Argentina). As
examples he had to eat raw bison liver as well as suffering a much
discussed Han "I thought they smelled bad on the outside" Solo moment.
Despite having very few lines to deliver, DiCaprio is on screen for 90%
of the time, and it is a bravura performance.Tom Hardy  also Oscar nominated  is also impressive as the villain of
the piece, although for most of the time his lines might have well been
delivered through his Bain mask for the sense they made. He is an
inveterate mumbler.Domhnall Gleeson's performance is also compelling, adding a degree of
goodness and compassion to the film that was so missing from "The
Hateful 8". (Gleeson is surely vying this year with Ben Whishaw for the
busiest mainstream film appearances after this, "Ex Machina",
"Brooklyn" and "Star Wars"). Finally Will Poulter gets a chance to
shine in an A-grade mainstream dramatic movie and he well and truly
makes that grade.Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu has to be commended for eschewing the
use of green screens, insisting on live performances and in natural
light to boot. Stylistically (and indeed story-wise) the film has many
parallels with "Gladiator", with its effective and artistically
constructed dream sequences. But the film is not without special
effects, and these are phenomenal, most incredibly delivered during the
relentless and gruelling bear attack scene: a seamless blend of live
animal work and effects that make it horrifically believable.There is also some fantastic camera work (by Emmanuel Lubezki) of the
"how the hell did they do that variety". Recalling his work in
"Birdman" it's challenging to do single tracking shots of people
walking through buildings. To do these same tracking shots during a
pitched battle scene is just phenomenal. During one scene in this
harrowing sequence at the film's start, the camera is on the ground
filming a native galloping towards a victim, then the camera is
seamlessly filming the rider as he gallops away. Astonishing.The only area I really didn't care for was the music, by Carsten
Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. A combination of droning strings and
(later) some whiny "Ligeti-style" elements, it was in turns intrusive,
gloomy and annoying. Music should largely stay in the background to set
the mood. This didn't.Overall, this is a masterful film, but it is a slog and not a feel-good
film to sit through. It also has significant violence which might not
suit all viewers, with the final confrontation in particular being one
of the most visceral fight scenes I've seen in years.By the way (I had to look it up) the definition of "revenant" is:noun 1. a person who returns2. a person who returns as a spirit after death; ghost.Now you know too  this public service announcement brought to you by

Go and see this movie. In the cinema. As soon as possible.Simply put, it is an excellent story of family, revenge, survival, and
nature.The Revenant is one of the most beautifully-shot films I have ever
seen. I lost count of how many scenes I sat there in utter amazement,
which is undoubtedly due to the brilliant directing and spectacular
cinematography: there's no shaky-cam, no quick-cut editing, and a lot
of incredibly complex shots which appear to have been completed in a
single take. If all films were shot similarly to how the Revenant is,
then the movie industry would drastically improve.It must also be pointed out that the Revenant has won 3 Golden Globe
and has 12 Oscar nominations; if that isn't compelling enough evidence
of a fantastic film then I don't know what is.The entire cast did a phenomenal job and they all deserve recognition
for their performances; however, if Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an
Oscar for his breathtaking portrayal of Glass then that will be the
single biggest injustice of the year. Do not miss the opportunity to see this masterpiece on the big screen!UPDATE: I've read an unnerving amount of other user's reviews
complaining about the plot. I can understand that the plot may seem a
little basic or perhaps lacking at times; however, the plot is not what
makes this film so excellent, and I feel as though those who failed to
recognise this have seriously missed out. You don't just watch the
Revenant: you experience it. Every single element from the music to the
cinematography is cleverly concocted to draw you into the film and put
you alongside the cast in the brutal wintry conditions. If you've not
been drawn in due to being too concerned with the premise of the story,
then I fear you've missed a truly enthralling and one-of-a-kind
cinematic experience.

The natural landscape and some of the scenes are overwhelming and
spectacular! The camera-work is so immersive, you believe are a part of
Hugh Glass' journey through the wilderness and back to civilization.
Also with great performances not only by DiCaprio, but also Hardy, as
the unsympathetic fellow fur trapper leaving Glass behind. Story-wise, it is a bit thin for a 156 min picture. Glass' quest for
vengeance is sometimes lost as he utters few words about his drive and
is being more or less, chased himself. The story arc of the Indians
quest for their daughter felt a bit out of place and strange. We also
get to see the fur trappers p.o.v. that left Glass behind and the
Captain way ahead of them. Which in my opinion takes a little bit of
the magic of Glass' total perilous journey.All my stars goes to the beauty, production value and performances
alone! Regardless, this is one of those overlong movies one like, but
would not sit out for another viewing!

I cannot believe how many people think this is a good movie....watching
a guy struggle to survive for 2 hours ...come on people..I know there
are not many good movies being made but my word....so many things are
unbelievable...the bear attack, carrying a near dead guy out of the
wilderness up a mountain...going over a cliff on a horse and not
getting hurt...spending long periods of time in freezing cold
water.....surviving extreme cold overnight inside a dead horse...my god
the list is endless....and for Leo's so called acting don't get me
started...a lot of crawling and moaning and groaning....the whole thing
was a letdown and really a waste of time...also tell the director to
back the camera up a bit on those facial close-ups...they were also
ridiculous...trust me save your money and go see The Hateful Eight.

I was hoping for something a bit more interesting than Hollywood's
standard approach to cowboys and indians, especially as the film seems
to have been critically acclaimed and Leo is a great actor. The quality of the camera-work is excellent and the bear mauling scene
very accomplished if that is the right way to describe such a visceral
few minutes. But oh the plot. If you try to take it seriously it fails
utterly. As an Indiana Jones caper it lacks wit. Too often you say 'I
know he'd be dead from hypothermia/blood loss etc etc in any possible
world but I'll just keep watching in case something interesting
happens'. You ride your horse over a 150 foot drop, fall into a tree,
and survive. You travel downstream in an icy river in your fur coat and
don't drown/freeze. You manage to light a fire even when you are
9/10ths dead, there are no branches and you're flint went a few scenes
ago. What a relief when the baddie is finally left to his fate, but
then you realise you've just wasted 2 hours of your life.

"The Revenant" is probably the most beautiful movie I have seen for a
long time. This is not only due to the incredible locations, but also
to the excellent (and by excellent I mean excellent) camera-work.
Frequently I was just blown away by the sheer beauty of the rough
terrain of Canada and how it was captured by the crew. However, there
are a few drawbacks. Mainly the story (it is a very simple revenge
story line) and the dialog (it is basically not existent :D).When I first left the movie I was still blown away by all the great
things I mentioned above (I was thinking about a 10/10 rating), but the
longer I was outside the movie the more I recognized that "The
Revenant" is a film that is incredible entertaining whilst sitting in
the cinema, but also a movie I quickly forgot about when being at home
again.Still, the movie is definitely a must-see. Your money is well invested!

"The Revenant" marks a big turn for both star Leonardo DiCaprio and
director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Following up on his roles as
maniacal tycoons in "Django Unchained" and "The Wolf of Wall Street",
DiCaprio plays a fur trapper abandoned in the snowed-in wilderness.
It's intense enough knowing that this was a true story, but how they
film it makes it even more so. Like "Birdman", the movie contains
several long shots filmed in a naturalistic style to create a sense of
realism. Hugh Glass's determination to survive and find those who
abandoned him provides one of the most harrowing stories ever put on
screen. Covered in blood, sweat and dirt, DiCaprio spends much of the
movie not talking, keeping the focus on his actions. And by actions, I
mean that you rarely see something this intense on screen.I'd say that the movie deserved its Golden Globe wins (but it
repeatedly irritated me that the presenters kept mispronouncing
Alejandro González Iñárritu's name). And while accepting his award,
DiCaprio spoke up for the world's indigenous peoples and called on
people to protect the environment from corporate interests. Indeed we
should heed his call. In the meantime, definitely see "The Revenant".
It's an experience like you can't imagine.

What a waste of a night. Spoiler alert! Here is the whole movie in 30
seconds.A guy almost dies, a guy walks, a guy builds a fire, the guy almost
dies again, walks some more, goes for a swim, builds a fire, almost
dies, goes for a swim again, builds a fire, makes it back safely, goes
back out again, finds a fire, almost dies, makes someone else go for a
swim. Looks into the camera deeply. The end.Best supporting actor to the bear. My life would have been better had
you finished the job.I'm pretty sure this script was two pages long, and they turned it into
a 2.5 hour movie. The closed captioning graphic artist had more words
than any one else in the movie.

This was, in my opinion, one of the best movies of 2015. The way the
movie was filmed was astonishing, the actors were great and the story
was good as well. The film was shot using only natural light so all of
the scenes in the movie look authentic. I have never seen a film shot
so gracefully to the point where when each scene starts I am amazed
again. Every scene feels like you are in it. And the bear scene that
everyone is talking about, is mind-blowing. Honestly, I do not know how
they did that but if you see the movie for nothing else, see it for the
bear. The actors did very good as well. Leonardo DiCaprio has another
stand out performance along with Tom Hardy who did great as well. Many
people felt like DiCaprio did not show enough emotion for his role but
I think he played the role perfectly for the type of character he was.
I do not think this was his best performance but I also do not think
this was his worst, it is one of his best. The story did not carry the
film to me. I felt like it was a good story but the acting and the
visuals of the movie really carried it. So, Story (How well the story was) -8.5 Re watch (Are you able to watch this movie multiple times)-8.5 Cinematography (How well the movie was made) -10Overall, 9/10

Shot using all natural light, The Revenant is one of the most gorgeous
films you will ever see. Leonardo Dicaprio deserves his first Oscar for
his incredibly dedicated performance, easily the best of his career and
Tom Hardy gives an Oscar worthy performance for his role as the
haunting beast John Fitzgerald. The first act of the film was
definitely the most impressive. With stunning visuals and flawlessly
crafted intense action scenes, I felt like I was watching real footage
from the 1820's! Then the vast snowy wilderness kicked in, the majority
of the time it was breathtaking. But at times The Revenant got a little
lost in the wilderness and sometimes felt a bit repetitive, it's still
an unpredictable and suspenseful adventure with many surprises. It's no
doubt one of the years best films.

I went into this movie with high expectations. I came out feeling like
i'd just sat through a long funeral for someone I didn't know, on a hot
and humid day. *********MASSIVE SPOILERS******** I BASICALLY DESCRIBE THE WHOLE MOVIE
IN DETAIL *********The movie started out great with a little action scene and a little bit
about the main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son. After that,
with very little else about the story or anything to tie viewers into
it, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear because for some reason he's in the
forest alone after just being raided and destroyed by some Indian
tribe, who are looking for some random girl. (maybe i'm missing
something but that's about all I took from the beginning of the movie)So the rest of the "Americans" come and rescue DiCaprio from underneath
the bear he just killed after it nearly mauled him to death, and for
some reason he survives even though in reality he'd probably had lost
enough blood at that point to kill three people. The rest of the middle
of the movie is watching DiCaprio breathe heavily and crawl around the
forest floor with some cinematic shots of snow, and listening to Tom
Hardy attempt to cover up his terrible accent by speaking as low as
possible. Oh and did I mention DiCaprio has an Indian kid? Yea so he
has a kid, the kids mom and tribe was massacred by Americans or French
or something like that, and DiCaprio is really close to the kid and
vice versa. (Yes it's the predictable average story of revenge)So Tom Hardy kills DiCaprio's kid because the kid doesn't want him to
kill his father. Then they leave DiCaprio behind to die (BUT GUESS
WHAT??? THE MAIN CHARACTER DIDN'T DIE! WOW! DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE COMING)so he regains strength, gets some support from some random Indian dude
who also lost his family, but to another tribe, and then some French
dudes who have the girl the other tribe is looking for, find and kill
the other Indian dude, but don't see DiCaprio apparently even though he
was in a giant wood shelter with a fire going. DiCaprio becomes hero
and saves the girl, kills some french dudes, and rides off to get his
"revenge"And you know what happens next?? HE GETS HIS REVENGE!@!!!@#!@ WOW WEE
WHAT AN ADVENTURE Movie ends with the Indian tribe who got their girl back finishing off
Tom Hardy with a hatchet or knife, and they walk past Leo and leave him
alone. Seriously though, I don't understand the hype around this movie. It WAS
Oscar bait, because 90% of the movie is Leo breathing heavy, acting as
injured and in pain as possible crawling around grunting and moaning. The only good thing about the movie was the cinematic shots and scenes,
but nothing else. Insanely bland and generic story with a good setting. I actually like most of DiCaprio's movies, and I think he should've had
an Oscar a long time ago, but I don't feel it should be for this movie.

Revenant was the worst movie I've ever seen. If you want to pay $7 to
watch almost 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping and breathing
heavily in the snow, it's the perfect movie for you.It was also really inaccurate as the dude Leo was playing was somehow
very literate and wrote in present day English. This would not have
been the case. it was really unnecessary to have this detail in it. The only enjoyable part for me was the symbolism of Leo's rebirth as he
was coming out of the horse that he was in due to the weather. I am only writing the last two things because i can't upload the first
paragraph unless i have 10 lines. But seriously. Do not waste your money on this movie. Pirate it if you
really wanna see it, but even then, it isn't even worth the time.

One of, if not the worst, movies if ever seen. wanted to leave after 30
minutes, but stuck it out for thirty more, hoping it would get better.
When it became obvious that Glass would survive and get his revenge
after another hour and a half of boring action, we left. Plot is boring
and obvious. Wish I could get my price of admission back. Sadly a big
waste of time and money. Is this the best the film industry can do?
Hopefully not. Would not recommend this to anyone. Actually am
embarrassed to admit I stuck it out for as long as I did. Terrible!
Terrible! Terrible! Spoiler alert? Really? Plot is so obvious! Dialog
is stupid. Character development non-existent. etc., etc., etc

I haven't seen all of Alejandro González Iñárritu's films. Those I have
seen were excellent or at least very good: "Amores Perros", "21 Grams",
"Babel" and "Birdman".When I saw the trailer for "The Revenant", needless to say, I
immediately thought it had tremendous potential and got pretty hyped up
about it. It showed gorgeous, naturally-lit cinematography, dynamic
directing, a historical depiction of the early 19th century savagery,
and what seemed to be quite a visceral performance by Leonardo
DiCaprio.I thought that, with Iñárritu's name attached to it, this would be a
much deeper film than what I ended up watching, at least in its
depictions of history, first nations, and in its ability to exploit
classic themes such as revenge and survival.Without saying that "The Revenant" is an empty shell (although a
gorgeous one), Iñárritu's film fails to impress when it comes to depth,
thanks to a linear and predictable narrative structure, one dimensional
characters, and a revenge plot that never manages to be compelling to
the audience.DiCaprio offers a demanding, physical performance with very little
dialogue, but his character, always in survival mode, never reached me
emotionally. All the agony grunting and wincing, enhanced by the
costumes and make up sure make the character believable, but the script
never allows the character to develop or to unfold anything that goes
beyond an extremely narrow range of emotions. Very unfortunate.Tom Hardy is okay as the antagonist, another character that suffers
from his development being jilted by the writers. This is an
unfortunate mistake to make in a revenge-themed film, where the
antagonist is supposed to nourish the quest. In "The Revenant", the
antagonist is barely a background character that will leave the
audience almost emotionless and neutral.The directing (Alejandro González Iñárritu) and cinematography
(Emmanuel Lubezki) are the highlights here. Visually, "The Revenant" is
flawless. The framing of the shots, the camera movements and the snowy,
low-saturation imagery are all gorgeous. Some scenes are absolutely
incredible to watch.Editing-wise, Stephen Mirrione could have cut a few corners here and
there. And this is coming from a movie enthusiast who sure appreciates
a slow-paced film. Watching Hugh Glass walk through the endless forest
was great, but you do see at least a dozen very-low angle shots of
trees. They're just as beautiful as they're eerie, but slightly
redundant at times. Overall, "The Revenant" is not a bad film. It just isn't a great one
either. It does have its moments. Definitely a case of style over
substance, "The Revenant" disappoints both as a revenge tale and as a
meditation on the savagery of both man and nature. Plot-wise, its flaws
keep "The Revenant" in a linear survival tale in which revenge becomes
secondary.Too bad.

Since the first trailers of this movie came out I knew it would be an
experience. Following the incredible Birdman, director Alejandro G.
Iñárritu had the public anxiously awaiting his interpretation of this
bleak survival story, and much like Birdman, Iñárritu is also the star
of this film. The Revenant has some of the most beautiful
cinematography I've ever seen. It's cold, visceral, and almost entirely
authentic from the use of natural lighting to the barebones yet
powerful storytelling. You can tell Iñárritu poured his heart into this
project and it pays off tremendously. This is not to discount the
incredible performances of DiCaprio and Hardy (DiCaprio finally getting
his well-overdue Oscar), but it's hard to imagine the movie being so
impactful had another director been at the helm. The story is as simple as it gets. In the 1800s, a group of settlers
escape an ambush by an indigenous tribe, and during their travels one
man gets separated from the group and gets brutally attacked by a wild
bear and subsequently left for dead by his team. It's a revenge story
more than anything. What it also highlights is human perseverance and
the will to live. The things that happen to this man are truly horrific
and difficult to watch. I'm not sure what parts of the story were
embellished or Hollywoodized, but this film sucks you into this world
and puts you right alongside this fatally wounded man desperate to
survive. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heart-wrenching performance as Hugh
Glass, expressing a wide range of emotions despite the limited
dialogue. Tom Hardy is also phenomenal as one of the most vile,
wretched human beings on the planet. This guy is despicable to the
core, and you forget you're watching Tom Hardy at times because he's
completely absorbed in the role. The supporting cast is great as well
despite their small time on screen. As far as performances and
cinematography goes, The Revenant is flawless.What prevents this from getting a perfect 10 is one particular
storyline that I didn't think was needed, and it involves the wife of
Hugh Glass. She's never developed as a character but she appears
intermittently in visions and dreams and it almost sucks you out of the
movie for a second because of how intense the main narrative is. But
this is a very small gripe. From beginning to end this movie had me on
the edge of my seat, my jaw on the floor and my eyes glued to the
screen. The Revenant is definitely not for everyone, but it's
impossible not to appreciate it for the breathtaking cinematic
achievement that it is.

The Revenant is a drama/thriller film based on the story by Michael
Punke about a frontiersman named Hugh Glass. Glass sets out on a path
of revenge after witnessing his son's death at the hands of the man who
left him to die. Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu.The excellent cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki really brought this
film to life on almost all levels. It greatly enhanced the acting by
creating an immense sense of realism throughout the entire film.
However, The Revenant easily could have been a 2 hour and 15 minute
film, as opposed to 2 hours and 36, and still send the same message.
Lengthy shots of Glass' surroundings and very little dialogue made this
film feel a little longer than it was. The direction, however, was on
point by Mr. Iñárritu the entire way, and every other aspect of the
film was too, except for the plot. Very one dimensionally, the
Revenant's entire storyline is focused on revenge, and that's about it,
sure there was more dialogue and some beautifully choreographed action
scenes in the beginning, but the rest of the film was mainly just Glass
dragging himself hundreds of miles across almost impossibly tricky
terrain. DiCaprio, Hardy, and Gleeson's performances were very good,
along with the direction and the cinematography. It is a shame that
these three actors, plus Mr. Iñárritu, and Mr. Lubezki, all teamed up
for a film with a weak screenplay with not much too it. It would be
great too see a similar combo of actors, directors, and
cinematographers team up for a much more well-rounded film.Direction: 9/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 9/10 Music: 8/10
Screenplay: 4/10Overall: 8/10

I made the mistake of reading up on the life of the real Hugh Glass
(the character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio) before seeing the film.
What I saw on-screen was a very distorted/Hollywoodized version of his
story with lots of unnecessary racism thrown in (because, you know,
Hollywood just can't pass up the chance to bash Whitey whenever
possible). Inarritu takes a simple survival story and turns it into a
violent, gory revenge story. Sensationalism for the sake of
sensationalism abounds. So do clichés.There is some speculation that the real Hugh Glass may have married a
Pawnee Indian woman during a period (which ended a couple of years
before the events depicted in the film) when he lived with the tribe.
However, there is no surviving documentation, either public records or
correspondence to/from Glass, that mentions a wife. In the film, Glass
has a Pawnee wife who we see in flashbacks getting murdered by an evil,
White soldier because, you know, White people are horrible and
Hollywood wants you to know that.The real Hugh Glass had no children. Movie-Glass has a half-Indian son
who he coaches to act "invisible" because the (racist) White men they
work with will only see his skin color. His son later gets murdered by
an evil, White man because, you know, White people are awful and
Hollywood wants to make sure you understand that.Real-Glass never killed an army officer. Movie-Glass, it is revealed in
flashbacks, once killed an evil, White lieutenant who was trying to
murder his very young son because, you know, White people are just
terrible and Hollywood will not let you forget that.Real-Glass did not rescue a woman during his arduous journey back to
the fort. Movie-Glass not only rescues an Indian woman but he rescues
her while she's being raped by an evil, White, French guy because, you
know, White people (no matter where they're from) are just horrid and
Hollywood will remind you of that as often as possible.Real-Glass was helped along on his odyssey by some friendly Sioux
Indians, none of whom were killed by White people in the process.
Movie-Glass is helped by one Indian who is later murdered by evil,
White, Frenchmen because, you know, White people are reprehensible and
in case you still weren't sure yet Hollywood will BLUDGEON YOU OVER THE
HEAD WITH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!Fabricating a bunch of racist scenarios in order to move the story
along and provide impetus for the main character is cheap and lazy
screen-writing.Real-Glass did not get any revenge on John Fitzgerald, other than
getting his rifle back. Movie-Glass gets a very violent, bloody
revenge. Real-Glass eventually let go of his anger and forgave Bridger
and Fitzgerald. Movie-Glass has a weird quasi-redemption where he stops
short of finishing Fitzgerald off but then sends him on to certain
death at the hands of another. So, is that redemption, really?The film goes way overboard depicting Glass as a super-man. I'm sure
men were made of sturdier stuff back in the 1820s but when he and the
horse hit that tree I just thought, "Oh, COME ON!!" The guy wasn't even
fully recovered from getting mauled (and rolled on) by a 300-400 pound
grizzly bear yet! And, no, he did not fall off a cliff in real life.
Did I mention that the bear attack actually happened in August and
Glass reached the fort in October? So, there was no crawling through
snow or wading through icy water in freezing temperatures either. How
would he not have hypothermia and/or frostbite after weeks of that?!Movie-Glass occasionally has dreams where he hears his dead wife
murmuring analogies about trees because nothing screams, "This movie is
really, really deep!" like whispered dream-guidance from a dead
Native-American.Yes, there is lots of striking cinematography of beautiful scenery.
Much has been made of the fact that Inarritu used only natural light
and it does work well with the tone of the film.The bear attack is both impressive and horrifying. If you know anything
about how to react to a bear attack you will cringe in horror at Glass'
stupidity. (Note to screenwriter: bears HIBERNATE in the Winter!)The music is good.I was surprised that DiCaprio won the Golden Globe and I'll be
disappointed if he wins the Oscar. He gives a good performance in the
film but I just don't think it's an Oscar-caliber role."The Revenant" is sensational but not in a good way.

In real life, Hugh Glass was mauled by a grizzly & left for dead, but
managed to drag himself back to a frontier outpost. The cinematic
handling of the story in Revenant, however, is straight out of Cormac
McCarthy: heavy-handed with funereal music & gray-scale tones
throughout, creating an overall impression that the sun rarely ever
shone in those mountains in those times. Just watching it becomes a
test of endurance. Cold, colorless, dismal, stark, bleak, brutal,
dispiriting & ultimately pointless. Perhaps that was how these men
actually lived their lives? Maybe that's the point? If there is one?At the end of the film, we're left not even knowing whether Glass,
after exacting vengeance on the man who killed his son, lives or dies
himself. Or perhaps that doesn't matter? Perhaps none of it matters?
Ptui! Worst film I've watched since Deadman.

If 'Inspired by true events' means once again telling the vague, half
truth, white man version of a story, then yes, that's exactly what
happened. If it really is about the 'power of the human spirit', then
maybe focus on the unbelievable resilience of the Native Americans that
get constantly ignored in history!DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, for roughly 30 minutes, then allows the
viewer to not have to hear his voice for the remaining 2 hours of the
film. And I'm sorry to say that his attempt to illicit my emotions with
just his expressions was a failure and only made me wish the bear had
finished him off...sorry. Nothing about this performance screams Oscar,
and none of his previous performances do either, which is why he
doesn't have one! Tom Hardy plays Fitzgerald, your standard ruthless, racist, Texas
d-bag, which he completely pulls off, with the exception of his voice.
If he had hit his mark, then perhaps this was award worthy but instead,
as with most of his other roles, he struggled with the accent and he
succumbed to mumbling and incoherent speech. A shame really, so close
to a perfect performance.Forrest Goodluck is perfect as Hawk, and honestly he could have pulled
off main character status had the film been centered around him! He was
flawless!!! I felt what he felt and all I wanted was more of all of it.
This kid will have no problem getting work in the future.If anything the DP deserves an Oscar for the stunning locations and
incredible aesthetics in this film but that unfortunately is all it
deserves. Cinematography was definitely the 12th man that brought this
film to its peak.Just my opinion

I personally found this movie to be boring. Definitely one of the most
boring movies I've ever seen. Yes, it looks good visually, but that's
all it has going for it. Even when something was happening, nothing
happened. They easily could have cut an hour out and it still would
have been boring, but at least it would have been so long and drawn
out. I feel that this is probably one of those movies that people will
claim to like because it's the popular thing to do. But seriously, how
many times can look at CG trees and still be amazed at how real they
look? In the end, this was two and a half hours of my life that I'll
never get back.

I was really looking forward to this, I love wilderness films. I was
slightly looking forward to it less when I realized it was a re-hash of
the classic Man in the Wilderness. Its a beautifully shot film with
some good moments but it just seems that Hollywood bods get together,
select a scenario and inject the same components over and over again.
This could have been a war film set in the 1990s, or a 'defense against
aliens' film set in 2200. Its the same growling macho performances,
tinged with an honor and pride that only seems to exist in the dream
world of Hollywood, finishing with a lesson that the human spirit,
especially if you are American, seems to know no bounds. Why not tell
the story like it is? People don't survive numerous powerful attacks by
the same bear, or manage to endlessly dodge weapons, bullets and Indian
ambushes. Build the story about what is realistic and inject some
subtlety around it. People were simpler in the 19th century - this lot
look like they have been spoon fed a cocktail of Tony Robbins and Bear
Grylls. People are so impressed with big stars, huge performances, epic
music and unworldly cinematography that they can't see that there is
just so much padding to this simplistic narrative of growling and
fighting. It's an OK film, it will win Oscars. Give me Richard Harris
any day over this.

It is a travesty. The scenery shots are boring and carelessly tacked on
to create a disparity between the violence and serenity of nature I
assume but it's really badly done. I think it's supposed to be arty? If
you watch the trailer, google some pics of Canadian landscape and
youtube that scene from star wars with the tauntaun you have basically
watched the movie. Don't waste your money. It is soulless Oscar fodder
and brings nothing new to cinema so if you want to watch the same old
story of a guy surviving against all odds because revenge and manpain
are powerful driving forces, go for it. You'll probably enjoy it. If
you want to watch something with beautiful editing or scenery or
costume design, there are way better films out there that do all of
this a lot better and have a more original storyline/progressive way of
showing that storyline. I found it very dull and Leo does not deserve
an Oscar. Maybe Tom Hardy does. But Mad Max was better so he should win
it for that.

My wife didn't want to see The Revenant because she thought it might've
been a bit blokey with all manner of violence and blood and
miscellaneous gore. And in truth she probably wouldn't have liked it
very much. So I went with a blokey-bloke , on a sort of mandate but
there certainly wasn't any handholding and personal spaces were very
much respected.The movie is about a grizzled frontiersman with good teeth who, in the
tradition of cinematic grizzled frontiersman was married to a native
American who dies when she is shot and a bird flies out of her. The
grizzled frontiersman with good teeth is called 'Glass' and played by
Lenny DiCaprio Glass and his mates slaughter gazillions of merkins and
they are attacked by vengeful native Americans who force them to row
down the river. They get off the boat for reasons that eluded me but
there were icebergs.Glass sees some bear cubs and their mother sees him and, possibly
having experience with grizzled frontiersmen with guns (or perhaps she
had seen 'Titanic'), gives him an absolute flogging. She ambles off
happy that lessons have been learned but they haven't and she returns
to give him an even more severer lesson and Glass shoots her and stabs
her and she is dead. We are given no information on what happens to the
cubs. I hope they survived.Glass doesn't die but more bad stuff happens to him than you could poke
a stick at and he is bent on revenge. Most of the bad stuff is the
result of a villain called Fitzgerald and a partial burial.Other bad stuff happens too and is the result of the French who are
likely all called 'Lucky Pierre'. Hey; it's an American movie!
Americans hate the French after they sensibly and quite correctly
stayed out of Iraq. I know some French folk and the loathing is
reciprocated. I digress.In keeping with the need for white grizzled frontiersmen to be seen as
fully rounded, modern, caring sensitive and sympathetic, Glass meets a
new native American bestie (with whom he shares Bison Liver Tartare)
and saves a chiefs daughter from a fate worse than death involving
Lucky Pierre. The bison was killed by a pack of digital wolves. To
further prove empathy Glass looks sadly at piles of Bison skulls that
appear at random throughout the film. The fate of the skulls he was
responsible for are not recorded, but beaver skulls are pretty little I
guess and without cinematic appeal.In truth, the vengeance trail is more than a little Wile E Coyote.
Every time he is about to succeed in his quest, something horrid and
deadly happens to him but he inexplicably survives to continue his
quest for the villainous Road Runner, Fitzy. Armed (presumably) with
ACME powder and matches he keeps on keeping on. In a biblical twist, he
is born-again! From a holy horse.Leonardo doesn't have a face that lends itself to looking vengeful.He has a magic coat that keeps him warm and toasty even after swimming
in icy rivers. He is a good swimmer too.In summary it is as plausible as a Bristol Palin abstinence lecture.
But there is lots and lots of really REALLY nice scenery and it was all
I could do to stop myself 'ooohing' and 'aaaahing' at the majesty of
it. There is a lot of snow and sundry chilliness and you should wear a
jumper if you see it, particularly if you are a sympathy-shiverer.

It's the Oscars season hooray! And everyone seems on the lookout for
who deserves the ultimate Hollywoodian honor and who is going to go
home with a gold Uncle Oscar. I've been avidly following the ceremony
for years now, but that doesn't necessarily mean I hold it in the
highest regard; everybody knows it's all politics at the end of the
day.Today I went to the cinema to watch this year's most talked about film,
Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant, trying so hard to ignore
the two Golden Globes, the 12 Oscars nominations and the 8.3 IMDb
rating. To cut things short: I was immensely let down, and here are my
reasons why:1) Iñárritu is a genius, there is no doubt about it, but geniuses are
obviously not immune to over-inflated ego. The Mexican director has
become popular with film critics and moviegoers worldwide for his
ability to make films that are both aesthetically and thematically
stunning  films that are so beautiful to look at and so touching you
could easily relate to. Who would ever forget the heartbreaking
realities of Amores Perros (2000) and Babel (2006)? And the surreal
worlds of Biutiful (2010) and Birdman (2014)? After those masterpieces,
The Revenant looks like a sheer act of muscle flexing. We get it,
Iñárritu! You can do magic with your camera; you can take beautiful
long shots, you can make a man-bear fight look so goddam real, you can
film inexplicable gore and violence like no one has ever done before,
yet I was bored to death because I couldn't feel the slightest
connection to anything or anyone. The film comes out visually
outstanding but cinematically fragile because it lacks the substance
that should hold it together. The entire plot is based on a father- son
relationship that wasn't developed enough (or wasn't developed at all)
for the viewer to emotionally connect with Hugh Glass, the revenant,
which made me feel that the whole survival quest was a bit on the
absurd side.2) Clichés. Clichés. Clichés! The film is so rife with clichés I
actually thought Iñárritu is playing some kind of a joke on us. A
die-hard hero, a classic mindless villain, a dead Pocahontas, a wise
chief and of course some careless Frenchies. And don't you think the
clichés just stop at character level, they run deep to include
predictable plots and extremely bromidic lines and dream sequences. I
don't mind that the story is a cliché revenge story, it's the treatment
that concerns me. The Revenant is basically about a man who wastes two
precious hours of our lives looking for another man who killed his son
and left him for dead, and when he finally finds him, the evil man's
dying words are revenge is no good. The end. That's it, I swear. If you
can see something beyond that, please feel free to contact me.3) I don't usually like to dwell on this point in my film reviews but
the improbability of the events was pointless and so difficult to
ignore. So we have a man who is fatally attacked by a grizzly bear,
almost smothered to death, shot at, falls down a waterfall and off a
cliff, stabbed and beaten (I hope I didn't forget anything), yet he
miraculously survives! I expect to see him in the next Avengers movie.4) Number four is not really a shortcoming but a disaster redeemed. The
outstanding performance by all the cast members makes up for the one
dimensionality of the roles they play. Domnhall Gleeson and Tom Hardy
hit all the right notes with exceptional maturity (even though I
thought Hardy's Texan accent was a bit funny, but maybe on purpose?).
Both are actually growing on me in a speed of light. DiCaprio was
amazing as usual but I don't think this is the performance he should
get an Oscar for. I do appreciate all the trouble and the physical pain
he had to go through but compared with his other performances I'm
sorry Leo, you can do much better. Anyways, if he grabs an Oscar this
year, he would still deserve it, retroactively.The music and the sound editing in general were annoying. I would've
sufficed with DiCaprio's incessant heavy breathing.. which is equally
annoying to be honest.Go watch Cast Away instead. If you have seen it already, watch it
again it would still be a more enjoyable experience.

This movie is only good for the scenery. If you want two and a half
hours of scenery and seeing a man grunting and crawling, you should
watch this movie. If you value your time and want to watch something
worth watching in your two and a half hours avoid this movie. After one
and a half hours the same person is still crawling and groaning and
breathing heavy. I edited it as so many scenes take so much time and
there is nothing but scenery. Then you get back to groaning and
crawling. This movie should have been a 45 minute movie but it is a
painstaking two and a half hours. Go to the last 30 minutes after the
first 30 minutes and maybe it is a redeemable movie. This movie is so
boring that an insomniac will fall asleep with all of the groaning and
snoozing and grunts. I could easily edit this movie to 30 minutes and
nothing would be lost and at 30 minutes it would be interesting. I must
give this the worst movie of the year award and it should have gone
straight to CD not even DVD. I can't understand how many people like
this movie. The story is better than movie and takes much less time to
read.

Unbelievable bad movie!I mean come on, i watched Titanic, and the same guy dies of Hypotermia
in 5 minutes of cold water!!!***spoiler*** Now he not only sleeps on the snow while totally ruined
and left to death after a bear attack, he crawls for miles, take swims
in a river with snow and ice around, get outside, sleeps a bit more
then make a fire from a spark, on the snow, then kill some, then fall
off the cliff with a horse and then he shows that he knows how Han Solo
saved Luke on planet Hoth from dying.It could be such a good movie if bear killed him at the start. Or at
least i wouldn't have wasted so much time watching it...

Awful movie. The worst one i watched this year...(so far). I can't
imagine how sick and perverted someone must be to make such a crappy
and repulsive film?! Average scenario, flat dialogues, no acting game
at all....just rivers of blood everywhere. Too much for my taste, and
also for the tastes of many people in the cinema theater - today half
of them just left after the first disgusting scene ....and they were so
many of them! What was the idea of the movie - some kind of exotic
punishment for the audience?! I think "The Revenant" is appropriate for
people who love blood, aggression and killings, but it is not for
mentally sane people. Watching this movie was totally waste of my time.

Technical achievements aside, The Revenant is a pretty hollow and
depressing experience. Lacking diversity in tone and exploiting a
unique combination of time period and environment to tell a tired
revenge narrative. The story is too basic to be set against such a
complex backdrop. You've got colonial politics, genocide, a civil war
(Which wasn't even brought up until the third act) and yet at the
centre, the emotional core, all there is is just a revenge movie. No problem with that at all. It is a problem though when it's a matter
of KFC being served on silverware. The best this film can provide is to
watch poor Leo suffering for an hour for the pleasure of people who
don't want to sit through the Oscars. When I see rape used as a cynical attempt at an audience pop, I know
then this is not my kind of film. That being said, the biggest pop from
the audience i was with was when Hardy's character had his fingers cut.
This is from a film featuring such highlights as a one shot bear
mauling, graphic arrow injury detail and all other types of
contemporary award bait. Finger chopping. That's what did it for people
and that was because Hardy was the most interesting thing in this
hawkish misery. A character, not a plot device or a motivation, but a
character, with layers. What a luxury! It's so sad that it's usually the little things messed up during Oscar
season. Puts the work of so many talented craftsman to waste. In short,
i did like The Revenant, in the cut they chose to release. It was
passable. But considering it's ambition, so painfully evident on
screen, passable just isn't good enough.

This film was no doubt my most anticipated of the year. Even if it
trumped my expectations by a mile it wouldn't have been far off from a
masterpiece. After viewing the multiple trailers several times each for
maximum analyzing, I knew it would be something incredibly special and
groundbreaking. It never ceases to amaze throughout. Scene after scene I was in awe of
the directors taught vision, the cinematographers beautiful eye, and
the casts brilliant immersion into their characters; which each and
every one breathed life into an already energized movie. Leonardo
DiCaprio does some fine work here, not his best because i think he's
already given his all to another role (The Wolf of Wall Street) but
nonetheless immerses himself completely in a role which you have never
seen him in before. It's quite a spectacle, all of it. And tom hardy will likely receive an
Oscar nod if not snagging one outright. Though I believe the real
winner here is the director; Alejandro Gonzalez Iniarritu, and
cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki. Both of which work together to bring
to life a living breathing painting which takes your breath away in
every sense of the word. I couldn't help but keep asking myself how
someone could make a film look so much better than anything I've ever
seen. Each shot is carefully choreographed and each sweeping camera angle
toggles between close and personal face shots and sweeping landscapes
that make you feel both elevated, and smothered. It blends very well
and makes for an experience I've never encountered. I just loved this movie and hope as many people can encounter it and
come to their own conclusions on it as I have. 10/10

Cinematography- Within 10 minutes it's clear why this is an obvious
win. No movie,in a long time, let alone this year has looked as
strikingly beautiful.Director- Alejandro Inarritu has again proved his ability to make a
movie both beautiful and entertaining. He's able to craft a great
story, getting the best from his actors against the backdrop of
beautiful scenes.Actor- Leo DiCaprio again delivers a top notch performance proving he
is one of the best actors of his generation. The fact that he hasn't
won yet proves what a joke the Oscars are. DiCaprio plays Glass, who
after a vicious attack is not only abandoned to die but must witness
the demise of his only son. Braving a never ending barrage of Indian
attacks and the unimaginably cruel elements of Mother Nature while he
struggles to survive and return home. (Tobe fair, Matt Damon might have
been a little better I The Martian, but it's Leo's time).Supporting Actor- Tom Hardy's performance is the true standout of the
film, as he is actually much better in his role than Leo is in his, and
that isn't a knock on Leo's performance it's just that Hardy was that
good. Hardy plays Fitzgerald, a cold blooded, perpetually angry ex-
Texas military man who is outraged by the mere presence of Glass (the
expeditions scout) and his half Native American son. After the attack
on Glass Fitzgerald takes it upon himself to decide Glass's fate & the
fate of any man who would stand in his way. The strolls into town to
collect the money owed him for doing right by Glass. All in all Hardy
plays the role of a scumbag perfectly and shows a true mastery of his
craft I scenes where he discusses his scalping and his father's view on
God. It is a true shame that Stallone will probably win for nostalgic
reasons when Hardy was truly the best.I don't think it should win best picture or screenplay since it does
get a little muddled and slightly repetitive in the middle, but still a
fantastic movie that really makes you appreciate how easily we, as a
whole, have it.

I've grown weary of these "I am man therefore invincible" movies. The
cast of this film is all male, aside from one female thrown in so she
can be raped.I know this film is based on a true story, a man who survived this sort
of overwhelming circumstances. But, really, all of this is true?
Nevertheless, the film doesn't provide enough back-story (aside from
his visions of his wife/partner dying and other odd visions). I don't
know who he is (the main character). I don't know who Tom Hardy is -
why is he such a jerk? Basically there is no character development or
back-story on anyone. The only moments I "felt" anything are when
((SPOILER)) his son is being murdered by Tom Hardy and when the Native
woman is being raped. Otherwise the film is a grueling series of
violent (bordering on ridiculous the amount of situations that arise)
circumstances over and over and over again until the final bloody end.I need character development, some story line, some reason to care
about anyone. This movie, to me, has absolutely no soul. No moral
compass. Is Leo's character a good guy because he's sad about his son
and saves a native woman from nonstop rape? I guess that means he's a
good guy.There are beautiful visuals of nature, nice cinematography. The bear
scene is well done and feels so real even though the bear is CGI. Leo
does a good job acting (grunting mostly). But this movie lacks soul.
Lacks characters. Lacks everything except nonstop violence.I could have left this movie several times, and come back to
essentially the same scene for the entire duration of the film
(near-dead man somehow enduring and soldiering on to his next
near-death experience).I found this film dreadful, tiresome and lazy story telling. If this
wins Best Picture there is something wrong with our culture.

Essentially a remake of the 1971 "Man In The Wilderness" starring
Richard Harris as Zachary Bass (Hugh Glass) and John Huston as Captain
Henry, although this version is said to be based on the 2002 novel of
the same name by Michael Punke. That said however, the real-life story
of the mountain man, Hugh Glass, is well-known in Western lore.Visually, "Revenant" is stunning and markedly superior to the 1971
version - as is to be expected with the advances in cinematography in
the intervening 45 years - but dramatically it's pretty poor fare when
compared to "Man In The Wilderness". DeCaprio doesn't even come close
to capturing the gaunt suffering of Harris's Zachary Bass and Domhnall
Gleeson's performance is pretty pallid compared to the craggy awfulness
of John Huston' Captain Henry. Pity, it's such a great story.

The Revenant (2015) directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu is about
survival in the extreme wilderness. It's also about: revenge, a man
coming back from the dead, a historical interpretation of the first
settlers in America with the French and Americans encroaching upon
Native American territories, and an exploration of what it means to
live, and why we live?Watching this is a completely different experience from Iñárritu's last
movie, Birdman (2014). Whereas the majority of Birdman was shot in
narrow spaces with tight frames following around the central
protagonist through narrow corridors and the backstage  which created
a feeling of claustrophobia  here it's the complete opposite. The
Revenant creates is expansive, with a lot of wide shots and sweeping
images of nature, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, the woods, and
demonstrates the awesome power of nature in comparison to humans. In
some ways the Revenant reminded me of another of my favorite, Terrence
Malick's Tree of Life (2011), particularly in the way sometimes
beautiful random shots of nature interjects the film for a few seconds,
but unlike that movie, Revenant contains a cohesive narrative structure
that's much easier to follow. (Note: turns out my instincts were
correct on the visual resonance to The Tree of Life. On checking IBDb
it turns out that the cinematographer for this movie is Emmanuel
Lubezki, who was also the director of photography for The Tree Life and
multiple other Terrence Malick projects.)My favorite parts of the movie contained shots of nature where a
character, usually Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) was alone in the
wilderness. They were without any dialogues, accompanied by just the
sound of nature like a roaring waterfall, or sound of melting snow from
treetops, or instrumental sounds (especially the drum beats) evoking
something very primal. The use of drums in a few key scenes during the
later half of the movie, sounded like it did in Iñárritu's Birdman
(must be his signature style). Although, I think it's far more
effective in The Revenant, since sound is used so sparingly that when
it is utilized, you pay attention. For example, the thumping of the
drums reminded me of racing heartbeats during crucial moments of life
and death.In this movie, the director constantly experiments with perspectives
and innovative camera-work. A lot of the perspectives in this movie is
really unusual. In the beginning, during an important battle, I found
the camera angle so unsettling  it felt like the viewer was a child,
standing very close and looking up to the characters. The shots were
taken from the waist, and from an uncomfortably close proximity, as
arrows flung, and people fell to their deaths unexpectedly. Also, a lot
of the violence in the movie is captured from up-close that it looks
real, and the viewers also experience the pain, shock, and surprise.
This is a visceral, immersive cinematic experience. I also appreciated
the fact, that you can literally see the camera lens get foggy when the
camera zooms in at least 3- 4 from what I counted, and the viewer knows
that it's really, really cold in actuality and the shot is not some CGI
trick. I loved the soundtrack; combined with the visuals, it's probably
the best marriage between video and audio I have heard in a long time.
The Native American languages spoken in this movie, also sounded very
melodic to me.The cinematography with it's sweeping landscapes, and the exceptional
soundtrack need to be experienced on a big screen to appreciate the
grand scale of nature. If you are a student of photography, you will
love this movie. I was so engrossed in the visuals of this movie,
particularly the landscapes, and the way the cinematography captures
the changing seasons that I kept missing some minor events that were
happening to the characters in the movie.For full review see:

I heard of this movie before i went to see it.. and as everyone said it
is a great film I where really looking forward to see it (especially as
the trailer is quite good).Well after I have watched it now, I have to say this movie is one of
the worst I have ever seen! It is unbelievable long (the boring way of
long) and there are more logical errors than in all movies I have
watched before combined. This features superhuman strengths, sudden
changes in depletion level and more.Everyone who knows a little bit about survival and bush-crafting will
have the strong desire to leave the cinema instantly.So from my side: Don't waste your time, don't watch this one

Don't listen to what anyone says about this movie. It's bad... I liked
all the actors playing in this movie, I'm a real fan of all leonardo
dicaprio's movies. I loved Tom Hardy In "peaky blinders". And I like
the performance of Will poulter in "we are the millers" and "maze
runner". Like always they didn't disappoint. On the other hand this movie is depressing aaaalll the way. I don't say
every movie should have a happy ending. But at least give us a reason
to watch this movie besides beautiful panorama shots of the
environment. The build up to action is to slow and when the action
finally comes it's banal. No captain would go after a deserter alone
with a wounded man! Without spoiling any further about the movie. I thought it sucked
really bad and I want the world to know about it! yours sincerely a
moviefanat who made an account on IMDb just to trash this movie.

This review is not to take away from any who enjoyed the movie, there
are many on both sides of the fence certainly. I merely represent the
lowest end of the curve.I truly feel that a monumental emphasis on acting, scenery, and filming
cannot come anywhere near salvaging a hollow shell of a movie that
truly contains so little plot, character development, or soul.I recommend this movie for those who are solely interested in the
visual sense, and who can accept a constant barrage of negative emotion
that shall remain unfulfilled and rather unjustified.Detailed Review, with some spoilers:Coming out at a time with more clever promotion and mystique than any
movie not named Star Wars, this movie was destined to be a big draw. It
stars 2 of the best actors in Hollywood, and is directed by a man who
cannot seem to lose at the biggest of award ceremonies. Not to mention
constant emphasis on the unique and agonizingly difficult way in which
the movie was filmed. Labelled as a thrilling story of survival, who
would give this a miss?The movie starts off with a bang for some, but in truth it is merely a
graphic bloodbath that provides little context. There are random arrows
flying through the skulls of countless individuals, random butchering
of a horse here and there, and very little dialogue. The only reason
you know that Leo and Tom are the leads, is because they are not doing
something silly like running out into the clearing alone (only to be
horribly slaughtered), or staying back and killing their own horses
rather than trying to escape this death trap! It is horribly
unrealistic, like a bad horror movie minus any form of comedic
undertone.You gain some context after the first scene, where the situation is
explained, and literally one character is developed: Tom Hardy. He is
the only prominent talking character. A very selfish man who is willing
to commit the most despicable deeds for money or survival. One of these
deeds leads to the "story of revenge". At this point, the other main
character (Leo) has said or done very little. We simply know he has a
young, clearly half-native son at his side. A good vendetta will
develop characters with a fundamental difference, both wielding
charisma on opposite sides of the spectrum. This particular vendetta is
slapped together in a very rushed manner, as the revenge plot seems
secondary to the amount of time spent on survival. This movie merely
uses a heinous action to create the necessary vendetta, and overly
heinous it is. I found my tastes starting to sour at this point simply
because the substance around the incident was very weak and the movie:
otherwise pessimistic and brutal. There had been little to no character
development, the charisma level was atypically low for Tom Hardy, and
Leo may as well have not even been there (prior to the start of his
desperate survival tactics). The acting was just fine, simply put the
roles provided no vessel for charisma to this point.Ironically, this story of revenge is the only thing that makes Leo any
form of real life character other than a mumbling, groaning, foaming
vegetable trying to keep himself alive. After the famous bear attack,
which simply occurs like everything else, (randomly), it is one
unrealistic survival after another. This includes a whole lot of
facial/verbal agony, for which he will likely win all of the awards.
The so called "story of revenge" remained as unfulfilling as any part
of the movie. Along the way, there is a whole lot more violence, and
the odd little story line which typically ends in butchery. The
overlying theme: one brutal incident after another without end, and a
whole lot of moaning. You could literally walk away for half of the
movie, come back having missed almost nothing, and be introduced to
everything this movie has to offer right away.The development of any relatable emotion occurs either through horror,
or pity. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat, merely wondering
how much more of this I am able to watch. Any attempt at a moral or
message was very poorly embedded.The filming and scenery are clearly the bright spots, but this to me is
simply like putting grains of sand in a tiffany's box. They have the
most expensive packaging, a pretty bow, and the best salespeople, but
no product. The unnecessary effort in shooting, and the ordeal the
actors went through is baffling to me, but clearly not to the critics.
I believe Innaritu could re-master the film "Waterworld" and win 12
awards if he so chose.As a follow up to "Birdman" I cannot help but find irony. If nothing,
Birdman criticized big budget violent movies that inevitably become
very successful. Critics pan them, Actors become typecast, the public
eats up mindless violence and thrills. Not only was this one of the
most violent/brutal movies ever made, I would argue that there is FAR
less brainwave activity or cause within this movie, than one of the
dozen Avenger series movies. This movie has already attained critical
acclaim, the main actors are in no danger of becoming typecast, and a
large portion of the public likes this movie. You tell me: Is Inarritu
an oblivious, fraudulent, King Midas where everything he touches turns
to gold...or is he one of the smartest men in Hollywood who knew how to
turn the table in an ironic fashion within this film?

It's a stupid movie Leonardo is a combination of the hulk, superman and
others A real human being died at least 5x in this film Bitten by a
bear, extremely wounded, he stands up and walks (without GPS) to his
village, haunted by several clans of Indian's (stupid Indian's, so much
people and they can't catch 1 man even when he steals their horses)
With the skin of a grizzly bear on his body he swims in an ice river
Imagine : the weight of this skin on his body and he swims a long
distance ! Imagine he swims an hour (maybe longer) in an ice river! And
then he stands up, totally wet and walks through the forest in ice and
snow A really stupid movie, but nice made a movie for people who loves
the simple Hollywood vision

Considering the fantastic reviews and prizes this film is getting I
have to say it is not my cup of tea. Great cinematography, good actors,
impressive fight with a bear, savage scenes...But what about a good
story or better said a new way of telling a story? To say the story is
conventional is an understatement. It reminds me of Dance with Wolves
when I would like to see something like the wronged The Hateful Eight.
The film leads you into thinking you are seeing something new because
of the unusual beautiful scenery and the savage ways of the
characters.It is like a candy in a new wrapping, when you open it is
all the same...

So this is the big film that Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to finally
win an Oscar for, well, time will tell I guess but I don't think it's
on of the best films I've seen him in and I'll happily not watch this
again if I can help it. Not by any stretch of the imagination an awful
film but it's loooooong, and not much happens for the bulk of the film.
It's absolutely one of those films I had to watch but will happily
never watch again. DiCaprio is part of band of fur trappers, he has an Indian son (sorry,
native American son). Much like "Saving Private Ryan" the opening of
the film is rammed full of action. The fur trappers come under attack
by a native American tribe (Indians). A lot of the fur trappers are
killed, some escape - obviously the big names in the cast are the lucky
ones; DiCaprio, Hardy, Poulter, Gleeson etc. After escaping the
trappers need to head back to their base, unfortunately DiCaprio gets
mauled by a grizzly bear and practically killed. It looks like DiCaprio
is going to die (a vision we are treated to a lot in this film) so
Hardy, Poulter and DiCaprio's son stay to stand watch with the plan to
bury him when he passes away and then join the others heading back.
Hardy decides to try and speed things up, he tries killing DiCaprio but
the Indian son catches him at it and tries to stop which results in him
actually being offed by Hardy instead (witnessed by a near dead
DiCaprio). Hardy tells Poulter a few lies and convinces him to leave
the body so they trundle off. At this point feel free to go make
yourself a strong coffee or two, you'll need them and you won't miss
much (unless you like trees). Alone and near death DiCaprio drags
himself through the frozen wild frontier, he gets chased, shot at,
followed, even falls off a cliff and sleeps in his horse (much like
Luke Skywalker sleeping in a TaunTaun) on his adventure back home to
seek revenge against Hardy for killing his son. There are a lot of
flashbacks to try and make the audience feel something for DiCaprio but
like the others in the film character development is missing and the
flashbacks that there are don't serve to give the characters much
depth. Equally there are a lot of long shots of nature and in
particularly trees... lots of shots of trees: trees standing still,
trees swaying, trees that are big, trees that are small, trees in the
dark, trees in the light, trees with snow, some trees with leaves,
trees, trees, trees. After each near death experience DiCaprio manages
to find strength to continue like a rubbish superhero that just can't
die. To cut a long story short he gets back to home base only to find
that Hardy has cracked a near impossible safe, stolen a shed load of
money from the captain of the trappers base and left to be rich south
of the border somewhere warm. Rather than a whole troop of trappers
hunting down Hardy to get their money back DiCaprio and Gleeson decide
to go alone. They find Hardy, Gleeson dies and DiCaprio engages in a
fight to the death with Hardy. The end, thank God for the credits. The acting in the film is authentic enough although it does sound like
Hardy has a mouthful of chewing tobacco inhibiting his speech, for the
most part of the film he has the most lines while DiCaprio probably got
paid per moan and groan. The pace of the film isn't great, maybe it's a
conscious decision to be symbolic of the wide open spaces, but, maybe
it's not and I'm just hoping there was a clever decision behind the
long/wide shots of trees and more trees. Noticeably the film is dark, I
don't mean dark like a good horror/slasher film, I mean dark like dirty
and dimly lit. You could probably cut this film up and make a great
action packed hour long feature but instead you'll have to sit through
the best part of 3 hours of not much happening. It's a case of style
over substance for a lot, and the style that stands out if the
cinematography, maybe the cameraman should be the Oscar nominee rather
than DiCaprio because some of the swooping shots are quite clever. I've
mentioned that the opening of the film is like "Saving Private Ryan"
and "Star Wars: Empire strikes back"; other comparisons I could make it
"Apocalypto" as it's a constant journey (difference being I enjoyed
watching that film more than once and despite the language barrier I
understood what the characters were saying) and maybe "I spit on your
grave" because DiCaprio is tortured constantly yet still manages to
pull himself together to seek revenge (albeit he avoids being raped). So, ratings, I'd struggle to give this more than 6 out of 10. Don't get
me wrong, I'm not a film expert but I do have a qualification in film
studies so can appreciate some of the work the crew have put into this.
However I'm also no fool, this wasn't a fun vehicle for suspension of
disbelief and I wasn't entertained and on the edge of my seat at any
time - even the bear mauling could have been nastier. Thanks for the
experience, but I've done it once and thankfully don't have to do it
again. A long film does not always make a good film, I wish the bear
had of being successful because then maybe I could have avoided
watching trees swaying, trees standing still, tall trees and short
trees, trees, trees, trees, trees.

first of all it is pretty long movie !for that they don't talk much
!the story is very good to unbelievable to yeah sure that's so
realistic (sarcasm) to now the fairytale is getting involved ...and to
many story lines where trying to be put together but there was no
connection no meaning ... ! i never seen a crowd leaving a theater so
quiet as in this movie mixed feelings shock some kind of disgusted ..?i
guess at least that is what i was feeling .it seems like a very
desperate last try from DiCaprio going for an Oscar ...? sadly as it is
i didn't find he bend over backwards to show something special to the
viewer .now to the parts i really loved is the stunning camera captures
of the action parts the amazing view of nature and the tips and tricks
how to survive !anyways go watch it but be aware if you have a
sensitive stomach !

I just finished reading a series of commentaries by people giving this
movie a single star. Take your hatred elsewhere. If you didn't like the
film, fine, but because it got hype, it's not your job to lower its
rating; it's your obligation to say something intelligent about the
filmmaking. This is one of the most visually striking features I've
ever seen. The camera angles and the framing of the scenes is
spectacular. During the first scene ambush, we get to see what it must
be like to suddenly be in the middle of a maelstrom. Arrows are
frequently seen as sterile in most films. Here, we get a taste of them
being a kid of artillery. LIke "Deliverence," which is another
unsettling film, these guys are just in the wrong place. Whether those
furs were worth a lot or not, all their work wasn't worth it. Yet, from
what we hear, they are people who are the dregs of society and need
something to keep them going. Yes, when DeCaprio shows up, we began to
see men who, despite their oaths, will look after their own butts.
Honor only goes so far in this universe. The story of Hugh Glass is
part of history. I, like many others, question the extent to which this
guy is pushed to the limits (a lot of Hollywood gimmickry). It takes
some real skill to deal with real historical figures. I doubt that a
third of this happened. I do know that Hugh Glass was mauled by a bear
and that he literally crawled across three states to get revenge. Had
he been totally fictional, we would be much more forgiving. In this
case, less would have been more, with some compactness and restraint. I
will leave it to the experts to get at the technical stuff. This is a
highly entertaining film. Anyone that gives it one star is just being
spiteful. I suppose they don't like DeCaprio. One even criticized the
fact that it took place in the early 1800's.

If you can tolerate the exaggeration of the survival capacity of a
human being, romantic dreams during extreme violence, unbreakable
bones, non-infectious scars, ultimate resistance to hypothermia etc.,
then this movie could be watched as pastoral symphony of winter scenes.
There are impressive wilderness shots like the struggle with the bear,
buffalo herd with the wolves etc., but these are not very original and
difficult with today's technology. Leonardo DiCaprio played better
roles than this one and I think he has already deserved an Oscar. Art
direction, sound mixing and editing are excellent. Photography is
outstanding. Unnecessarily long and boring.

This is another film where visually it is brilliant, the acting is
really good but let down by an unsatisfying story. Another film where
millions are spent on locations, costumes, actors, CGI.However, they go to poundland for the script. It's a watch once but I doubt you will bother enduring the 133 minutes
a second time.If you've seen 'Jeremiah Johnson' with Robert Redford this has similar
mountain men/wilderness/Indian realism. Quite possibly the makers are
trying to emulate Jeremiah Johnson. Similarities end there, Jeremiah Johnson has a really strong story and
is a classic film of the genre.The Revenant is badly let down by the script. Which is a shame. It had
everything else going for it.Tom Hardy is exceptional and in my opinion far outshines De Caprio.
(and De Caprio does a good job in the film) Main aspects plot/script aspects that spoil, what visually was a great
film, are 1. de Caprio badly mauled by a bear, leg/ankle broken, chunks out of
his flesh to the bone. So badly injured that his companions give him
hours to live. He cannot move or speak. Not even when Tom Hardy offers
to kill him. Not even when Tomy Hardy decides to suffocate him anyway.
Not even when Tom Hardy sticks a knife in De Caprios Indian son. Yet rapidly through the film he has the healing capabilities of
Wolverine. Even flowing down an icy river for some time clutching a log. I'm not a
survival expert, but doesn't being immersed in icy water kill even a
fit and healthy man in minutes? But I forget we are dealing with
Wolverine. 2. De Caprio has an Indian son late teens early twenties, who
accompanied his tough 'mountain man' father on the expedition. Yet
despite his upbringing, massacres n such. When the son 'hawk' finds a
man trying to murder his father, his reaction is more like a vicars
wife. As a result he is very easily killed. Very implausible. The son is a rather pointless character other than for De Caprio's
'flashbacks' to his Indian wife, who was killed in a massacre. 3. If they had spent 15 of the 133 minutes showing De Caprio the family
man. With his happy Indian family of wife and son and their demise. The
flash backs may have more relevance. It could also have explained the
otherwise pointless mentions of how 'De Caprio' killed an officer. 4. Numerous rather meaningless (because we have been given no real info
on this subplot) 'flashback'/visitations of his dead Indian wife.
Ripping of Russell Crowe's dreams in Gladiator?5. The initial attacking Indians are searching for the chiefs daughter.
Apparently she was stolen at some stage by 2 nasty white men. We see
these same Indians trading with French trapers and finally receiving 5
of the French traders horses to assist the Indians in their search. Later, a now much revived de Caprio, comes across the same French
trappers. One of which is raping the daughter. De Caprio, whilst
stealing a horse helps her (the chiefs daughter) escape from the French
trappers. .............................What?6. When De Caprio finally reaches the fort. The Captain wants to go out
alone and get Tom Hardy. (Who has run off --- the little rascal) De
Caprio even in his wounded condition insists on going with the Captain
in pursuit. The fort is presumably manned by soldiers, of which
presumably the Captain is one. There are certainly plenty of men with
guns. Why did they not take more men? have a posse? Then the poor Captain
would not have died. You'd think a military man, experienced in
fighting injuns', would have more savvy.7. At the end, the bad injuns finish off big bad Tom Hardy for De
Caprio. They then trot on by the wounded De Caprio, the chiefs daughter
gives him a final condescending look as she walks her horse past.Uhhh?Summary. : The film is watchable. It's not disastrous.In my opinion the film makers error was doing 133 minutes of man
struggles to survive after being mauled by a bear. (And makes a
remarkable recovery in a remarkably short space of time)Throwing in a few flashbacks is insufficient to show, that he did in
fact have a life, before he met the bear.

*** This review may contain MINOR spoilers ***This Review is dedicated to my student and dear friend, Luisa Bacca,
who has played a key role in focusing International Attention on the
rights of Indigenous peoples in Colombia, especially here in Nariño, as
a mediator in the ongoing Peace Process between the U.N. High
Commission on Human Rights and the Colombian Government! Leonardo DiCaprio, upon his acceptance of his Golden Globe, used the
occasion to express his concern for indigenous peoples and their
portrayal in movies. At the time, this seemed a bit difficult to put
into context, but now that I have seen the film, it is crystal! And I
think there are basically 2 ways to react to REVENANTA straight up,
grizzly (No Pun Intended!) true-story Man vs. Nature Action/Adventure,
take it exactly as it is reaction, or, an infinitely nuanced "This
Movie is a Metaphor" approachNeed it be said that I am most certainly
an Option B person!?!?That having been said, REVENANT is such an astoundingly overwhelming
experience, it is a tad difficult to decide on a starting point!
Director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu shows himself to be the
perfectionist he is via the numbing, jaw-dropping beauty of the filming
locations that provide the numerous impressive visual backdrops seen
throughout. The list of locations includes Tierra del Fuego, Mexico,
and various U.S. and Canadian ones! As to the veracity of the "True
Story" aspect of this harrowing tale, who knows? Wikipedia mentions
that Frontiersman Hugh Glass' (Definite Oscar-worthy performance by
Leonardo DiCaprio) life and accomplishments were often prone to
embellishments, and Punke's 2002 Novel apparently plays fast and loose
with the truth. Aside from just what IS true and what isn't, Gonzalez
Iñárritu has permeated every frame with a level of reality that is
truly chilling, both literally and figuratively! The U.S. was a relatively young country in the 1820's; A vast, mostly
untamed and rapidly expanding nation that had doubled its territory
just 20 years earlier through the Louisiana Purchase. REVENANT unfolds
clearly accentuating the uncertainties of life in the Missouri
Territory, where the only existing technological implement in your
daily existence was your firearmOh, and probably, in Captain Henry's
case, a pocket watch, one would imagine! Their fur gathering/trading
expedition comes under surprise attack (Was there any other kind back
then?) by considerable numbers of Arikara Indians, who consider their
actions as justified, since, in their opinion, it is the trading
expedition that is trespassing on Arikara territory.After both suffering and inflicting heavy losses, the expedition's
survivors manage to raft away to safety. After cautiously biding their
time on the river, they finally return to terra firma. Soon after, Hall
has his ill-fated encounter with a grizzly bear, who, instinctively,
simply was protecting her cubs. This scene is, quite honestly, spoiler-
proof! No written words could "ruin" it for you! It is a bone-chilling
vision that you really must experience for yourself! Most certainly,
you will be scratching your head, as I and most others were, wondering
"Just how in the hell did they do that?" Apparently, A Man In the
Wilderness (1971) was also inspired by Hugh Glass and his ordealBut I
never saw it! There is a 1972 film, which came to mind a few times
while viewing REVENANTJeremiah Johnson, A Sydney Pollack Classic with
Robert Redford in the title role!Some of you might be wondering, about now, if there will be any
reference to elements mentioned in this review's title. Not to worry!
My Review title should be "crystal", too, if you take the dualistic
viewing approach mentioned early on here. To avoid crossing the Spoiler
threshold, let it suffice to say that taking REVERANT in its entirety,
it seems to speak to putting our treatment of indigenous peoples in the
U.S. into some kind of more rational perspective. Personally, I found
the ending to be rather spiritual and upliftingMaybe it's just me!

I have now seen this film twice in four days and the second viewing
affirmed what I thought after the first, This is an exceptional piece
of cinema. The caveat to that is that folks who like to be spoon fed
their entertainment may find it difficult viewing in places but be
assured it is exceptional for a number of reasons in my view. Not least
the casting, from the Hollywood mega stars(Leo&Tom) to the relatively
unknown (to me) Native Americans. The other most important ingredient
is the setting, harsh in the extreme.. All played their roles superbly
with an unbelievable sense of the time in history when it is set as
much as we can really understand what life was really like then. I
would assume, pretty 'brutal' by the standards of modern western
society. I had no trouble hearing and understanding the dialogue but
often it was not greatly of consequence whether understood or not
because there is a continuous sequence of events which leads to a
fairly likely conclusion. On first viewing I did have a sense of
wondering what was going to happen next most of the way through and
unlike some reviewers I was not 'bored' for a moment, so much of what
occurred was so dramatic as to be a constant chain of surprises,
knowing from the meaning of the title what the final outcome would be.I
should point out that both viewings were on the biggest screen of my
local complex and I sit fairly near the front to get that totally
imersive experience.I don't know where the filming took place but
wherever, it was a good platform for early 19th century 'back of
beyond' USA and that coupled with the unrelenting precipitation of snow
or rain gave the whole thing a feeling of great authenticity.I have
noted one or two reviews have been very picky about details but for me
it was an outstanding piece of drama presented to the highest
production values in a staggeringly beautiful if somewhat bleak, at
times, setting. Not for watching on a phone or an ipad but as I said to
start with an exceptional piece of cinema with outstanding performances
from Leo and Tom especially.

Just to say a little, I watch a lot of movies. I know when a movie is
technically sound and when a script is mediocre. I was excited about
going to see this movie. Everything seemed interesting, DiCaprio, Tom
Hardy, Alejandro as director. However, this movie was not engaging
throughout the movie. The first 35 minutes of the movie are good, then
around the second act, it gets crucially dull, then the last 35 minutes
are good, but the plot of the script of this movie is not intriguing.
The movie could have been shorter and it would have been better in my
opinion. The characters were very flat, however, Tom Hardy's character
was by far the most multi-dimensional and characteristic. The
cinematography was astonishing in every aspect, the acting was great,
but the story was monotonous and slow paced. I would not recommend this
movie.

The best things about this movie are the beautiful scenery and
cinematography, the top-notch acting and some interesting dream
sequences. But what is it all for? Everyone knows the plot: Somebody
killed my (insert loved one) so I'm going to kill him. Have we not seen
this a thousand times? Is it really different when shot in the
wildernesses of Canada, Montana and Argentina? I almost walked out of
the movie after the bear mauling scene. Many have criticized this
scene, but what troubled me about it is that a supposedly experienced
woodsman would be unaware that you have to flee if you see bear cubs,
and if the bear attacks, you're supposed to lie still. Also from what I
know an experienced woodsman would be able to tell that a bear was in
the vicinity and would leave the area as soon as possible.The movie improved in the last half because the action heated up and
there was more dialogue. Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar and DiCaprio
deserves a Purple Heart. There was some minor drama involving a third
character. I'm just not sure this simple story deserved the enormous
amount of effort that went into making this film.

I think this movie is really overrated.The photography is great and the acting is good (i liked the Tom Hardy
performance, and I liked the Di Caprio one too, although I think he did
better performances in other movies).The plot is really inconsistent and not coherent at all, I do not want
to spoiler it but the first part of the movie is well built and
believable, the second part feels fake, the behaviour of the captain
has no sense and the final sequence remember more a super heroes movie
than a "true story" one...I don't wonder at all that the second part of the movie (and of the
book), the revenge one, totally divert from the real fact that inspired
the book.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I didn't know much about
it before I went to see it with my girlfriend but I knew it had Leo and
Tom Hardy in who I both really like so I was expecting a decent movie.It has enough to keep you interested right up until Leo becomes
incapacitated. Then it gets boring. Long and boring. Now don't get me
wrong, I thought the acting was very good but that doesn't do much for
me when the story line is dull and dragged out to no end. There are
certain scenes which seem to just be thrown in there - like the dreams
he has of his wife... I'm not sure if those dreams were meant to be the
things that were helping him fight on but I didn't get that impression.
Not much was given about the background of the characters so it was
hard to feel sympathy for them and in particular, there was barely any
relationship shown between him and his son, so when he dies it isn't as
sad as it could of been.The actual story line is the most basic of all time, I am baffled at
those who have said it is a great story line. Man seeks revenge for
murdered family member. Like that hasn't happened before... Then there
is the side story of the Native American looking for his daughter. It
felt like that was just thrown in there because viewers couldn't
concentrate on a 30 minute scene of Leo on his own so they thought they
could distract the viewer temporarily, before getting back to the quiet
dullness of the main plot.Everything just seemed to be slotted in, in a kind of 'oh by the way..'
fashion. No depth in any of the characters in my opinion. All that being said - my girlfriend said she liked it although agreed
the plot was poor. She liked the scenery and the acting. I agree with
her on those things, but it needs a half decent plot to bring it
together which unfortunately the film severely lacked.

I really enjoyed the Birdman, last year and I thought this year's
Alejandro G. Iñárritu's work would share some of its virtues... Alas...
Based or not on real events, this movie is a 2015 rendition of Rambo
II. The main differences are: It's a few decades later, Rambo is played
by Leonardo Di Caprio, the director won the Oscar last year, it's
located in the American wilderness in the winter, Rambo doesn't show
any muscles and (here comes the spoiler) he dies at the end.The similarities: Glass, the main character is almost immortal. He can
get attacked by hundred of (as it's not Vietnam in this case) Indians,
animals, can avoid bullets but kill in one shot everyone he needs.He is also left by his comrades to die, but yet, survives, heals
himself in the freezing cold and crawls back for revenge.Yes, this is a Hollywood movie with everything. A star in the main
role, lots of action, amazing visual effects, shootings and of course
the protagonist who can't die with anything... until the very end.
There is even a Boss fight at the end, as any good (or not) video game
ends with.In the positive side, Iñárritu is a very good director and his
technique is obvious in this movie as well. I liked the camera moving
from one character to the other as the fight goes on or as people move
around coming even too close to the camera. It was an interesting idea,
and an interesting modification with the Birdman's continuous camera
shooting, but keeping the signature distinct. Di Caprio has evolved to
a good actor, but I still believe his best role so far was in Django
unchained. In this case, for a large part of the movie he cannot walk
nor talk, which might give him the Oscar, as several actors who played
people with mobility or other issues, have got before.So, 3 stars only because the director is good. The story is long and
boring, the scenario uninteresting, the fight with a bear a big joke,
the healing in the winter also. I hope Iñárritu will give us something
good next year.

How many movies does this one steal from? Let me see. The attack at the
beginning is right out of 'Saving Priavte Ryan' with bows and arrows.
The scene where DiCaprio's character stays warm by gutting the horse he
was riding and sleeping inside it is right out of 'The Empire Strikes
Back', and I can almost hear the director saying 'Let's take that a
step further and have him actually sleep inside it!' Give me strength.
The whole theme of a GOOD WHITE MAN befriending Native Indians in 1800s
America is Dances With Wolves. In fact the whole time I was watching
this I couldn't help thinking the director was trying to recreate the
'magic' of Kevin Costner's 1990 film and God knows why, as it was
pretty schmaltzy to begin with! Then there are the ridiculous scenes in
which suspension of disbelief is stretched beyond many films I have
ever seen. I am fully aware that this is LOOSELY based on a true story
and that Hugh Glass (who DiCaprio plays) actually survived a bear
mauling and managed to find his way back to civilisation but in the
cinematic version of events we are asked to believe that he also was
dragged down a river in freezing temperatures for a few miles when his
body had already been put through the proverbial ringer and didn't
suffer hypothermia, that a horse he was riding leapt of a cliff with a
drop of around 150 feet and that the horse dies but he survives WITHOUT
BREAKING A SINGLE BONE. Really? Then there are the clichés. Dream sequences in which we see his now
dead wife, flashbacks to how she was killed.And the made up stuff. Why oh why do Hollywood-made films insist on
making up things in stories 'based on true events'?? There isn't just
artistic license here, the writers saw fit to give Glass a part Native
American son which he never had, just to have him killed and give his
character more reason to go after his killer. And that's another thing,
the real Hugh Glass didn't kill the guy because of the heavy penalty
for killing a U.S. soldier, which the guy was at the time.And there is the always irritating to me fact that they insist on
casting actors whose accents aren't the actors native ones ie Tom Hardy
is English so why cast him as an American? Especially an American in
the 1800s? Is he that much of a box office draw? I was quite excited to
see this because I loved 'Birdman' so much but this just reeks of a
filmmaker trying to attract Oscar attention. It reminds me of when
Michael Cimino was given free reign on 'Heaven's Gate' because 'The
Deer Hunter' was such a critical and Academy darling, although this is
a much better film than 'Heaven's Gate'. I'm giving it 5 stars because
of DiCaprio's acting and the absolutely stunning cinematography. The
music is quite good too.Oscar nominations? It deserves the following:Actor, Cinematography, Editing, Production Design, Sound Mixing, Sound
Editing

*warning may contain spoilers*I really do not understand the good reviews. I had to stop 3 quarters
into this joke of a movie. No story. Bunch of killings. The star
character (Dicaprio) has more souls than a cat. He gets mauled by a
bear yet can walk, talk, and survive. He survives with drenched clothes
in the freezing wilderness. He Flys off a cliff, and you guessed it,
still lives. I love Leo, and no words can describe my utter disappointment. The
story is non existent, only killing and killing and killing. One native
American looking for his daughter, one white man looking for revenge
maybe? Or just trying to survive, and another white crook who killed
his son. Spare yourself, unless nice shots and graphics is all you care about !

Maybe I am the first one to say this but this movie is god awful. If I
could give it a negative rating I would. I don't know when directors
got the notion that a long movie makes for a good movie. Whatever
became of good editing? I fell asleep watching Leo DiCaprio limp
through the snow for 2.5 hours. Sure it's a tale of fierce
determination, but really, it could have been told in 90 minutes with
no loss in quality or character development. I feel that the movie was
horrifically bad and would present a strong cure for insomnia. Out of
mercy's sake, I would volunteer to jump into the movie and shoot him
dead; to put him out AND the audience out of misery. Please note this
is not a death threat but only an improvement to the waning plot. The
movie is incredibly Hollywood-predictable to make me laugh out loud,
even if it's based on a true story.SPOILER ALERT: In retrospect, if I
saw this movie again, I would root for the bear. Hopefully the academy
has some sense and realizes that they should not agree that this is
good cinema just because that's what everyone else is saying...I say
that the emperor has no clothes!

Spur of the moment movie decision on a hot afternoon to go see the new
DiCaprio vehicle. If you are considering it DON'T! Do your self a favor
get toe fungus or diarrhea or something fun like that. If I EVER see
the directors name attached to another movie it will take some
persuading for me to watch it. The Revenant was possible the worst movie experience I have ever had.
The cinematography was painful disorientating far to much whirling
around at high speeds from the actors perspective, lots of trees and
sky. The dialogue was clichéd stilted and racist without any redeeming
quality.The storyline predicable dull there was no drama, the setting was
inconsistent one frame the poplar trees have their spring & summer
green foliage the next frame its gray snow covered ground middle of
winter with trees barren and blizzards at the drop of a hat. Lets look at the plot a man survives not one but two bear attacks in
the first 15 minutes. The producers would have had a better scenario
setting this movie on another planet or with aliens. Of course he
survives being being thrown into a grave a couple handfuls of soil with
MASSIVE internal injuries and NO cover in the middle of winter in
temperatures that freeze a a body solid not 20 feet away. I could go on
for hours but I'm not wasting any more of my life on this believe you
me it only gets worse! Every movie goer willing suspends belief in reality when entering a
theater. It's what we do to allow the magic of a movie to capture our
imaginations to inspire and entertain us. This movie insults, degrades
and then destroys that willingness in the first 20 minutes and then
gets worse. Its getting 1 for the scenery, stunning countryside shame it had to be
an unwilling participant in this travesty of movie making.

I HATED this movie... There aren't very many movies I can say that
about either. I couldn't understand a single word the southerners were
saying.. They had subtitles for all the other languages, I feel like I
needed it for English as well. That's not even the worst part about
it.. Everything was so random and just one thing after another, nothing
seemed to make sense! For some reason I have to give 10 lines, but try
not to give anything away.. I hate how movies, this one as well,
glorify rape. I hate how they show animals getting shot point blank.
This guy gets shot, he lives, he gets mauled by a bear, lives, gets
buried alive, lives, goes over a waterfall, lives.. I finally walked
out after the rape scene and wish I could get my money and time back.
It's 2.5 hours of worthless trash.

Here comes 3 hours movie in 10 sentences:SPOILER ALERT: Plot: There is some fight between Indians and Americans. Leonardo got
into the fight. He also get attacked and wounded by the bear. His
friends left him alone. His son got killed. He somehow survives, eating
bones,leaves and fishes. He can make fire when ever he wants, never
mind, if snowing or he just came out of river. Then he met other
Indian, who helped him. But this Indian got killed by French guys. Then
Leonardo's horse got killed and has to sleep inside his horse. Then
spring comes, and he comes out of the dead horse. Then they found him.
Then he chased the guy, who killed his son. And that's pretty much all.

This film and is awful. The worst film I've ever seen in my whole life.
What is it even about? Leonardo crawling about the snow after being
attacked by a bear and getting his son killed. Crawling about injured
half dying like a smack head from drumchapel shopping centre eating
creatures and raw fish. Then miraculously gets strength to fight back
and kill people to get revenge for his sons death that he caused in the
first place. Nah tom hardy should have gutted him like the pikey he is
and left him not even bothered to finish him never mind be kind enough
to dig him a grave. I was looking forward to this film and am so
disgusted I wish bear grylls would jump out a tree and rip leonardos
face off hope tom hardy finishes the job. Leonardo should have just let
the bear finish him and then his son would not have died. I have a new
ending.......leonardo is attacked by the bear and everyone else just
eats him and lives happily ever after x

Immediately forgettable, because no emotional connection is established
between the characters and audience. As you are watching, you find
yourself asking "Why isn't this working?" and, as you walk out of the
theater, you're still wondering "Why?" One answer is the characters are
single dimensional; another, the editing is confused, chopped. A third,
scenes of nature, the outdoors, environment, locale, etc that should be
integral to the emotions, but are not evocative, and seem to have been
filmed, then interspersed periodically for no reason and to little
effect. David Lean could use the locale to tell the story. This
director cannot or does not. Im sorry to say these things, because I
was really looking forward to the movie.

It should win an Academy Award for realistic looking cinematography. I
kept thinking this was going to eventually be a great movie because it
looked so good.After awhile I realized it was a tired old script: Cowboys and Indians;
kidnapped daughter; killed son; Revenge; Blood and guts and suffering;
Leo is the only one who has a GPS in his head.There was no need to waste so much talent and money making this film.
You could watch a medical surgery flick or attend a hospital's
Emergency Room on a Saturday night and achieved the same result.This is line #10 which is required. I've run out material.

I truly hoped to finally enjoy a decent outing at the movies. I haven't
seen a decent flick at the cinema in over a year. 2015 was very painful
for a fan of the silver screen with such duds as Black Mass, Crimson
Peak and Sicario all previewed with that ol' Miramax feel, a brand of
underground hits from the 1990's which featured great casts and crew. I
also was duped into the Hollywood hype-train flicks like Ant Man,
Jurassic World and The Martian... Lord knows I was finally going to get
a decent flick here with Leo and Hardy, even though Inarritu's Birdman
was pure garbage, IMO. Unfortunately, this ain't happening, not today.
Without spoiling anything vital to the story. I will say that you will
see an exact copy of the early scene in Saving Private Ryan at the
beaches of Normandy, only this time it will feature cowboys (fur
traders) vs Indians. You will see Leo saved from brutally cold weather
in the belly of a Tauntaun like in The Empire Strikes Back, I'm sorry I
meant Luke saved in the belly of a horse!? I will also say that you
will see Tom Hardy do a completely outstanding job of emulating the Tom
Berenger role in Platoon, however, in this flick he will be rolling
around in the snow and the scar will be worn on his scalp, not on his
face. Kudos to Hardy cause he really sounded like Sgt. Barnes. Hardy
enjoying a smoke off a pipe really sealed the deal for me. I will also
say that this script has the same revenge motif used several times
before, primarily in Braveheart and Gladiator. The end result is a ton
of wasted scenes featuring snowy mountains, snowy trees and snowy
rivers, all of which seemed like they were stolen from, or at the very
least, inspired by Godfrey Reggio. Needless to say, I could easily see
Leo signing on to this Inarritu project after the Birdman hype because,
Hey! if he could get Michael Keaton a best actor award... Bottom line,
a bunch of pretentious garbage by Hollywood and their new favorite hack
director.

OK..... where to start.... If you know nothing about movies and have no
prior history of film history, then you'll think this is an awesome,
gripping and original movie.... But.... if you've seen Jeremiah
Johnson, A Man Called Horse, Dances with Wolves, .... and can place
them in context/their time you can cleary see this script is a total
ripoff of those movies (eventhough it seems to be based on a book) and
only has the great camera-work going for it. Those other movies were
groundbreaking and had phenomenal actors. This one is not, but young
moviegoers will probably be fooled. DiCaprio really tries to prove
himself as a great actor in this movie, I'll give him that.... but he
fails miserably.... proving he doesn't come close to the likes of
Robert Redford, Newman, Brando,.... not by a long shot... Christian
Bale might have kicked ass in this role though.... And the worst of
all, I kid you not, without giving a spoiler away, there's an entire
scene that comes straight from The Empire Strikes Back!!!!! Watch the
movie and you'll see, it's so obvious.....At least they should have made some "Thanks to" or "Inspired by
viewing".... acknowledgments...Sorry, but no thanks. the movie as such was certainly not bad if you
don't take the above into account, but doesn't stand by its own at all
and is just a mix of great (old) movies ripped off without giving them
the merrit they deserve. No thanks..... On the bright side, Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy were excellent.

The above mentioned caption is the highlight of the movie. Reason for
watching this movie was only one. Leonardo got the Oscars for the very
first time after being nominated for 6 times. But but but.. wrong movie
and character to get him the big Oscar. A very simple revenge story .
Dialogue writer(s) had nothing to write for Leonardo. the movie tried
to cash in on Leo only. Camera work was not good. Whole time the camera
was on the faces of the characters . Or the things which were in the
movie.The survival of Leonardo was not logical after getting so much
hurt(completely dead). Only 4 recognizable characters in the movie
which you forget also, few minutes after the movie ended. Leo , Tom ,
Bear , AND the wallpapers(cinematography of sun , moon , trees , ice )
shown in the movie. Last word : didn't like it after so much hype.

The Revenant is an intense but excruciatingly long film. It recounts
the true story of the incredible return of Hugh Glass, an ace fur
trapper, who was left behind as "dead" by a treacherous accomplice
after being badly mauled by a bear. Without subtitling, barely a
sentence can be understood of the heavily accented drawl. Not that
Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hugh Glass has much to say; most of the
time he is grunting or grimacing. Other than that he also bites into
live fish, eats raw bison liver and sleeps inside a dead horse. It is
definitely not an Oscar winning performance.While the snowscape is exquisitely photographed, it can hurt your eyes.
There are some stunning sequences, among them the bear attack. Despite
the film being so long, not much footage has been devoted to Glass's
miraculous recovery. It defies belief, even if based on a true
incident. The director has tried to inject some doses of mysticism, but
it comes across as a pompous exercise in film-making. What linger at
the end are not the travails of Hugh Glass, but the sad eyes of the
native Indian chief searching for his abducted daughter.

Well acted and well photographed, yet unfocused, as it is told from
multiple perspectives (DiCaprio's, Hardy's, and the Native Americans) ,
while I think Hardy's character was much more interesting and
conflicted than DiCaprio's. Film turns DiCaprio's character into a sort of wilderness superhero,
able to survive being mauled by a bear (twice) , hypothermia, near
drowning, and, in the film's best scene, a fall from a great height
while on horseback. However, its dramatic effect is largely negated by
the fact that the scene was shown in the trailer. Even worse, by that
point in time, we are positive he will survive, considering all he has
already lived through. There's a difference between resilience, being determined to survive,
and being an indestructible (and unrelateable) superhero.

The trailers gave a strange impression for this movie. I did not have
many expectations."Was it entertaining?" The scenery is awesome, the action is
believable, and the sound and music great. Was a tad long, and story
meandered a bit. 2 out of 3."Was it interesting?" The camera work (especially in the action scenes)
was phenomenal. The acting is hard to judge since there isn't much
dialog for the length of film. 2 out of 3."Was it memorable?" The story didn't grab me as much as I wanted. It's
trying to be a survival movie and a revenge movie at the same time. I
think that's biting off too much. 1.5 out of 3.Starting with 1 (because numbers), 1+2+2+1.5=6.5Rounding up to 7. One of the best made movies in a long time. It's just
the characters and some of the story that need work.

When going in to see the latest film "The Revenant" from director
Alejandro González Iñárritu, one cannot forgo some certain expectations
that diverts your attention before the movie actually begins. You are,
in the least knowledgeable scenario, aware that it stars Leonardo
Dicaprio in the lead role. If you have been keeping up with cinema you
know the director's name and his previous Best Picture winner, Birdman;
further, if you if you have followed "The Revenant"'s production, you
would hear countless stories of the troubles the crew faced shooting in
sub-zero temperatures on natural locations, with all-natural lighting,
and perhaps you would hear how Leonardo Dicaprio had to eat a real
buffalo liver on camera. Beyond what you perceive with these expectations, the film delivers
nothing of value to the audience. Yes, DiCaprio is a competent, if not
a particularly great actor. Yes, Iñárritu is a talented director who
knows what he is doing, and yes, DiCaprio eats a real buffalo liver on
camera along with the promise of some beautiful natural scenery. And
that is precisely what the film delivers. However, what the film fails
to do that would ultimately capitalize upon these individual elements,
is create a cohesion that ties them and drives the movie forward as the
viewer is gripped in Hugh Glass' survival story. And what happens here,
when the vision is separated into these three distinct elements is a
really pretty, really boring movie.The plot is one of the film's more significant flaws. Iñárritu had
assembled all the resources to create a singular artistic vision that
would work the best outside a typical movie's generic plot conventions
(for an example of this, see "Valhalla Rising" which very effectively
combines its bleak and beautiful natural scenery with a rewarding and
engaging plot based in abstraction). "Generic", however is the word
that best describes "The Revenant"'s dragging plot. It's the most basic
revenge story there could possibly be, and this really dampens the
impact of Hugh Glass's real survival story. The sub-plot involving the
Natives searching for one of their own ends up being an utterly
pointless exercise that is totally isolated from the core of the movie
beyond a weak convention for the ending. Furthermore, the movie is
bogged down repeatedly with unnecessary flashbacks to Hugh Glass's
dying wife and the evil white colonizers burning down the village.
Towards the meat of the film, which is Hugh Glass's survival in the
harsh winter wilderness, all these elements bear close to zero
relevance.The written dialogue is fine for the most part, and provides ample
characterization to make the viewer care for some of the characters.
DiCaprio has little to work with, but what he has to deliver he
delivers decently. Domnhall Gleeson is very good and nuanced as the
Captain. Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) however, is one of the film's
highlights; although he does have some cheesy typical 'villain' lines,
his character is one the viewer could sympathize with. In the frontier
of "The Revenant", Fitzgerald is a man of realistic pragmatism and for
the most part his actions constitute a realistic sequence of decisions
that make his "villain" role a lot more compelling than some others
that flood the market. If it had been some other actor, it would have
been a very different performance and most likely, a less memorable
one. Tom Hardy continues to prove to be one of Hollywood's greatest
chameleons in recent times as he simply melts into the role.The special effects that were used were very well-made, and did not
distract; namely, the bear during one of the film's best and harrowing
scenes, was an example of masterful CGI and the entire bear attack
sequence was probably the best part of the movie, accentuated by
Iñárritu's extended shot. It's brutal and messy, and very convincing.
Beyond these instances of merit, the film is dragged down by an
abundance of excessive gimmicks and cliché. The meta aspect of the
filmmaking of the film supersedes the film itself a la "Boyhood" ("It
took 12 years to make!" repeats everyone associated with it). So what
if DiCaprio had to eat a real buffalo liver? He doesn't have to! He's
an actor! The movie defines itself with all these media
headline-grabbing gimmicks of how difficult it was to create and sure,
one can appreciate the effort that went in and how pretty it looks. But
beyond prettiness and Tom Hardy's performance, the movie is bogged down
with irrelevant subplots, a generic revenge story, and an
in-cohesiveness and lack of focus that makes the whole thing boring. If
you really love to observe great technical filmmaking and enjoy films
that take advantage of nature, then I would recommend "The Revenant".
If you're looking for one of the year's best films, or a compelling
story of survival, skip it.

Google defines revenant as: a person who has returned, especially
supposedly from the dead. It is safe then to say that I was a Revenant
after finishing Alejandro G. Iñárritu's big budget 2015 film. Strapping
in for a 2.5+ hour film, that I was ensured would be pure cinema
mastery, The Revenant proved to be a grave disappointment. All of the
buzz from critics and fans only assure me that herd mentality is alive
and well, and far more prevalent that even Friedrich Nietzsche could
have envisioned.The audience is introduced to explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio)
early on in the film. A legend in his own right, Glass is charged with
making sure his fellow fur trappers get home safely, as he is the one
who knows the open country best. Joined by his son, Hawk (Forrest
Goodluck) who is half Native American, Hugh is no stranger to tragedy.
His Native American wife was killed by white soldiers, devastating Hugh
and set him on a vagabond lifestyle afraid to call anywhere home too
long. Along the journey, a long (seemingly endless) winter ensues and
the group is forced to make difficult decisions to get home safely.
Glass is seen as the most knowledgeable in regards to traveling which
upsets another group member, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who almost
always disagrees with Glass's assessment of whatever situation is at
hand. After being viciously attacked by a bear, Glass is rendered
incapacitated, unable to speak, and reliant on the group to return him
to full health. The more brutal the winter becomes, the more Fitzgerald
wants to leave Glass for dead and make headway along with the men,
taking their firs to a big payday that awaits. Captain Andrew Henry
(Domhnall Gleeson), unable to pull the trigger and put Glass out of his
misery, splits the group up, leaving Glass, Hawk, and the young Bridger
(Will Poulter) to care for him and return home. Seeing an opportunity,
Fitzgerald volunteers to join the boys and Glass along the way. After a
scuffle with Hawk, then tricking Bridger, convincing him there are
Native Americans on their trail ready to kill them, they leave Glass
behind to fend for himself. In abandoning Glass, Fitzgerald goes
against Captain Henry's orders that if Glass should take a turn for the
worst, he is to have a proper burial. Believing he will die, Fitzgerald
goes about traversing the wilderness with the unwilling Bridger (who
sees what kind of man Fitzgerald really is). With nothing but anger and
will power assisting him, Glass vows recovery with the notion that he
will hunt Fitzgerald down over his betrayal. Forever dedicated to the
memory of his family, Glass fervently searches revenge as vengeance
overwhelms him.Sadly being overshadowed by DiCaprio, as the belief persists that he is
overdue for an Oscar, Tom Hardy performs exceptionally well in this
film. He plays a simple, yet greedy man capable of evil incredibly
convincingly. It is not easy to pull off such opposite personalities,
yet Hardy's brilliance as an actor makes it look easy. DiCaprio, on the
other hand, plays his part in a perfectly mediocre way. There wasn't a
lot to the part of Hugh Glass. Anyone can feign revenge and freezing.
Why this part was seen as such a difficulty escapes me, but "it's his
year" they say. The cinematography was a thing of beauty, but how could
it not be? When you have billions of billions of dollars and are using
the great outdoors, you better turn out a fantastic product. The
infamous bear scene was incredibly juvenile, as the CGI bear looked
ridiculous against the real life wilderness. I understand Iñárritu's
genius, as a I was a huge fan of Birdman, but he took everything that
was good about Birdman and overdid it to the point of making it look
ridiculous. What I do not understand is why Iñárritu chose to allow
condensation and blood to splatter the camera. This was an odd decision
as so much work was taken to establish realism; to then remind the
audience that "this is just a movie, see?' was a peculiar maneuver.
This film was also over the top in its use of gore. What is interesting
to me is that the same reviewers that criticized Quentin Tarantino's
Hateful Eight for over the top violence, have no problem for that same
imposing gore in The Revenant. Just goes to show, if you are viewed as
an artist, like Iñárritu, instead of a director like Tarantino, you can
get by with a lot more in Hollywood.What can be learned from The Revenant? Revenge should be left up to
God, or the world, or Native Americans-whichever you prefer. If you are
thinking, "ok, lots of movies share that message" so was I, but for
some reason, I thought this movie would tell it differentlyit does
not. I trusted that The Academy saw something in The Revenant that I
needed to see too; I remain unsure of what that "something" is. There
are more problems than positives in The Revenant, and I am only left
hoping for another Boyhood awards night; the movie everyone thought
would win every award it was nominated for, yet only took home a single
award. I am ever more convinced with each Best Picture nomination that
I watch that The Academy really missed the boat on giving a nod to
Carol.

First things first: The Revenant looks absolutely gorgeous, no doubt
about that! The fact that it is shot entirely on location with natural
lighting paid off in spades, as you'd be hard-pressed to find a film as
visually striking as this one, that also feels so gritty and brutal at
the same time. The action scenes are riveting and masterfully directed,
with the camera seamlessly flowing from one shot to the next, often
leaving you amazed and wondering how they pulled it off. That being
said, there are a few times where CGI had to be used and even though it
did not look in any way bad, the fact that the rest of the film looks
so incredibly real, made those moments stick out a little more than
they otherwise would.However, for all its amazing achievements in cinematography and
direction, it is far from perfect. I felt that it would have greatly
benefited from a shorter running time, as its excessive use of
landscape shots often brought an already slow paced film to a crawl.
The story isn't anything special; a pretty straightforward tale of
survival and revenge with some spiritual self-discovery thrown in for
good measure. Unfortunately, character development was minimal and I
wasn't as emotionally invested as I thought I should have been. DiCaprio's performance was compelling as usual even though some of the
more extreme situations his character manages to survive stretched my
suspension of disbelief a few times. Tom Hardy also gave a noteworthy
performance and the interactions between the two throughout the film
felt appropriately tense.Overall, while it falls short of greatness and requires some patience,
it's still worth seeing at least once for the cinematography alone.

The Revenant is in many ways absolutely masterful; to criticise such a
stunning piece of film-making almost feels inappropriate. But the film
highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of its talented director,
and lacks a few key ingredients which could have made this a
masterpiece in cinematic history.I doubt I need to comment on the fantastic visuals: the locations are
breath-taking, and the landscape shots repeatedly made me sit back and
marvel throughout the film. The actions scenes are some of the
best-directed I've ever seen - the Native American attack which opens
the film has the camera following events down low, on horseback,
underwater; it picks up a moment of action and moves onto the next. The
effect is to have the viewer feel involved in the scene, as if it were
unfolding right before your eyes, and it really drives home the sense
of chaos and confusion felt by the characters. The final fight of the
film (no spoilers) is one of the best of its kind ever recorded. I'm
tired of seeing perfectly choreographed, dirt-free finales. What you
get in The Revenant is so tense and visceral that everyone around me in
the cinema - many of whom were bored and restless with the film by this
point - were suddenly transfixed, gripping the arms of their chairs.
The scene combines the tension of the knife-fight towards the end of
Saving Private Ryan with uncompromising, unflinching brutality that
looks more like a bar fight than a movie duel.Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent; over the last few years he's grown from
one of my most disliked to one of my favourite actors. However, I
enjoyed Tom Hardy's performance even more. Partly this is because his
role in the film allows him to do much more than mostly express
physical pain; but what I love about Hardy is that he always makes his
characters believable as well as mesmerising to watch. Time and again
he steals the show and becomes the actor you can't wait for the camera
to pan back to in his recent films; another top-notch performance here.
Credit also to Domhnall Gleeson, who impressed me here as he did in Ex
Machina and The Force Awakens - a new star, for sure.For the points I've made so far, the film is worth seeing. It's an
astounding cinematic experience, especially in an age when over-use of
CGI predominates. Unfortunately, the film has its shortcomings too. To
say it felt 'bloated' would be unfair, considering the meticulous
attention to detail; but undeniably, this movie makes its length felt.
The key problem is the lack of an emotional core; the main character's
physical suffering and feats of endurance can only sustain our interest
for so long without any character development. An attempt to flesh out
the character is made with the clumsy inclusion of flashbacks and
hallucinations - these segments were tedious, though thankfully short.
Ultimately, we never really get to know our protagonist. Now, this need
not be too much of a problem - one of my favourite films, Apocalypto,
also indulges in minimal character development for its survival story.
Apocalypto did two things differently, however: firstly, the pace never
slackened; the main character is constantly chased and the action is
non-stop. The Revenant stops and starts and pans up to a tree canopy a
few too many times. Secondly, Apocalypto had a 'ticking clock' element,
lacking here. Apocalypto, then, was full of tension; The Revenant
really misses a narrative drive and ended up feeling too long. It's
similar to Werner Herzog's Aguirre: lots of stunning landscape shots,
lots of great cinematography, lots of admirable on-location work by the
actors and crew - but it's patience-testing. The ponderous nature of
The Revenant made it disappointing for me that Inarritu misses a couple
of great opportunities to ratchet up the tension: the opening attack
could have had a tense prelude before the action kicks off, and there's
a scene where the main character is discovered by Native Americans and
has to flee, which doesn't take its time and create some fear.It's difficult to create a strong narrative core to a film that's
essentially about the survival feats of one man, granted. But the
stop-start pace doesn't work well with the lack of character depth or
development, and leaves the audience questioning why they're watching
the gruesome spectacles on-screen; as we sit through another long scene
and reflect - there's certainly enough time to stop 'experiencing' the
film and start reflecting as a movie-goer - we wonder what all the
spectacle is in service of. And the answer is, well, a very shallow
story. Not that I think Inarritu aimed for a particularly deep story -
but his visual masterpiece struggles to fully hold the viewer's
attention. There is one opportunity for moral complication which is
declined (very non-specific to avoid spoilers): one of the men who
leaves the protagonist for dead doesn't simply leave him because thinks
he's going to die anyway and is worried about his own survival - he
also does *something else* which gives the main character reason to
hate him and want revenge. The *something else* is a non-historical
detail and could have been omitted - wouldn't it be more interesting
if, rather than a straightforward revenge plot, we have to question our
protagonist's right to seek revenge? If we the audience had to question
whether we would leave the man to die - if the protagonist himself had
to question this? If you're an impatient person, don't watch this film. To most people,
however, I'd recommend a watch. Go book yourself a good seat at a
cinema with a big screen and marvel at the visuals, the acting, and the
action.There's certainly enough that's great about this film to make me
excited to see what Inarritu does next.

The Revenant is based on true incidents. It is a rough hewn and
visceral film of survival and revenge.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass a member of a fur trapping
expedition escaping native Indians and who is viciously attacked by a
grizzly bear. Gravely injured, a small party is left behind to care for
him which includes his half Indian son and callous John Fitzgerald
played by Tom Hardy who dislikes Glass and especially his son.After some time Fitzgerald leaves Glass for dead and kills his son and
goes off to rejoin the main party. Glass does not die and wants
vengeance.The film was shot in natural light and has wonderful cinematography,
the CGI bear attack was very well done. Director Alejandro Iñárritu is
on a high after his best Director Oscar win for Birdman last year.However looking at this, I just felt it was a well made, sturdy but
overwrought and lengthy revenge flick. In fact with a heavily male cast
I regarded this film as a box office risk, one of the only major female
characters that it does have is seen to be getting raped.This is a gruelling picture of survival in harsh conditions but
strangely empty despite the pained performances from DiCaprio and
Hardy.I actually found when Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) set out
to apprehend Fitzgerald at the end rather laughable as it was so
incompetently done. Not only was Fitzgerald allowed to escape from the
fort as he was not guarded, nor was the money which was also stolen by
him but he does not take a garrison with him when searching for
Fitzgerald. It was a rather blunt attempt by the script to have a final
fact to face showdown by the two protagonists.

(As e-mailed to my few relatives, to impart the fair warning not to see
this silly and execrable film.)Just saw Revenant movie with open caption last night.I bought a ticket to Kung Fu Panda 3 that plays at the same time as the
movie. I may see it in hypocrisy to protest the idiot ["pendejo"]
director's soap box politics. But at least I refused to pay FOR the
movie directly, so they don't get my money, so there's that.As for my opinion:Terribly overrated. It's ridiculous, pretentious, inanely contrived
(esp. protagonist's dead Indian wife), frequently dull and thematically
& aesthetically anemic with one-dimensional characters especially the
villains who hammed it up.There is absolutely no point in this movie. It is offensively politically didactic to the audience on race
relations between Amerindians and whites, as if patronizing the
audience by the director's self- important mockery, which felt
overbearing with his overkill directorial style, like "Look at this,
look at me, isn't this pretty, great job (cinematographer buddy)
Chivo!"Some shots are irritating with "in your face" close-ups. There is
absolutely no tension throughout the movie because of over-directing
that is so palpably annoying it kills the enjoyment with occasional
dull pacing in paper-thin plot structure. There are unintentionally laughable scenes that require suspension of
disbelief like CGI animals (not just the mauling bear) and swimming in
the icy-cold river wearing bear fur coat with no adverse hypothermia
effect (frozen to popsicle afterwards in twenty degree temperature).
It's like a nature action movie with lack of logic as seen from
Hollywood perspective.As for Leonardo's acting, it's really nothing to write home about. It's
all method acting aided by the cold and chilly air that affect the
actor to nearly and almost overact. I really didn't think his acting
Oscar is due for this movie. It's a pity award. The movie drags way too long. An hour could be cut and nothing would be
lost. Pretentious filmmakers think length equals depth, but it's the
opposite. They are very shallow in preconception, heavy on
sensationalism (some scenes obviously pretentious as if the director is
a show-off) and light on logic and reasonable pacing.Inarritu is a total hack who pretends to be an intellectual when he is
not, instead he mugs as if he's on par with Kubrick. Cinematography is
the only thing that's good about the movie, but still an awfully
pretentious movie with no point to comprehend.I checked my watch more than a few times during the movie. It's how
restless I felt. Gore doesn't phase me, but Inarritu's directing is the
worst and most irritating factor about this movie. George Miller is very calm, controlled and serenely self-assured in
commanding direction in contrast to Inarritu's desperately provocative
and bore-you-to-death pretentious approach to filmmaking. That Miller lost best direction Oscar to this sentimental and lecturing
hack Inarritu says a lot about the idiocy of Hollywood.Don't bother because it's so long and indulgent with pretension that
Leo's subtly Oscar-bait overreaching method acting cannot compensate
for how lousy this movie is, in terms of demerits. What a piece of crap. * out of four

I walked in the theater to watch The Revenant with a lot of
anticipation, expecting a thrilling, hi octane show. I walked out
exhausted, utterly disappointed and a lot more cynical about the
Academy Awards. To begin with, the bear scene was probably one of the
most horrifying scenes I have watched on the big screen in a long time.
Yes, it does leave an impact and you are shaken. But probably, that was
the only thing worth watching in the film. Of course the landscapes
were breathtaking, the long shots awe- inspiring, the contradictory
depiction of nature at its most beautiful and yet harshest was
impeccable. But this was not a National Geographic documentary we had
gone to see. We went to see a great tale being told masterfully.
Unfortunately, there was no tale to be told. The linear, predictable,
revenge story was probably the lamest I have seen in movies in a long
time. The seventies' angry young man revenge stories in Bollywood had
more meat, metaphorically speaking. Of course, The Revenant had more
physical meat of all kinds on display. Horse meat, bison meat, pig
meat, fish meat, human meat  you name it, and it was there. And all
this graphic display of gore and flesh and violence, all seemed to be
just a big fat gimmick than anything else. When you do not have a story
to tell, you need to resort to gimmicks to keep the audience occupied.
The dialogues were unnecessary. If you watched this in mute, I do not
think it would have made much of a difference to your experience. This
film has a motley group of characters, all flat through and through.
There is no evolution of characters, there is not back stories for us
to relate to, there is no point of emotional connect where we start
empathizing with them. The apologetically shown snippets of Glass's
back story left us wanting more. We would have loved to feel a bit more
of his tragedy than just some floating (literally!) fragments of his
imagination and dreams. Fitzgerald had better range  when facing
imminent death, he tries to have a conversation on moralities with
Glass after all his immoral acts  but still not worthy of an Oscar
nomination. The rest were all perfunctory. This was technically a
period film, but being set in the wild, hardly had any scope of
interesting detailing as period films would usually have. The whole
premise also feels very fantastical. The catastrophes that befell Glass
every other scene seem too contrived. And that he actually survives all
that in such inhospitable conditions seems highly improbable. Yes, if
it was a movie about miracles, and not the sheer mental strength and
vengefulness of the principal protagonist, it would have made more
sense. I fail to see, besides a snapshot of a grand vision, what was so
great directorially, for Iñárritu to fetch an Oscar for direction.
Coming to Leonardo's much awaited acting Oscar, yes, I love him and
believe he deserved one for sure. But not for this movie. He has given
more nuanced performances earlier in movies such as The Aviator, The
Wolf of Wall Street, Shutter Island, The Departed, to name a few. In
The Revenant, he really did not have much scope to demonstrate his
superlative acting skills given the circumstances his Glass was in.
With a lot of well-crafted prosthetics, a face full of hair, a strange
language to speak in, all he had to do was crawl and grunt and whisper.
Where really did he get an opportunity to "act"? Go watch it, if you
really do not have anything better to do.

The Bear was just trying to protect her cubs, of course she attacked,
and then instead of playing dead after the first attack, the idiot
takes a shot at her, thus instigating the 2nd attack - now there are
two orphaned cubs wandering the woods, did they survive, did some
kindly person take them in like in Born Free, are they plotting their
revenge for the death of their Mother? - unanswered questions I'll
never know the answers to - and I won't even get into what happened to
the poor horse, except that I now wonder if the inside of a horse
smells as bad as the inside of a Tonton.Anyway, The Revenant is a beautifully shot movie and DiCaprio acts the
heck out of it, but at over 2 and a half hours, it is way to long for
such a simple story, most of the film consists of Hugh Glass crawling
through the snow in order to survive and to exact revenge on the man
who left him for dead - the survival story is good, but gets stretched
out beyond the point of reason - we get it, Glass is a survivor. I also
had a problem with the beginning of the film which just jumps right
into an Indian battle without establishing who the characters were or
why we should care about them, and the ending in which Glass decides at
the last moment to let the Indians do his killing for him because that
makes him a better person somehow. The Revenant from all
prognostications is the film that will finally get Leonardo DiCaprio
his Best Actor Oscar, with that I am more than OK with as he should
have gotten one a long time ago, however I think he has made better
movies than this one.

So I decided to finally watch it.I sat there for about 3 hrs while Leo
was crawling in the snow waiting for something to happen.The whole
super tense crawling led to the big end scene fight with the bad
guy.And believe it or not the last scene lasted 1 min.Overall great scenery and I guess OK acting.If it wasn't Leo crawling
there I would have probably not finished it.So bonus points to him he
crawls great.Dialogue was 10 lines and really there were more horses
bears and snow than humans but the animals also did a good job.It feels like movie was about willpower more than all but it could have
been way shorter and maybe deeper understanding of the bond between
father and son.Feels like it starts from nowhere and ends up right
there as well.A similar movie I can think of was "The Grey" and it was way better

I'm not really sure what to make of 'The Revenant'. It has been a week
since I saw the film but it sort of feels like a distant memory.I definitely have respect for the film. You've heard this before but I
have to say that the cinematography is pretty fantastic. I was never in
awe at its beauty but it pretty much captured the perfect look for the
film. I can't help but feel that it looks "correct". The long takes and
hand-held shots are also pretty impressive. The acting is great all
round. Pretty much every actor does an impressive job in the roles that
they are well suited for. However, I wasn't really that engaged. I wasn't bored out of my mind
either, but the great craftsmanship can only go so far. The characters
aren't very interesting or relatable. This is especially a problem for
Hugh Glass. He didn't feel like much of a person, which meant I
couldn't feel his desperation or the brutality of the more violent or
gory parts of the film. I will admit that there were a couple of
moments where I looked away from the screen to see who in the cinema
was talking. I'm pretty sure I missed one of the dream/flashback
montages earlier on in the film because of this, which could have
resulted in me not caring much about the character, but I still feel
that we didn't learn much about the character throughout the rest of
the film.Overall, 'The Revenant' is a bit of a disappointment. It is a technical
wonder but there was too much focus on making it look real and not
enough focus on laying down the foundations that would make it actually
feel real.(In case you're wondering what happened to the people in the cinema
talking, it got the point where I had to shush them. One of them
glanced over at me as if I was being rude and they left a few minutes
later.)

I found this film pretty average, this is just a personal opinion! I've
seen so many great reviews for this film, but i felt it was quite
boring, repetitive, and lacked something amazing! (Apart from the bear
attack- which was great)At the start of the film i was trying really hard to get into it, but
found it was difficult to because the story was so bleh. It really
didn't capture me, or my boyfriend when we went to see it at the
cinema. I also felt that the film was too long (2.5hrs)! Hence why i
say it was repetitive, i think that this film could have been
condensed, and over within 2 hours. I can honestly not give credit for much. I enjoyed the bear attack, and
the fights with the other camp, and that was about it. The make-up was
outstanding, especially for the said bear attack, along with the
animations. I would not watch this film again!

In Deliverance you have a buildup to a climax, suspense (what is in the
woods), and involvement with the characters; will they survive?
*SPOILERS* Here, the climax is at the beginning. The raid on the camp.
The survivors escape and drag themselves (and the movie) to infinity.
When Glass (LDC) survives the fight with the bear , you know he will
survive everything. When his son is killed (at 47minutes) you know
already that he will take revenge.The notable action: raid on the camp 6m30s fight with the bear 1m45s
son is killed 1m50 escape by the waterfall 3m30s meeting with Indian
4m15sThat is, in the first 90 minutes of the movie, 18 minutes of action and
72 minute boredom.Then the script:Glass has to bring the group to a safer place, but he leaves the group
without reason (to be attacked by the bear)The Indians attack with dozens of horses, but then they change the
skins with the French because they suddenly have no horses. And so
on....

"The Revenant" is a movie that did so much correctly. Thanks to the
superb work of director Alejandro Inarritu and the cast and crew, the
movie is full of flawless cinematography, sound editing, acting,
directing, and visuals. The characters are not interchangeable and all
of their motivations make sense. By all accounts, this should be a
great movie. There is, however, something weighing it down.After being mauled by a bear, frontier man Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is left under the care of three others while the rest of his
team makes it back to their fort. One member of the team, Fitzgerald
(Tom Hardy) kills Glass' son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), and leaves Glass
for dead, fleeing back to the fort. Hellbent on revenge, Glass travels
across the dangerous wilderness back towards the fort to find
Fitzgerald.Glass' motivation for wanting revenge makes sense: Fitzgerald killed
his son and left him for dead, though Glass seems to not care as much
about the being left for dead part. The problem is that the entire
situation just makes you ambivalent to Glass' struggle. Fitzgerald only
killed Hawk after he was making noise and Fitzgerald couldn't get him
to quiet down. He was also in the middle of dangerous territory and
bringing the wounded Glass along was most likely suicide. He is clearly
a bad person, but based on the circumstances, his clear life picture,
and the time period that the movie takes place in, it can be viewed as
less evil and more of survival instinct. As you can make these defenses to Fitzgerald, when Glass goes after
him, your only reason to actually care is because Glass is the
protagonist. I personally found myself not caring if Glass got his
revenge or not. Since the lust for revenge is what pilots the movie, it
ends up feeling long and boring because you can't connect with any of
the characters."The Revenant" has a lot of flawless qualities to it. Getting you to
care about the story is not one of them.

"The Revenant" is an adventure for revenge that is violent and crude
but also so beautiful. Iñarritu invites the audience to let themselves
be shaken and taken on a journey for survival, in one of the most
spectacularly and beautifully filmed movies of recent years, with a
breathtaking cinematography and scenery. Leonardo DiCaprio giving us,
once again, a great performance and every time I watch his movies, I
understand why I am one of his fans since way before "Titanic". The
jokes about him never getting an Oscar, I think will stop this
February. This movie has a really powerful story and although a bit
overlong, is nonetheless a stunning achievement, and one of 2015's best
movies.

If I rated the quality of this movie, it'd be a straight 10.
Beautifully shot, breathtaking CGI and very realistic. During the last
fight I got this weird sensation inside me, like i was being murdered
but in a good way. I don't think that the animal cruelty, which bothers
a lot of people, was overdone. It was a bit shocking which just further
contributes to the realism. Every new shot was even better than the
previous and those long ones were utter masterpiece. Nothing I'd
change. Acting was very good, DiCaprio and Hardy just keep proving
their class. On the other hand, plot was one of the biggest disappointments I have
ever witnessed. I begged my father, who watched the movie in a showing
5 hours before mine not to spoil it for me. But at the end, I don't
think he could even if he wanted to, We all knew movie would end up
like that. There was almost no suspense, no cliff-hangers, no twist and
no satisfying moments at all. It's simply one very long, dull and empty
revenge-seeking journey. I was secretly hoping that Glass would die at
the end just so I can feel even a bit surprised but, of course, it
didn't happen. The only surprise I had was Hawk's death since in teaser
trailer Glass said "...to find my son" so I assumed it'd be a
revengeful search mission, which I honestly think would suit this movie
better. To sum it up, 10 for quality and 0 for plot resulted in a 5/10.
Stunning and gorgeous but I'd rather fight that bear than re-watch
this. I respect it very much but wish that it struck out by something
more than just a pretty face.

A slow, struggling movie with a purifying taste. The sun comes in to
the picture, rising when the killing starts. It was very deep but slow.
The chilly atmosphere fits perfect for the screen, the harsh storms,
the never ending snowfall, the dreams of the dead loved ones form part
of the weight which the protagonist carries all the journey and after a
while we also start feeling this burden and carry on with him. But in
my opinion the film is too long and slow. By the end of the movie I
have noticed that I merely forgot the scars the grizzly bear left on
Glass and that bear attack was a crucial point in the picture because
lead to the main injury, the issue why Glass could not protect his son,
Hawk from Fitzgerald. If you love Leo D you must not miss this movie.
Thank you for reading.

I'm not really sure why I went and saw this film, or what to even
expect. I guess the title attracted me a little, namely because it
refers to a mythological undead creature who returns to enact revenge
upon somebody. The idea is that the revenant has had such an injustice
committed against it that it cannot rest in peace until that injustice
has been rightened, and the injustice usually involves some sort of
murder (either against the revenant or somebody close to it), and the
vengeance usually involves the murder of the perpetrators of that
injustice.Basically that is what this movie is about, though the main character,
Hugh Glass, isn't actually killed (but he comes pretty close to being
in such a state). Basically he is a member of a fur trapping party that
is attacked by native Americans (who are hunting the kidnappers of one
of their daughters) and are forced to flee across the wilderness back
to their home base. On the way Glass is attacked and mauled by a bear,
but manages to survive  barely (and I must admit that the scene where
we was being mauled by the bear was brilliant). However it becomes
increasingly clear that it is going to be difficult, if not impossible,
to get him back home, so they leave him with a couple of others until
help arrives (or until he dies, whichever comes first). Mind you, one
of the guys, Fitzgerald, isn't a big fan of Glass, so when the others
have left, he kills Glass's son, and then buries Glass alive.The rest of the movie is basically Glass crawling his way across the
frozen wilderness seeking to avenge the murder of his son. In fact the
first half of the movie is the lead up to him being left for dead, and
the rest of the movie is him (and the others) making their way back to
the fort. To say that it does drag on a bit is an understatement. Okay,
it doesn't drag on in the sense that it is boring, but it does feel
that it probably could have been a lot shorter. Mind you, we are
talking about a movie that goes on for about two hours, and I'm not
sure how much of the movie was needed (though I suspect that the
original idea could have been a lot longer). Still, I guess the length
of the movie is supposed to give us the impression of how sparse and
empty this wilderness is, and the amount of time that it actually takes
to return to civilisation.A part of me also felt that there may have been a couple of
anachronisms. In fact for much of the movie I was trying to work out in
which year it was set, and the reason that I was a little confused was
because the Indians were seeking out some French fur traders (and these
fur traders appear every so often). The odd thing I found is that the
French had sold the Louisiana Territories to the United States in the
early 19th Century, though I suspect that there were probably still a
number of French fur trappers lurking around their afterwards (it is
unlikely that all of the French living there packed up and went home as
soon as Napoleon sold the territories to the United States).In the end it was an okay movie. At times it felt like a western,
though with most westerns the underlying theme is the idea of taming
the west and bringing civilisation to the wilderness. In this film it
is a battle against the wilderness and the wilds, but also the desire
of one man to seek vengeance against the murder of his son. In a way he
is over coming the harsh reality of the empty (and cold) wilderness to
see vengeance done, to overcome the human limitations (we are always
confronted with the reality that this is a cold and desolate place).
The fact that he manages to survive the freezing climate to finally
confront his enemy goes to show the length that some people will go to
to seek vengeance.

Very long movie for a thin story! A lot of closeup violence without
moving the story forward. Father motivated by revenge but why is the
commander of the base so eager to put his life in danger for a "scouts"
loss.Closeup filming with wide angle lens to the point where it just becomes
tiresome. I wonder how many times the actors bumped their heads into
the camera lens.High point of movie is Bear-Mauling Scene after this fast forward
button is your friend! No loss if you don't watch this movie.Similar to The Soldier, Leo and Kurt Russel hardly speaks in the movie.

"The Revenant" is the Angry Super Model of the Oscar SeasonThe Oscar for best cinematography goes to Emmanuel Lubezki for "The
Revenant." "The Revenant" is the best looking film I have seen in many years. The
depth of the shots is overwhelming; the mountains and the snow in the
film are amazing to look at. Unfortunately, the plot and characters
don't live up to the look of "The Revenant." The film is vacuous and
lacks substance, much like a china doll. DiCaprio is good as Hugh Glass, but like the best player on a team that
doesn't win a championship doesn't deserve an MVP award, DiCaprio
doesn't deserve a best Oscar nod for his performance in "The Revenant."
The other characters are flat and underdeveloped, and the acting is
crushed under the beauty of the photography. Certainly, John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy has his moments, but he
doesn't bring the character up to the level of pure hatred. For a
revenge film, you need someone like Bill McKinney who played Captain
Terrell in "The Outlaw Josey Wales." Now that was a character you love
to hate. Fitzgerald didn't have enough of a past for us to fully
appreciate how despicable he is. Thus, the revenge tale is not charged
enough. Besides, Fitzgerald had a point when he told the Captain that
he didn't trust Glass as a guide since Glass had failed to detect the
Ree surround the trappers early in the film. While Hugh Glass is a man of few words; his son Hawk is practically
mute. There are decent flashbacks that demonstrate their relationship,
but what of the son in the present? There is little to go on. And the
role of the Captain might as well have been left out of the film. The
actions the Captain takes are heroic, and at the same time, incredibly
stupid.There is little tension in the film other than the violence of some of
the moments. There are no revelations of Glass's tracking acumen, no
feeling of impeding doom felt by the evil Fitzgerald who thinks Glass
is dead, no surprises in the chase and nothing revealed that is a
surprise at all. All that is left is the beauty of nature and the
inevitable cruelty of humanity. None of that is surprising. Rating: MatinéeSee it for the scenery, but don't expect to be surprised by the action
or enthralled with the characters. Peace, Tex Shelters

I am very surprised this is being considered for awards. This will
probably be my shortest review to date.I do love period movies. I also really like Leo DiCaprio. But, not this
one. The most unlikely thing I noticed was the good performance of Will
Poulter, who was Gally in "The Maze Runner".Mainly, there were two parts to this movie. "Wake me when Glass gets to
the Outpost" and "Wake me when he gets the bad guy". The bear attack scene was good. The relationship he had with his son
seemed genuine. Flashbacks to Glass and his wife did not seem genuine. Kudos for the acting when not able to speak, but it still didn't
connect emotionally. Many parts really dragged on and on. The movie was quite a let down after all the hype. 6/10

Given that virtually all the pre-awards hype since September has been
about DiCaprio's performance and potential first Oscar, I'm going to
split this review into two parts: DiCaprio & the film.The film: A beautiful film with insanely good cinematography and
camera-work, an excellent score and superb acting all round. From the
films I've seen so far it should definitely win Best Cinematography.
The scenery and backdrops are epic in scale and totally immersive. The
camera-work also helps really place the viewer in the film and has some
different and quirky ways of shooting which I definitely respected. The
score (as with Bridge of Spies) is also excellent and matches the film
perfectly. I'm very surprised it didn't get a nod for Best Score.
Finally as mentioned, the acting across the board. Tom Hardy in
particular is fantastic and absolutely nails his character. In fact I'd
argue his is the most memorable character and best performance in the
film. Whatever the case I'd certainly place him above Bale (The Big
Short) and probably Rylance (Bridge of Spies) too, in terms of the
films I've seen so far, and would love to see him win the Oscar for
Best Supporting Actor.However... a film can't stand up on its sound, acting and
cinematography alone. The story needs to be of a top calibre as well if
you are to be considered for Best Picture. And it is here where I feel
the film falls down a little bit. Don't get me wrong, I've given it a 7
and thought it was good. I certainly respect Iñárritu for what he's
achieved. But did it blow me away? Was I wholly immersed and engaged in
the story? Did I find myself empathising with the characters?
Unfortunately the answer to all these questions is no. I can't really
say I was gripped by the film, I thought it started well but actually
got worse as it went on and by the end I find myself looking at my
watch as it began to drag. Additionally there were a few scenes which
got my back up... firstly on two occasions Iñárritu filmed scenes which
I found myself thinking were totally unrealistic, which was odd given
how expertly most of the scenes were shot and set out. one where French
soldiers don't see what's happening to one of their men 20 feet away
and in plain view... and the other where horseback native-Americans
fail to shoot him from mere metres away. Additionally I thought the
final scene felt a bit cliché and was far too 'James Bond' style for a
film like this. It felt a bit obvious and a somewhat of a cop out.So in summary, technically it's great but as a story, there's better.
Iñárritu should certainly be considered for Best Director given what
he's managed to achieve here but the film in my opinion should not win
Best Picture.DiCaprio: First off let me say that yes Leonardo Dicaprio should win an
Oscar. Should he win one this year, for this performance however? I'm
not so sure. Let's analyse what a performance worthy of Best Actor
should be... The actor should create a memorable character, a character
that stands out as the best thing in the film, they should put in a
performance that has you mesmerised from start to finish. Take Eddie
Redmayne last year... What he pulled off was nothing short of
spectacular. He became Stephen Hawking... by the end of the film you
forgot you were watching Eddie Redmayne as he had totally transformed
himself, not only physically but mentally, verbally, in fact in
everything he did in that performance. It was well and truly worthy of
a Best Actor win. I wasn't too fussed about There Will be Blood as a
film but Daniel Day-Lewis' performance and the character he created
still lives in my memory even though the film itself has been long
forgotten. Ask yourself, what's the first thing you think of when you
think about The Dark Knight? It's Heath Ledger... that's how good his
performance was!Now going back to DiCaprio. Can those of you who've seen it really say
he's the thing you will remember about the film in years to come? As I
stated earlier, in my opinion it was Tom Hardy's character and
portrayal that is the one which sticks out for me, not DiCaprio's.
Don't get me wrong, he is excellent and doesn't put a foot wrong. But
did it excel? Did it do what other actors haven't done this year? No.
The film studio has spent lots of time and money hyping up his
performance this year, long before the film had been seen. We were told
how he'd slept in carcasses, been subject to extreme conditions and
generally put through his paces. DiCaprio himself has told us that it's
the hardest film he's ever had to make. But do these things mean he
should win Best Actor? Just because your director makes you sleep in an
animal carcass or subjects you to horrible conditions and filming
hours, does not mean you yourself have done an incredible job with your
character. It simply means your committed to your job and the role. I'm
not saying I'd fancy it, I totally respect him for what he's done and
he did an excellent job with the character, but realistically he spent
a good 3/4 of the film crawling/walking and breathing heavily. I'm not
convinced another actor wouldn't have played the character just as
well. And for that reason I question whether he deserves an Oscar
specifically for this role, despite how difficult it may have been to
do. I honestly went into this, wanting it to be one of the best
performances I've ever seen. But when you strip back all the hype and
all the pre-awards material that's been pressed upon us and just judge
the performance itself, I don't think it's a stand-out.

Yes, this is a visually beautiful movie. The cinematography is
stunning. BUT, I just couldn't get past the unbelievability of this
movie. There is no way that any human being could have survived what
Leo did in this movie. First of all, it takes place in the high
mountains in the dead of a cold, snowy winter. He does not wear gloves
and his fingers don't get frost bite; he falls into a frigid grand
rapid river, down multiple waterfalls and doesn't instantly freeze to
death; he continues crawling around in those wet clothes in the snow
and still doesn't freeze to death; he's mauled by a bear, including the
bear ripping a giant hole in his throat that the water he drinks pours
out of and said bear dying on top of him, and he doesn't bleed to death
or get crushed to death; he and his horse take a leap off a 150' cliff,
the horse is splattered on the ground but Leo miraculously lands in the
top of a tree and somehow survives; need I go on?The movie is excruciatingly long at 2 1/2 hours. It was torture. I
actually tried to kill time in the bathroom. Go see Spotlight instead.
That's the Academy Award worthy picture.

Imagine a cross between Jeremiah Johnson, Get Carter and Superman and
you have The Revenant (sounds pretty good). This is basically an old
fashioned revenge saga. Now I know it's a remake of the superior Man In
The Wilderness starring the late great Richard Harris but it really did
get a bit carried away with itself.The filming is great and the huge landscapes are the real stars of the
show. The problem, as in so many movies these days, is one of
plausibility. Without giving too much away our hero (DiCaprio) survives
not one, not two, not three but about 7 brushes with CERTAIN death. Colossal loss of blood, wet clothes in a sub zero environment,
strangling, smothering, , falling off a cliff, drowning, knives, guns,
Indians, baddies, gangrene..................the list goes on and on and
all that was really missing was a red cape, a kiss curl and a cameo
performance from Stan Lee.Awards should go to the technical folk and it must've been a tough
shoot for the cast but when you boil it all down there's a lot more
gravy than meat and potatoes.

"The Revenant" is the modern man's flagellation. We feel guilty of our
sheltered and consumerist lifestyles, and, seeking absolution, enjoy
this high-profile torture porn and its complacent "Back to the Roots"
ideology.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a trapper of the Wild West who is
severely wounded after a Grizzly attack and sees his half-Native son
being murdered by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), one of the fellow men
assigned to wait for his likely death and bury him. Glass survives and
sets out on a vengeful hunt. DiCaprio's performance is supposed to be
authentic, but it is the pinnacle of artificiality and vanity to jet
off from Beverly Hills to the wilderness, eat raw liver being a
vegetarian and then return to be decorated with Oscar glitz. When
compared to characters like Howard Hughes and Jordan Belfort, which
allowed the world's top movie star to bring into effect his public and
screen persona and which provided Oscar-worthy performances, Hugh Glass
is merely a groaning body mass. Going to physical extremes is
commendable in the context of making a film but it does not equal great
acting; otherwise, "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!" or the shows
of Bear Grylls would offer some high art.The clash of harsh realism and Hollywood bravado is most obvious in the
Grizzly scene. Director Alejandro G. Iñarritu is not content to show a
real bear and indicate the fight. The bear must maul Leo horribly for
several minutes to prove that this movie is really grim and dead
serious, but in order to achieve that you have to put up with a CGI
beast. Likewise, Emmanuel Lubezki's camera whirls around, showing us
untamed nature, scars and wounds via elaborate choreographies, of which
the first one admittedly results in a very well-made action sequence.Iñarritu suggests that there must be some profound truth in Nature.
Suffering is real. Animals are authentic. Indigenous people, who play a
part in an unnecessary side plot involving the kidnapping of a chief's
daughter, are presented as spiritual, even transcendental creatures.
Noble savages, one might say. One of them wisely notes, "Revenge is in
the hands of God, not men", to great effect on Hugh Glass. His last
acts are interwoven with and, as it were, directed by visions of his
dead Native American wife, a Mother Earth figure. Charles Bronson, if
you recall, needed no esoteric hokum to elevate his thirst for blood.

The Revenant is just a remake of the 1972 movie Jeremiah Johnson
starring Robert Redford??? Hollywood can't seem to come up with any new
ideas. Now just making remakes under a different title... or am I
missing something? Sure in the 2015 version the cinematography is
better and the fight scenes more gruesome but the story line is still
the same.And for not doing any of his stunts DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar
for looking wild thanks for the great makeup artists. Now that's
Hollywood today. My oh my how things have changed. Yesteryear, the
Oscars celebrated talent now it is just political

Some awesome scenery, and an attempt at a feel good story gone horribly
wrong! I realize that most people don't have any survival training but
I would guess that more than a few have common sense; and if you have
any common sense, this movie is insulting! 1. When you are struggling to stay alive in sub zero weather, certain
death will come if you get your clothes wet.......he does it
repeatedly.2. When you are trying to survive among hostile Indians, you only build
a fire to save your life and then you build a well hidden fire the size
of your hat because Indians will see/smell your fire.......he builds
bon-fires out in the open.3. A muzzle-loading weapon can only be fired once, you must then reload
it which takes roughly 30 seconds for the most accomplished
user......he shoots multiple times, rapid fire, with a muzzle loading
pistol.4. While it's true that you can survive in the cold by gutting your
horse and using it's internal warmth to save your life, a full grown
man cannot climb inside the chest cavity of a gutted horse.......the
horse would have to be 20 feet long.I understand creative license for directors but this was just awful!

visual effects were stunning, but the movie was flat out boring. The
story is old and over played and the entire movie seemed like a cross
between Castaway and Payback. DiCaprio's character gets attacked by a bear, buried alive, rides a
horse off of a cliff, careens down a freezing river and gets stabbed,
but still survives. Wow, how exciting.And to think that he can even be nominated by an academy award is
amazing. He grunted through the entire film and when he finally could
speak, he did a bad impression of Marlin Brando in the Godfather.Don't waste your money or time (lots of time) on this movie.

Leonardo DiCaprio won a Golden Globe for his performance as Hugh Glass
in The Revenant, and the movie is nominated for a dozen Oscars. If
these awards were for fortitude alone, the accolades would be
well-deserved, as cast and crew have spoken at length about the
physical hardships they faced in filming this movie. "The elements sort
of took over," DiCaprio told Wired interviewer Robert Capps. One must
wonder, why did they undertake such a difficult and potentially
perilous project? Perhaps they did it because younger audiences today
haven't grown up knowing about the privations and violence inherent in
the settlement of the Westthere was life before Disneylandand need to
have the blood and guts smacked in their face. In which case, the movie
is a success. It's based in part on Michael Punke's novel The Revenant:
A Novel of Revenge, set in 1820s Montana and South Dakota along the
Upper Missouri River. If they want to give cinematography awards to
Emmanuel Lubezki for this film, I will be standing in the front row
cheering. It is a beautiful filmwith breathtaking views of the western
United States (and Canada, Mexico, and Argentina)shot with a deep
depth of field worthy of a Sierra Club coffee table book. Snow-melt
rivers, star-spangled nights, forests that pull you into the sky. It's
just that we're shown unspeakable violence, then astounding beauty,
then unspeakable violence, then astounding beauty, then unsp. . . .you
get the rhythm. In fact the violence was always so gruesome that it
became (I hate to say this, since human and animal lives were
purportedly involved) borrring. The beauty that followed it began to
feel like heavy-handed ironic commentary, losing any capacity to
soothe. The sound design and music are emotionally apt and compelling,
I thought (score by Carsten Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto. Director
Alejandro González Iñárritu, who wrote the script with Mark L. Smith,
did not conceive of Hugh Glass as anything more than a character bent
on revenge. Glass pursues this hollow quest for pretty much two hours
and thirty-six minutes. What I like to see in a character is some
growth, some change, some "ok, this is awful, but I can rise above it"
(or not). But while DiCaprio may well be capable of a meatier
performance, the film doesn't ask it of him. We learn nothing by
watching it except that having an angry mama-bear drooling over you is
really disgusting, but wait a sec, now she's going to fling you around
like a rag doll again. And drool some more. For good reason, we don't
like the Frenchies, or the single-minded Indians, or the dim Americans.
Everywhere they appear, Lubezki's beautiful landscape is soon tainted
by blood, usually human. Please. A little nuance. But, as Manohla
Dargis says in a New York Times review, Iñárritu "isn't given to
subtlety." The word revenant means "ghost," and it was clear why the
ghosts of Glass's murdered wife and son keep reappearing and where they
will lead him. And I won't even mention the many, many instances in
which the viewer Sees What's Coming a Mile Away.

I guess society has reached the point where everyone is living in a
virtual fantasy world. There is little grasp on reality anymore,
especially in film - when a truly good story is represented in this
completely fantasized and revolting manner. The only likely reality in
this film is that he was mauled by a bear. That's where reality and
fantasy end! We stayed until the last 10 minutes before we could not
take another second of this sickening stench of a film. Be warned, if
you have a healthy dose of common sense, you'll hate this film - and
yourself for paying to see it. Now I see that I have to write 10 lines about this wretched film in
order for them to publish it. Great! Unfortunately I do not have
anymore to say...

There is almost nothing good to say about this film. It was painful to
watch, slow, no joy or any good feelings, and just plain boring after a
while. I cannot understand why it got so many awards. Even the nature
scenes which were beautiful were impossible to enjoy because of the
feeling of dread hanging over every scene.The last hour was predictable. I dreaded what was to come, holding out
hope that it would not be a long drawn out ending to an exhausting
film. Unfortunately, the pain was drawn out. Like a bad dream that
would not end.It is worse than a waste of my money, it ruined my evening and will
make me feel awful for days. Avoid this film.

Sorry but this movie is terrible. You get thrown in the movie without
any explanation of the story and the characters and during the movie
this doesn't improve. What really annoyed me is the fact that the movie
was very unrealistic, like a lot of others users write in their reviews
on IMDb. Leonardo gets attacked by a bear but survives. Fine, but after
this it gets ridiculous. His body is mauled and after his friends carry
him for about 2 days, Leo gets buried alive but decides to resurrect
and find tom hardy, who killed his son. THe rest of the movie is
unrealistic bull crap for a gullible audience. Apart from the fact that
Leo almost eats nothing but is able to move his extremely wounded body
around amazed me, since i have been in a live threatening situation
myself and there is no way that you recover from such injuries so fast
in the extreme cold and without any food. Leo also seems untouched by
the cold weather and the water because he throws himself in an icy
river and when he gets out he doesn't even shiver. A normal person
would have hypothermia. He falls with his horse down a huge cliff and
survives and when Leo gets chased by 10-20 Indians they all shoot at
him but keep missing from close range and Leo EVEN FIRES HIS FLINT LOCK
PISTOL TWICE WITHOUT RELOADING!! Come on, did nobody notice this? I cant believe people give this movie such a high rating but they must
be the people who also think a series like the Walking Dead is worth
10/10.

Revenge should be deliberate and sweet. This was bitter and unrealized.Way over-the-top political correctness. Too many scenes where
protagonist has visions of broken churches/crucifixes. Yet glorious
visions of trees and nature. The mystic visions of the native in his
dreams are portrayed as angelic and wholesome. Whereas any reference to
the male and god-forbid white male is depicted in demeaning ways.The movie uses too much Christian stereotypes to portray the evil
character as more evil. Glorify the poor natives, degrade/insult the
white male at every possible opportunity.Hollywood has become a political wing of the hate-the-white-male
democratic party.

Just watched the Revenant with Leo Dicraprio. Leo gets killed amillion times. -He is attacked by hostile natives ( he lives) -Attacked
by female grizzly bear ( huge).. Kills it with a tiny knife. (must have
been well trained) -Falls down a ravine ( he still lives) - Big huge
bear fall on top of him (he is still around) but he is wounded - Gets
buried alive (crawls out) - almost starves to death but finds a
McDonalds - Eats raw fish and is hunted by the same hostile natives.
they must have been film critics. Escapes -Falls down huge rapids and
waterfalls (just gets wet) -Steals a horse is hunted again by the same
film critics and rides the horse over a 30m cliff through a pine tree,
lands face down and is OK. Poor horse -Staggers around starving down to
his last BigMAc an is rescued.- Is OK the next morning and goes to look for his son's killer and gets
into a gunfight.Guess what happens next.On the positive side this movie was filmed around Bragg Creek and
Kananaskis Park. they were careful not to include the gold course in
the movie. The positive side is the cinematography is really great.Hate to be a spoiler but watch this this is about it. If u have spent
time in the winter about here and encountered a bear like that I don't
think u would live.Watch this on the net but it is 157 minutes long. Don't spend any money
on it like Star Wars XXIII.

"The Reventant" offers mediocre, straightforward and predictable plot.
The good guy, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), is a 19th century
superhero who survives grizzly bear attack and revenges for the death
of his son by punishing Fitzgerald, the greedy bad guy, played by Tom
Hardy. As expected, there is a fierce struggle between the good and the
bad guy at the end of the movie. "The Reventant" is not for everyone. There are a lot of brutal scenes
with violence and blood. It is a strange mix between the blood, the
camera shots and angles from Tarantino's movies such as "Kill Bill"
with the classical action movies about revenge, like the popular old
title with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, or Liam Neeson.The actors do a fine job in obviously difficult conditions.
Unfortunately, the characters are not unique and the dialogs are not
memorable at all. I do not remember even a single quote from "The
Reventant" that stands out. There is no doubt that Leonardo DiCaprio
and Tom Hardy are brilliant and deserve praises despite the poor
scenario. In my opinion Will Poulter was fortunate to play the most
interesting character in the whole movie and he also did a good job.

The first bit of this review is spoiler-free. I'll let you know when
the spoilers start, so for all you die-hard cinephiles who have managed
to stay off Wikipedia for as long as you have, don't worry -- I have
your interests at heart.The Revenant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki opted to film only in
natural light, often leaving the crew with only 90 minutes of specific
light to shoot long, arduous scenes. While this proved to be a
difficult policy to maintain, it really shows on the big-screen, the
natural light complementing the intricate juxtaposition between beauty
and brutality that Lubezki and Iñárritu so meticulously maintain
throughout the film. As a Canadian, and one blessed to live so near to
the Rocky Mountains, I see many a shot that is vaguely recognizable,
from the frozen lake with snow-capped peaks in the distance to the
mountains silhouetted against the Northern Lights. Lubezki revels in
the natural beauty of unspoiled wilderness -- as he should.But what The Revenant taught me is that beauty is desensitizing,
especially if one is inundated with it in a repetitive and unrelenting
manner, eventually taking on a (beautiful) monotony. Each scene is done
in exactly the same manner: 1. Beautiful nature shot for approximately ten seconds 2. Setting shot
3.Tracking shotsWhile this strategy is at first riveting, its repetition becomes all
too clear after about the first hour or so. I was left in a dull state
of certainty as to what was to happen next, amplified by the film's
predictable narrative and false profundity.Now, that isn't to say that the Revenant doesn't initially succeed. The
first hour or so of the film is more transporting and disturbing than
any CGI-infused blockbuster. Up to the midway point of the film, I was
ready to proclaim it the best film of the year. Despite Dicaprio's lack
of a need to act (he mostly just crawls around and screams), he crawls
and screams quite well. If that's what the Academy is looking for, I'd
say for sure, give him the Oscar that he's supposedly been deserving of
for so many years. But acting in general is not something I am prone to
appreciate, as I find that the best actors/actresses only succeed when
the audience doesn't see them as an actor/actress.I LOVE gritty filmmaking, and The Revenant is as gritty as it gets. We
see Dicaprio getting rained on, beaten to a pulp, soaking wet, falling
off cliffs, crawling around with a broken leg, dirty, ragged, you name
it. The environment that the film depicts is harsh, Iñárritu refusing
to compromise his wonderfully maintained atmosphere of mud, blood, and
water for the sake of the audience, and we are so much the better for
it. Sure, it's tough to watch, but it's not so much imposing as
demanding. [*SPOILERS FROM HERE*] The Revenant becomes extremely predictable after the first hour.
Dicaprio gets mauled by a bear (the scene is brutal), and left for dead
by John Fitzgerald (Hardy), who kills his son right in front of him.
It's undeniably disturbing stuff, especially when Iñárritu decides to
throw in some gore to spice things up. Dicaprio then finds his dead
son, and then the film segues into a tiresome, revenge flick that
echoes man's immaturity while attempting to demonstrate some sort of
profound knowledge of the human condition. In truth, The Revenant is as
emotionally corrupt as its characters. By the end of the film, Dicaprio
has come such a long way, seen so much, and yet, he is the exact same
man that he is before.I hate to quote Shakespeare, but "the rarer action is in virtue than in
vengeance", and this film fails to realize that. And yet, it sees fit
to assume a certain undeserved intelligence (through the use of symbols
and flashbacks).Technically, the film is a masterpiece despite its repetition.
Narratively, the film has a flawless beginning and a solid ending.
Thematically and intellectually, the film is a mess.

Revenge may be a primal human drive, especially in the setting and time
period in which "The Revenant" is set, but it makes for a very boring
narrative hook if you don't give a hoot about the person seeking
revenge or the person that person is seeking revenge against.Alejandro G. Innarritu's latest exercise in human misery is two and a
half hours of Leonardo DiCaprio suffering capped off by a showdown that
finds him getting what he wants -- the death of the man who left him
for dead after being mauled by a bear and then killed his son. Does
Innarritu use this story to bring any insight into the human condition?
Are we given any reason to care about DiCaprio's character other than a
couple of obligatory flashbacks that use narrative shortcuts to tell us
that he had a wife who was killed? Could the villain, played by Tom
Hardy without a hint of nuance or subtlety, be any more of a
caricature? Innaritu directs every single shot with a self-conscious
sense of self- importance, as if he's pausing to say to the audience,
"Just wait and see how impressed you are going to be with my
directorial skill." Too bad it all adds up to such a boring, one-note
slog.DiCaprio will win what everyone seems to think is a long overdue Oscar
for this performance, despite the fact that he's given the same
performance in his last ten movies and he's asked to do no more in this
one than grunt, moan, and grimace his way through it. Every time I hear
anyone talk about how brilliant he is in "The Revenant," the focus is
on how difficult the shoot was, not how well he acted the part.
Honestly, the brilliant makeup work is 95% of his performance."Birdman" was the first Innarritu movie I've really liked, and it looks
like that was an anomaly. His philosophy seems to be predicated on the
belief that human existence is something to suffer through until one
finds a reward in the afterlife. Since I don't believe that at all, his
movies have nothing to say to me. Grade: C

From the opening moments of The Revenant, I knew this film was going to
be special. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film opens with a mesmerising
battle sequence, both brutal and beautiful in its execution, and goes
on to tell a captivating story of survival and revenge that will remain
as one of the more memorable cinematic experiences I will ever have.When a party of fur trappers are driven off course by an attack from a
Native American tribe, they look to Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), a
frontiersman who knows the territory well, to set them on a new one.After being mauled by a grizzly bear and with his life hanging in the
balance, Glass is eventually left for dead by members of his own
hunting party, leaving him facing a fight for survival and a chance of
revenge, if he can survive the harsh conditions.The troubles that the film faced during filming have been
well-documented, with crew members quitting due to the harsh conditions
and locations however, the finished product would suggest to me that it
was all worth it because The Revenant really is an amazing piece of
filmmaking.I left the cinema absolutely breathless, mainly just because of how
visually stunning the film is. There are shots that will leave you
opened-mouthed and shots that will simply leave you questioning,
"How?!". The decision to shoot the film in natural lighting is a brave
one and it really adds such an authenticity to proceedings. There's a
moment late on in a forest where the only light given off is from
torches and it's just glorious.Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, really is in a rich vein of form in
his career and his work on The Revenant really is up there as some of
the best I have ever seen, his wide shots showcasing the vast and
beautiful mountainous terrain and his long takes during the opening
battle sequence, taking us from tussles on the floor to horseback in
one flowing motion, setting the film off in such pulsating fashion.
Lubezki has won the last two Academy Awards for cinematography, expect
the third one to be his come the end of February.The film's length has come under a bit of scrutiny but I could have
easily sat through a further half hour, I was that engrossed in Glass'
search for revenge. The film is a basic tale of survival and revenge
yet, through Inarritu's filmmaking choices and narrative, there feels
so much more to it all. There is one intense scene that has already made the headlines for all
the wrong reasons and that is the moment Glass is mauled by a grizzly
bear. Obviously created through CGI yet feeling as real as anything
else in the film, it really is an outstanding moment that I will just
have to wait for the blu-ray to see just how they did it.Coming to the performances, The Revenant is just as strong as other
departments. Leonardo DiCaprio leads the film as Hugh Glass and it's
much more of a physical performance than anything else, using his eyes
and facial expressions to great effect throughout. By the end, you feel
as if you have gone through everything, from freezing cold conditions
to eating just about anything to survive, with Glass. While I don't
think this is his best performance, it's still one of such a high
standard and I will be cheering him on for the much coveted Academy
Award for Best Actor.DiCaprio is joined by an impressive supporting cast, headed by the
always impressive Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald. Hardy again possesses a
bit of mumble here though it's not hard at all to make out what he is
saying but I did notice more than ever in this Hardy performance just
how much he uses his eyes in his acting. Domhnall Gleeson and Will
Poulter are also on hand to provide able support, Gleeson as Captain
Andrew Henry and Poulter as the naive Jim Bridger.I am aware that, like many of the films going for gold during awards
season, The Revenant has leaked online however, I urge you to seek it
out at your nearest cinema because it really is an immersive cinematic
experience that simply has to be seen on the big screen.

Looks like the Internet already found a winner for the upcoming Academy
Awards when it comes to the category "Best Actor". Stories of how
Leonardo actually slept in a carcass and ate bison liver in order to
prepare for the role made its round. I think it is certainly most
honorable to prepare that obsessively for a role, but that's not what
constitutes a great actor - not alone at least, otherwise we could have
given Bear Grylls some Emmys already, what actually does not seem like
a bad idea either, but back to the Revenant. In the end DiCaprio's
portrait of what Glass might have been like is quite intense and
gritty, but to me it also seems over the top at times. I didn't really
believe any of his relations with the Indians, the Character somewhat
falls flat. And that's the next problem this movie is facing. It seems
like Iñárritu wanted to mix his story of a man overcoming the odds in
the face of death all too bad with a political statement of how bad the
white people were and how good and noble the Indians were. To me the
characters are all portrayed too black and white, with only little
shades of grey in between. Every Indian is good, white men mostly bad.
From what history taught us about these days, this holds up to the
truth to a certain degree, but still it does not really fit into the
story. The movie would have worked perfectly well without Glass having
an Indian wife and a son. All this dream sequences and flashbacks about
him moaning his dead relatives, were nearby ridiculous at times. Yet
one has to remark, that the Indians had some badass moments, that
helped to carry the film. As well as the cinematography did. Oh boy, it
certainly looks like Lubezki is about to get his third Oscar in a row
for this one. The way he captured the landscape and follows the battle
scene, this really gets you into the movie. As the credits rolled I was
glad, that I watched it in the cinema, mostly because of the stunning
visuals, the story itself is a great vengeance story as well, driven by
a great cast (cheers to Tom Hardy who seems to be in the prime of his
life) but I somewhat feel like it could have been a masterpiece, if
only Iñárritu wouldn't have gone too far making it really kitschig and
too much of a cliché at times. Still, good movie, recommend watching it
in the cinema.

Okay, this is a really good action film, but it's too gory and
predictable. Fitzgerald is an irredeemable bad guy. The entire scenario
was too good to be true. Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific in acting the
part but his character had not 9 but 10 lives in this movie. How is it
possible for a person near death to survive so many ordeals? The one
with jumping off a cliff and surviving the fall when still very much
not in great shape is remarkable and unbelievable to me. Of course, I
knew the fate of the captain at the end before viewing the last scenes
and DiCaprio's trick to get Fitzgerald at the end was used in a
previous movie. This flick reminded me of the one with Robert Redford
in Jeremiah Johnson. Tom Hardy played Fitzgerald very well, but it was
difficult at times for me to understand what he was saying.

This is one of those movies that is really hard to review because there
is so much to look at and inspect. Its like doing an experiment you
must look at the data many times before coming up with a conclusion to
write about. The cinematography in this movie is the FUTURE. Many will
try to re-create and copy what this film has done, but all will fall
short. This movie has some of the most jaw-dropping scenes today in the
film industry. The bear scene brings CGI to an entirely new level,
which many thought was unimaginable. Unfortunately I believe many will
critic this movie for its brutality realistic scenes. The amount of
effort that went into this movie alone should be enough to earn its
spot on top. I wanted to give this movie a 10 so bad but there was just
some reason inside that I could not, yet I thought about the movie all
day and couldn't think of anything wrong with it; so I came to the
conclusion that it is one of those movies that you need to see multiple
times before you can even begin to appreciate all the beauty it brings.
Leo gives an A1 performance but I can still see the Academy finding a
way to not give an Oscar for some technicality like "He didn't have
enough lines". Really Tom Hardy was the one that took over any time he
was on screen, when he was on screen things were happening and you
waited intensely for what he might say next. The ending to this movie
was a dream for me and will I already consider it one of my favorite
scenes of all time. This movie needs to be watched and studied to even
begin to appreciate what Gonzalez has brought to his viewers.

The Revenant, the movie that will give Leonardo DiCaprio his first
Oscar. For the second time in the last two years we have been blessed
by the extraordinary vision and direction of director Alejandro
González Iñárritu. Iñárritu brought this amazing story Hugh Glass, the
frontiersman, fur trapper, and explorer that was mauled by a grizzly
bear and ultimately left for dead by the company that hired him. The
film follows the theme of the will to survive, bringing the audience to
question, What would you do to survive?Leonardo DiCaprio will win his first Oscar for his role as Hugh Glass.
If he does not win the award there is something wrong with the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The scenery was amazing and to
know that the film was shot with no artificial light. With Iñárritu at
the forefront again don't be surprised to see him win for best director
again and it sure looks promising that The Revenant will win Best
Picture. I urge you to see this film because of the trials and tribulation that
Hugh Glass went through. The shot selection that Iñárritu used was
fantastic and personally I wouldn't change it. From the opening body
camera to the closing close up, the film kept you engaged and wanting
more. Alejandro González Iñárritu may not be the easiest man to work with in
the film industry but he sure knows how to direct and how to make
something truly fantastic. Though certain characters didn't have the
most dialogue, what they did say ended up leaving more of an impact.
Tom Hardy was fantastic as John Fitzgerald and really did a good job
convincing the audience that he was doing the right thing throughout
the movie. Overall the film was great and will pull in some awards and people like
DiCaprio and Iñárritu will be recognized for their work. The film
emotionally connected with audiences challenging them to put themselves
in Glass' situation. It calls into morally what one would do, as well
as, spiritually what one would do. The quotes "I ain't afraid to die
anymore. I'd done it already" really makes the audience fell for Glass
and that all he does to survive and his actions are justifiable and
that it is true that he has died and does not care if he does so again. As I finish, I would give this movie an 8.8 out of 10 and for one last
time I applaud the job Iñárritu did directing and the performance of
DiCaprio and Hardy as well as others like Will Poulter and Domhnall
Gleeson. I will leave you with the quote that stuck with me and really
ties the movie together. After watching the film really think about
this quote,"Revenge is in god's hands not mine"Thank you for reading,David Horvath

Based on a book of the same name by Michael Punke, this is the tale of
frontiersman Hugh Glass and his battle against the harsh climate of the
Montana and South Dakota in order to exact revenge.A revenant in European folklore is a corpse rising from the dead and
terrifying the living and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is
outstanding as his journey has him straddling the border between alive
and dead. The acting here is largely physical and as he jumps in the
icy water, is buried alive and eats raw meat, his suffering is
incredibly vicarious to the view. It is a film of both survival and
revenge; in essence they are both interrelated as it is his desire to
avenge his son's death which is keeping him alive.The cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is just stunning as the entire
film is shot in natural light and most of it in that "golden hour"
shortly before sunset. The landscape is visceral and you can almost
feel the chill of the Midwestern air through the cinema screen. And
though the grizzly bear scene may well be artificial compared to the
rest of the film it was certainly no less intense.But in a strange way, the problem with The Revenant may well be its
photography. The film is in love with the scenery so much that it
becomes an art installation at times and the overlong run-time can
possibly be blamed on this. I also had issues deciphering Tom Hardy's
American accented dialogue on occasion and this is a problem in a film
where relatively few lines are said. There is also an awkward
spirituality aspect to the film which appeared to be crow-barred in
simply because the film is set in Native Indian territory.It is a terrific cinematic experience visually and this will probably
get Leonardo DiCaprio his Best Actor Oscar. However, it is certainly
not the best film of the year. To misquote Thomas Hobbes, The Revenant
is nasty, brutish and long.

Since there are already reviews on here that have broken "The Revenant"
down way better than I will, I'll just say this -- it's a movie. If you
want to watch something for the experience of having watched it because
everyone else is buzzing, you won't be disappointed. It'll give you the
few choice scenes to keep you in conversations, but I don't think it
has nearly enough substance to resonate with someone looking for
something more. Personally, I find this movie to be extremely overrated. Not in the
sense that it's terrible, but in the sense that it's amazingly average.
All the criticisms I've read from other people are fair in saying that
the character development is flawed and that you don't engage enough
emotionally to really care when something dramatic happens. Unless
you're an avid movie buff who can survive on almost 3 hours of torture
and brutality for an easily predictable ending, I certainly wouldn't
recommend this film to you. It lacks, in my opinion, a strong enough foundation to really make you
concerned over any of the characters well-being...Including Glass
(played by DiCaprio). You may be able to feel for the physical pain
he's suffering throughout, but his emotional journey didn't resonate
with me in the least. His deceased wife only exists in glimpses of his
near-death flashbacks, and he and his son exchange maybe 10 lines of
actual dialogue with each other. The rest of the film can be summed up
with a lot of crawling, a lot of grunting, and a slow (but steady)
progression from a should-be-dead man to a hobbled guy with nothing to
lose and revenge on his mind. And from the moment he's wronged, you know what Glass's story arc's
going to be. There's very little deviation from what you think's going
to happen and what actually happens...Save a few close calls and
run-ins to break up the monotony of all that crawling and grunting, of
course. All in all, I'd rate this film at a 4/10. I didn't love it...I
wouldn't recommend it to many people...And I have no intention of
watching it again. I think the Oscar really was an "I Owe You" to Leo
more than it was an actual validation of the film itself. Or maybe this
year's crop of movies just weren't all that great. Either way, watch
with caution...It may not be as amazing as your friend seems to think
it is.

I honestly don't know what to think of this movie. It's good in a way
and at the same time awful. To begin with, the idea to the story is
interesting. It's set in the 19th century which makes the scenario more
complicated than it would be today. But then there is this whole
father/son scenario which really makes no sense and seems out of place.
There is some back story to it that is scattered out through the film
and I understand it's there to add some tension to the movie, but there
is no build up to make you feel anything about it and in the end it
seems boring and pointless.It is well made though and most of the scenes seems very real and
believable. I sometimes grasped the chair grinning cause I really felt
the reality and pain in it. The bear attack for one stands out. The
acting is very good and the actors do as much as they can with the
script they're given, but as much as I believe Di Caprio deserves an
Oscar, I really don't think this role was the one.The plot could have been more interesting. It looks a bit like they
tried to make another "Deliverance" but failed in character development
and gravity of the story. Along the way I lost interest since
everything seemed to be based around how everything in the wild hurts,
and the main character is hurt a lot. Still he seems to survive
anything that happens to him, sometimes in the most obscure ways. At
the end I didn't really care whether or not he was going to make it
back home, even less if he was going to be able to avenge his son,
because nothing felt dangerous anymore. I was just hoping for the movie
to end because it felt way too long. They could easily have made this
an hour shorter which I think would have made it more exciting and less
dragged out.Warning! Spoilers ahead!There were a number of things bothering me about this movie but what
bothered me the most is that there is a huge lack of credibility
throughout some parts of it, especially since it's supposed to be based
on real events: Mostly I was annoyed by the fact that he seems to take any chance he
has to jump into the water and have a swim. Everyone who has been
living in a place cold enough for it to snow during the winter knows
that falling into ice-cold water when it's that cold outside, is equal
to freezing to death if you don't manage to get out of your clothes and
get warm somehow. Yet he barely seems to freeze at all. It's snowing
and there are ice floes in the water for God's sake! In reality he
would have been dead by the time he reached the riverbank, and
certainly after his "nap". Seems like the movie makers forgot to do
some research about hypothermia. After the bear attack his foot is clearly broken and points in the
wrong direction. Yet he manages to crawl off and swim down the rapids
in ice-cold water only to be able to walk out of the river on his now
miraculously healed foot. The only problem to him surviving seems to be the injuries he suffered
from the bear attack. I mean he even rides off a cliff and survives the
fall only to miraculously survive yet another cold night of snow
storms.Why do they eat raw meat when they clearly have made a fire two steps
away where they could cook it? It makes no sense.All the lines delivered by the native Americans seemed out of sync for
some reason, which is weird since todays technology in syncing picture
and audio is quite developed.All in all it's an interesting story but a bit boring and unbelievable
way to tell it. I would have bought it if it was a fictional story, but
this time it's based on real events. If you want to revel in pain,
suffering and misery, and if you like to watch a movie about how hard
it was back in the 19th century, please go ahead, but there are better
ways to spend your money.

First of all, I very much like survival movies in the wild. I also am
interested in the history of the era and location. The trappers, the
Métis, the different Indian nations and bands, the voyageurs, the men,
the (indigenous) women,... And the film starts promising with great
photography and a fitting score. Everything seems set for a
breathtaking movie. Alas, it soon turns out that the characters are
totally underdeveloped. Especially the main character and his son. We
know little about them except for the tragedy that befell their wife /
mother. It leaves us in the cold with not even a carcass to hide in.
The revenant is a caricature of groaning and limping. Not such good
acting at all. Then Leonardo deserved it far more in other films such
as "J. Edgar". The opening battle scene is spectacular, but largely
unrealistic. The motivation for the attack is also ambiguous and
far-fetched. A historical travesty. The daughter of the Arikara chief
was supposedly kidnapped by a group of voyageurs, apparently as it
turns out later for the sake of lust and sadism. Why would the
voyageurs deliberately make enemies in such a way while there was much
more to be gained by a Marriage 'à la façon du pays' with an Indian
woman of importance? This was far more the custom with them than with 
what the director would call  "the Anglos". The relations between the
French-speaking voyageurs and the natives was in general a lot better
than between the Americans and the natives. The voyageurs needed local
allies and suppliers of food far more than the Americans with their
forts. In fact one of the reasons for the Arikara war was that the
Americans undermined the position of the Arikara of middlemen in the
fur trade. But Hollywood has to give it a spin and introduce and
outside source of absolute evil. All of the other protagonists have
rational motivations  even John Fitzgerald and mother bear. Then the
film becomes simply ridiculous when  after being badly mauled by the
bear and having had to recover for a lengthy period  the hero stumbles
upon the kidnapped girl and frees her from the camp of voyageurs (who
else?) while the Arikara supposedly attacked the Americans to steal the
pelts to trade them for horses from voyageurs in order to be able to
catch up with the kidnappers, who must have left easy tracks in the
snow and barren winter landscape. Go figure! Finally when the revenant
has recovered from his terrible wounds and infections he goes after
John Fitzgerald for a two-way slaughter party of gaping wounds. I guess
there was not enough blood yet for an Oscar-worthy movie?

Translated from 3rd January reviewExcellently acted, directed and filmed (especially filmed), The
Revenant didn't however manage to captivate me once in its 150 minutes.
Which means I had a lot of time to think about "Why?". It's because
such a movie is useless to our world. The story isn't interesting, or new, there isn't a single theme that
wasn't presented in the exact same way in a previous film. You won't
see any new ideas or techniques that would justify the making of this
film except that they wanted to make an Oscar film. The director
wanted to show off his skill, the same for the actors and technicians.
So, they found an old story that would let them shine AND which
traditionally catches the eye of the Oscar crowd. It's true, they added
a modern angle to the treatment of the indigenous population by the
white invaders but, it's nothing special either. I don't want this
review to be negative. Tom Hardy gets completely lost in the role of
Fitzgerald. DiCaprio is again fantastic in a slightly unusual role
compared to what he played in the last few years. Where he played more
verbally than physically. (Screaming his way through half of those
films. Hugh Glass is a tragic character, a survivor, beaten down by the
world of 1820's, not one who pumps his chest, getting ready to take on
any adversary in his way. (Yes I'm talking about The Wolf of Wall
Street here). Directing is, again, excellent. Inarritu demonstrating
that he can also direct calm, somber and atmospheric scenes without
dialogue. But, if it weren't for Emmanuel Lubezki, the movie wouldn't
look, or flow nearly as well. Those in the sound department also pull
their weight marvelously. It's very difficult to capture that feeling
of solitude in the wilderness, but they managed to do it in this film.
You can really feel the cold, the dampness and the loneliness, wherever
you are while watching The Revenant. I don't want to take away from The
Revenant any one of these technical achievements but that's the
problem: it's a lot more of a technical spectacle than a story worth
telling than a great film. Sort of a Transformers for the Oscar crowd.

*Doesn't contain any huge spoilers: just one scene*After literally just getting back from seeing The Revenant, I decided
to share my opinion of it prior to the Oscars before it becomes even
more hyped up. While Leonardo DiCaprio does deliver an incredible performance, making
the audience feel his pain and helplessness in certain situations, I
found myself often comparing his facial expressions and noises to the
scene in The Wolf of Wall Street where his character consumes some
surprisingly powerful quaaludes ultimately dropping him directly into
the "cerebral palsy phase". I found it somewhat difficult to contain my
laughter after making this comparison during the film. Putting that
aside, his portrayal of a character determined to have his revenge was
impressive.That being said, even within the opening scenes of the film I found
myself focusing more on Tom Hardy's performance. Whether it was his
character or his acting that caught my attention, I couldn't tell you.
Following the "evil" character in the film added a sense of dramatic
flare that we don't always see. Watching as he deals with each and
every consequence as it unfolds, watching how little effect this has on
his conscience. Short of putting any real spoilers in here, Tom Hardy
in my opinion played an essential role in the success of this film. Overall, I would certainly recommend this film to people because it is
a great watch but I also won't be rushing to purchase the DVD upon its
release. The story tends to drag in points and many aspects of the
story that would have been interesting to see are left unexplored.
Perhaps this was to add a degree of mystery to the film but I think it
would have helped flesh out the story a little more.

Most are already written by reviews of this movie here. Most words are
already used, and many good reviews as well. Therefore will I do this
review short about what I experienced as negative with this in many
ways very great movie. The story is good and the action is intense.
Lenoardo Di Caprio make an amazing effort. My objection to this movie
is the brutality. For my part, it was all too much violence and
brutality. This violence lasts throughout the film, and makes one gets
tired of watching it. I think that this story fine could have managed
without the explicit violence scene, even the famous scene with the
bear that attack. That makes this movie difficult to watch, and I think
that it may be too violent for many. There is not anyone who can stand
or withstand to see such things, and this review is therefore a
reminder to these, and the film should be considered carefully. Beyond
that'll probably be many awards at this forward, and it will maybe be
considered a classic in the years to come. The environment this film
takes place is in is beautiful filmed. But the film had been just as
good without the blood and the brutality.

Having read some reviews purporting this movie to be spellbinding and
movie of the year I ventured to the cinema expecting to be blown away.The visually stunning story of Hugh Glass frontiersman and pioneer told
with Hollywood inaccuracies and the pace of a snail.I was familiar with the story having read a book on Glass years ago in
school but was totally disappointed by the deviation to a straight
story of revenge.Don't get me wrong it's beautifully made and at times
quite haunting but the length and pace as the ending are a let down.The opening scene and bear attack were stunning but after the tree
sequence my wife remarked the movie was turning into Rambo.The true events of what happened after the attack are fascinating and
not how they were portrayed in the movie ( the revenge aspect ) as
Glass did hunt the two men down, forgiving the younger but unable to
administer any retribution to the other for fear of being punished.All in all a good movie but not great or exceptional. The cast were all
superb but the movie just lacks the X factor for me.

Spit, dirt and painful faces. That was a first sentiment of mine about
this movie. It surely is gritty picture of settler, but after tenth
time when Leonardi Di Caprio rescues himself from certain death
everything starts to feel too unbelievable. I am certain that many of
you disagree, but for me this movie is boring and predictable. There is
a lot of beautiful scenery, maybe even too much to handle. You could
easily cut this movie under two hours length instead of over two and
half an hour length without any suffering for the storytelling. Maybe
this is what they call an artistic of a movie what it needs to take
notice in Oscars. Probably it will get more than ten nominees, but is
it really worth it? I am quite definite that Leonardo will pick an
Oscar of best leading actor, because there are enough of spit, pus and
painful faces and if that is all it needs. At the beginning of a movie
is very realistic Indian attack scene, almost a racist. Attack of a
bear is also very well done and it gives a strong start for a movie.
Unfortunately magic vanish quite quickly. Somehow you just start to
wait the end scene. Everything that happens in between star and the end
starts to feel just vain. The Revenant is well produced drama, but at
the same time it is boring and predictable. It is very patriotic and
I'm sure the old members of actors guild will love it so much that many
Oscars are pretty undisputed. To me it was just too lame and boring.

The title of this review sums it up almost perfectly. The film does
have major strengths but also has major weaknesses. While intense at
certain points, it gets as vague as hell in others which kills the
narrative drive and tension of the film. Also, another problem with
this is my age as in the I have lived long enough to have seen and
remember films of similar stories and themes. With "The Revenant", I
had felt like I was watching a variation of a theme that I had seen
before. That is bad for a film because it jerks the viewer out of his
enjoyment of the film. Every film should make you feel that you are
seeing something new and unique even if it isn't. With me, I had
thought I was watching a variation of "The Naked Prey (1965). While the
Naked Prey film was set in Africa, the historical event that it is
based on, Colter's Run, happened in North America, in Yellowstone park,
just like The Revenant. And both Colter and Glass were guides and
experienced mountain men. The stories were too similar. And it didn't
help that I had just finished reading a novel that had mentioned
Colter's Run shortly before seeing this movie. Bad timing on that. As
far as acting goes, I was not particularly empressed by Dicaprio's
performance and felt it was the weakest of the major players of the
film. I thought Will Poulter's was the best and stole the show. Gleason
and former child star, Lukas Haas, gave strong performances. Hardy was
good, but frankly, there was points where I couldn't understand what
the hell he was saying because the accent he had used was so thick and
he had mumbled some of his lines. But in the end, the strength of the
story and the directing did pull me in and I did feel emotion at what
was happening on screen which a good film should do. So therefore, I
say this film has both good points and weaknesses. I will say that if
you are looking for a fast action packed film, this not the film for
you since this film takes it's time (aka, "slow"), and builds towards
it's ending that doesn't really pay out.

From one side the movie made with very close-to-real picture that
showed how thing where at that times. The way the camera shows nature,
like dirt, snow, rain and the way that camera shows people, how thy
live - simply amazing. Very good job for camera and realistic picture.
Very nice Dolby Atmos sound effects.From other side story is very simple, old and bored: pain from loosing
close people then revenge from a "superman". Jesus. So boring. Only
camera, picture and costumes made me watch it till the end. Regarding the play of main actor - Expressing physical and psychic pain
with the same face mimic almost all time of the movie ...That can do
almost every person in the world. You don't need to go study to be
actor for that.Verdict: Worth to watch it. Worth Oscar for picture, camera work and
production. Worth Oscar for the main role - if it goes to the bear, but
not to Di Caprio

The Revenant is truly something to behold. It's beautifully shot and
maybe even more impressively directed. This could have easily gone awry
in the wrong director's hands, but Alejandro Iñárritu makes it look too
easy.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a fur trapper in the American Northwest in
1823. He and his crew are on the run after escaping a Native American
ambush. One day, after going off on his own, he is attacked and
savagely injured by a grizzly bear in a scene that will stay with you
for a very long time. It might be one of the most intense sequences in
film history. Nearly dying, he is deemed, by Tom Hardy's character, as
too risky to be carried along with them, so Hardy leaves DiCaprio to
die.The film is really long, but riveting. Not once does your mind wander
to something else. Scene after scene is like nothing you've seen
before.This film is about revenge, but it's also about moral decisions. It's
never preachy, but those who wish to get something out of it will. It's
hard to watch, but completely rewarding in the end. And there may have
never been such a dark film that is also this beautiful to look at.Tom Hardy, while audibly incomprehensible at times, plays grimly
sadistic to perfection. From the beginning, he walks around like
nothing ever bad is going to happen to him. He's cocky, but there's
something subtle in his tone that makes you believe that he's unsure of
himself subconsciously--even though he thinks no one notices. Perhaps
they don't. It's a no brainer that DiCaprio has given the best performance of the
year, even if just for his commitment to making his character real. The
film is shot in actual freezing temperatures and throughout the entire
thing you really do feel his pain--just from the piercing cold itself.
He's in a league of his own with this one. But if we're going to talk about commitment, we must also discuss
Iñárritu's insistence that there will be no green screen used and
everything that happens will be happening for real. Last year,
Iñárritu's film Birdman won the Oscar for Best Picture. This is a step
even above that. Birdman was filmed in a controlled setting. Watching
The Revenant, you feel like everyone on set is playing with fire. The
fact that they get a breathtaking film out of it is superbly
impressive.Twizard Rating: 100

"The Revenant" is brilliant. It is a bleak film about revenge, survival
and the Human Spirit. It is pure Cinema and needs to be seen on the big
screen to fully appreciate it. It is intense, thrilling and a very
immersive experience. It fully justifies its length. Give Leo Dicaprio
that damn Oscar. He was great and shows once again what a versatile
Actor he is. Tom Hardy and Will Poulter deserve major credit as well.
Hardy might have been doing anything one of his trademark "voices", but
he was stellar as a wide eyed, unhinged, and aggressive villain. The
much hyped Bear scene was terrifying and brutal. The fight scene at the
end has to be the most gory and intense fight scene since "The Raid 2".
I swear even Tarantino would have said this movie was too brutal at
times. This movie made Bear Grylls look like a Poser. Everything was on
point in this movie, from the acting to the directing and
cinematography. Alejandro Inarritu deserves the Best Director Oscar
again. The man's passion shines on screen. If this movie wins Best
Picture I won't mind because I can't really fault it. It's definitely a
Must See for both Men and Woman. 10/10

This movie surpassed my all expectations, I felt all kinds of emotions
with this movie, desperation, anger, hope, intrigue, solitude and many
more, and let me tell you, those are emotions very hard to get from me
just by watching a movie. That is thanks to the magnificent acting of
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, both of them are two of the greatest
actors of their generation.This movie is relative long but I connected so much with the main
character that the time distorted and it felt longer because you can
feel the character's pain and this is one of the few movies that even
being long you feel is so short, you just enjoy every second, you taste
it like enjoying your favorite meal.In simple words, watch it and you wont regret even one minute.

The point of the original story totally misinterpreted. The OG was
about vengeance with forgiveness but at the end !! Why the need for so
many Hollywood-style unnecessary story expansions (killed a bear on His
own ??, why the need for killing soon ??, ..)? Too much alike "The Grey" movie and some parts, Obviously REPLICATED.Casting ?? Hardy 1a just perfect, wouldn't be a great choice for a lead
roll. Di Caprio in my opinion not Appropriate (not man enough). Great
picture, scenery.Acting;OK to great; with to much suffering on Leonardo face in some
scenes.Biggest flaws .-Dead horse scene, haha common totally surrealistic. - artificial wind
making is really a comedyBottom line: Boring stretched movie from a director that doesn't
understand the true nature of NATURE. So Inarritu, please stick to
urban environment, don't make a shame of yourself."The Edge"with A.
Hopkins as lead role is far better movie and you should look up to it.

By far much more than a simple story of survival, here it is: the proof
that cinematography is not dead. An amazing blend of stunning visuals,
exceptional soundtrack, an unparalleled story and incredible acting.
Almost every single shot of this masterpiece is filled with symbolism
and emotions like I've rarely seen in a movie. It is really
heartwarming to see an artistic creation of this magnitude get the
production it deserves. It has instantly become one of my favorite
movies ever made and I can see the director, Alejandro González
Iñárritu, sitting alongside timeless geniuses such as Stanley Kubrick,
Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky. The Revenant feels so natural and
with one long shot after another brings a considerable amount of
emotional stress on the viewer. It also has something that I thought
was long dead in cinematography: quiet time. Atmospheric moments with
no dialogue whatsoever paint an emotional canvas that is sure to move
even the most stone-hearted viewer. Iñárritu's masterpiece is a movie
for the mature and intelligent cinephile and I have only words of
praise for it. Fantastic.

The Revenant, (n. one who has returned, as if from the dead). The
Revenant is a beautiful piece of cinematic art. First I will address
the quality of the film. This movie is, in my opinion, unmatched by any
other film in history in terms of its cinematography (props to Emmanuel
Lubezki). Each scene begins, and sometimes ends, with a breathtaking
shot of an equally breathtaking landscape. Each shot is essential to
the scene's content. The direction is masterful. Inarritu once again
managed to outdo himself. Every single scene has a purpose. Every
single shot a meaning. Every word a purpose. The acting is superb. I
will not buy into the "overdue Oscar" hype. Everyone who has won the
Award for best actor deserved it. I will however note that none come
close to DiCaprio's performance this year. No one could have brought
the emotion that Leo brought to Hugh Glass. With none but a few lines
of dialogue, Leo's acting has stunned me like never before. Hardy
exemplified evil in a way that I haven't seen since Anthony Hopkins in
The Silence of the Lambs, Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and Javier
Bardem in No Country for Old Men.On to the film itself. I've seen so many people cite this film as
simply a revenge western, a biopic adventure, and a survival movie.
While it certainly employs aspects from all three of these, it isn't
any one. This film is about life versus survival, man vs. beast, and
the relationship between parent and child, love and revenge. It
accomplishes its goals just as beautifully as its cinematography
accomplishes its trip to the Oscars.The environment of The Revenant is a violent and unforgiving one. It
does not care whether you live or die. This is essential to the films
success. The entire film is really a case study of the human spirit.
Think about the bear. The bear is in the same environment as Hugh
Glass. It faces the same dangers and difficulties. It has to eat,
drink, and survive just like Glass. And it will do anything, I repeat,
anything, to ensure the safety of itself and its children, including
kill. In many ways, Glass is just like the bear. Glass is thrust into
the brutal world of The Revenant and is forced to survive. Unlike the
bear, protecting his child is not enough. If the bears cub is killed,
she will not avenge it. She will not crawl from her grave, half- dead,
to find the one who stole her child. Glass is human. There is more to
life than survival. And he makes that all too clear. The film
emphasizes his struggle to survive, but his struggle to survive is
fueled by the struggle to live. The bear attacked Glass because she saw him as a threat to her cubs.
Glass attacked Fitzgerald because he killed his son. The difference
between life and survival, in the minutes leading up to the haunting
ending, is that life demands vengeance, while survival demands only
breathing (although this assertion is strongly challenged in the last
15 seconds of the movie.)All throughout the movie, Glass is portrayed as a bear-like creature.
He eats raw buffalo, he grabs fish out of the river and rips into them,
he sleeps naked inside an animal carcass. But why? To survive? No, he
should have died. By all odds, he would have died. Why didn't he?
Because the need to live, not survive, live, drove him out of his
grave.The subplot serves to further reinforce the strength of a parent- child
relationship. The Indian chief will stop short of nothing to find his
missing daughter. He slaughters hoards of people to find what was taken
from him. The ending. The seemingly unanswered question is this: was Glass
staring emptily into the camera because he had not killed Fitz, but
rather allowed his fate to be decided by the chief, or was it because
he had fulfilled his quest for vengeance and felt no satisfaction? I
choose to believe the latter, that after crushing death to find life,
and completing his mission, he felt no satisfaction. Life, is more than
revenge. His son was gone, he needed to accept this. This point is
further reinforced by the grateful nod of the chief and his daughter as
they ride past. The chief sought life, and found his daughter. He found
life. Glass found revenge. He thought he was finding life, but he only
found empty satisfaction. Why did his wife walk away form him at the
end? Was she approving or disapproving of his actions? Throughout the
movie, her words drove him forward, but, now that he reached his
destination, she no longer is there to drive him. I see this as,
"You've completed your mission. But, as Fitz said "Ain't nothing gonna
bring him back". What will you do now? Will you succumb to death? Or
will you truly find life?" That question rung in my head for the
seconds of blackness following his empty and seemingly hopeless stare,
and has rung for days after the credits rolled.

The name "Leonardo Dicaprio" has always attracted me towards movies and
most of the time it has paid dividends. The Revenant was the same case
however it did perform like my favourite soccer team scoring a goal in
the opening 10 mins and then losing the game 1-2. Everything in the
movie was a class itself except for the long long scenes which resulted
in the very long airtime. As far as the cinematography is concerned, simply outstanding and the
direction is superb. No recent movie that I saw shot such amazing
scenes of nature which made me in love with natural beauty of snowy
mountains. The acting by the whole cast is fantastic and hats off for Leo the way
he worked up his character. I would have liked to see some more role of
a girl in this story as her absence dried up the whole movie and all
most of the girls rated this movie as a guy flick. On the whole, a good movie which could hAve done a lot more. In general
a bit slow but for all those who likes American History and War movies,
or students learning direction and acting, this is recommended.

I'm a sucker for films set in the 1800s, it's always been my favorite
period in history, so this film (Along with Hateful Eight) was a must
see. I haven't seen Alejandro González Iñárritu's previous film
Birdman, but considering the glowing reviews and Oscars, it must have
been good and I will see it when I get around to it. Simply put, this
is the second best movie of 2015 (After Mad Max: Fury Road). The
cinematography is breathtaking, showing off the unforgiving yet
beautiful scenery and the bear mauling scene is the most brutal bear
attack in cinema history. DiCaprio gives another great performance,
possibly his strongest yet, in a role that is almost dialogue-free for
the first hour. Props to Tom Hardy (Dark Knight Rises, Mad Max) for
once again disappearing into a role, this time as murderous fur trapper
Fitzgerald, he really is the new Daniel Day Lewis, there is no actor,
just a brilliant character. I saw the film twice, and loved it even
more the second time. Highly recommended.

The Revenant is set in a world full of interesting characters and huge
events. As so often happens, the film-makers picked out one white man
and put him in the spotlight, fading everything around him into a blur.
Don't expect the movie to discuss the rights of Native American and/or
women - they're passed over just like panoramas of snowy scenery.While Leonardo DiCaprio does some hardcore acting huffing, wheezing,
coughing up blood and crawling around, the script is such a one-man,
one-act show we don't really learn much about Hugh Glass, just that
he's a widow with a son and several life- threatening injuries. It's
debatable if his will to survive and get revenge can even be called
bravery.All that said, the movie is actually quite enjoyable to watch. (As long
as you're not bothered by blood and guts.) It's a long one, but the
pacing is fine. The visuals depend on good old-fashioned camera work
rather than hours of CGI, and when they do use CGI (yes, the famous
bear), it's so life-like you won't even spot it.

In "The Revenant" Leonardo DiCaprio is real-life fur trapper guide
named Hugh Glass. In the 1830s, Hugh and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk
(Forrest Goodluck) led a group of fur trappers in the forests he knew
so well. These men were at a high risk for animal attacks, Indian
attacks, and the unpredictable way winter can turn stormy and life
threatening. The leader of the fur trappers is John Fitzgerald (Tom
Hardy) and he and Hugh do not get along. In fact, John denigrates Hawk because of the boy's half Caucasian/half
Indian ancestry. Hugh keeps the peace between them, but it is short
lived. Hugh is alone in the woods watching a couple bear cubs whose
mother comes along and attacks him. Hugh kills the female bear with his
knife after she nearly kills him. The men make a stretcher of sorts for
Hugh, but hauling the man around in it in sub-zero weather is making
everyone tense.John asks Hugh if he should let him die and with the blinking of his
eyes, Hugh agrees to this. Just as John is ready to finish off Hugh,
Hawk intervenes and John kills the boy. John and his men dig a hole and
put Hugh in it after taking the man's gun. Hugh is barely alive and not
ready to throw off the mortal coil. He digs himself out and wants to
get revenge on the men who killed his son, took his gun, and left him
for dead.The revenant of the story is the wife and mother of Hugh and his son.
Huge's wife was killed when the Indian village was attacked. Her ghost
aka the revenant guides Hugh along his quest the men who left him for
dead. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful as the taciturn, honorable Hugh Glass
while Tom Hardy shines as the villainous John Fitzgerald who leaves
Hugh for dead. Hugh's near-death visions are touching but at the same
time frightening because he sees a nightmare character played by "Mama"
character Javier Botet. The struggle of Hugh Glass is not glossed over for the audience. His
determination to live is laid bare for all to see and Leo's expressive
face tells all. I do think this is a good movie to watch when it is 90
degrees outside because the cold beauty of winter can make one feel
like they are freezing! "The Revenant" is a bit long, but worth it at
the same time!

It remains hard to believe that Leonardo DiCaprio has won an Oscar, as
he is in Hollywood one of the few actors who year after year a "risk
having 'performance. For some he could get the statue as (The Departed,
Catch Me If You Can), others are in terms of film less dividends
despite its good role (The Aviator, The Great Gatsby). The fact is that
he has no Oscar stand in his trophy case full, even if there may come
with The Revenant finally change.The film tells the (remarkably true) story of adventurer and fur trader
Hugh Glass. The viewer is thrown directly into the action with a
beautifully filmed battle scene between the traders and the indigenous
population. Glass and what is left of his group managed to escape by
boat, but that all the drama begins. After finding a place to go ashore
to explore the Glass project. In the forest, however, he encounters an
angry grizzly bear attacking him to protect her little ones. Glass gets
injured while so that it does not appear that he will survive. A number
of men, including John Fitzgerald, indicates that it will continue to
Glass in exchange for a nice sum of money. Give too much of what
happens next, would be a shame. Without giving much price comes down to
Glass still is left and he should see a way back to employment through
the rugged landscape, where danger of nature and man constantly lurks.DiCaprio has after the attack the bear very little text in the film,
since he can not talk his injuries. But he knows every feeling that
Glass has his eyes and his grunts and groans make it clear. DiCaprio
and his will to live are at the heart of the film. But Tom Hardy as
Fitzgerald is almost as impressive. Hardy plays him thoroughly bad, but
surely you can understand his motivation somewhere.But the best of The Revenant is that the wonderful acting hand in hand
with the images of nature that take your breath away and continued to
emphasize the bar the circumstances in which Glass is located. To make
this as to capture (everything was filmed in natural light), were cast
and crew during the filming also through hell. But these difficulties
were worth it, the end result proves. Few movies you know as to give it
the feel of nature as Inarritu's The Revenant. Not only in acting
terms, we are dealing here with a special film as just be little, in
cinematic terms it really is a masterpiece.Review by FilmTotaal

It's the 1820s in Frontier USA. Left for dead, and having watched his
son die in front of him, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) begins an epic mission
of survival. With Tom Hardy (Legend), 2015's sweetheart Domhnall
Gleeson (Ex Machina) and Will Poulter (The Maze Runner), The Revenant
is directed by Birdman's Oscar-winning Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarittu.The Revenant is a truly beautiful film. Having heard the horror stories
of one of the most gruelling shoots ever, I was eagerly anticipating
it. Particularly admirable, though possibly insane, was the director's
decision to shoot in all-natural light, lending the film a stark,
realistic feel that really includes the viewer in Glass's struggle. By
the end, I felt cold and uncomfortable inside the stuffy cinema: a
definite achievement. And talking of uncomfortable, this is one of
those films you'd class as hard to watch. Evoking winces, groans, and
shape intakes of breath aplenty, the extent of DiCaprio's plight is
expertly depicted. Gruesome stand-outs include a scene of sleeping
inside a dead horse to avoid the cold (the realistic side of Empire's
famous Tauntaun scene), an jaw-dropping bear attack, Glass's final
confrontation with Hardy's Fitzgerald, and the opening scene, an
extraordinary fight scene between vengeful Native Americans and the
fur- trappers Glass belongs to. In the latter Iñarritu gets to display
his limitless propensity for tracking shots that he used to great
effect in Birdman, with the camera following one person until their
death, then following their killer similarly, and so on. Ultimately, a
truly spectacular feast for the eyes, with credit to both the director
and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, on course for a third consecutive
Oscar following Gravity and Birdman.Further praise must go to the acting. Obviously DiCaprio deserves all
the plaudits for a properly fantastic physical performance (though in
terms of his greatest career performance one feels The Wolf of Wall
Street should come more into play) yet at times he feels almost
overshadowed by the fabulous Hardy. Following up a solid year of Mad
Max: Fury Road and Kray biopic Legend (tragically unnoticed, like
Johnny Depp for Black Mass, by major awards), Hardy gives a perfect
villainous performance as the nihilistic, irreverent and self-
interested Fitzgerald, even if, like Tommy Lee Jones in No Country for
Old Men, his accent is thick enough to warrant subtitles. The two
central performances, supported by more solid work from Gleeson and the
increasingly respectable Poulter, in addition to the wonderful Duane
Howard as a Native American searching for his lost daughter, provide
the foundations for a properly epic film.Not that The Revenant is perfect; it's certainly overlong. Yet at the
same time it should not have been shorter - in order to achieve the
epic feel it had to be too long. There will always be redundant scenes,
and watching any man trudge through the wilderness will drag, even with
the beauty of the film and the class of acting. However, overall The
Revenant is hardly harmed by its flaws, earning its place among the
elite of 2015. 86/100 d

The Revenant tells the story of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who is
mauled by a bear and then left for dead by his hunting team. Following
this, Glass goes on a harrowing journey through the wilderness to find
and take revenge upon the man who left him to die. The Revenant is not
so much a film as a simulator. As Leonardo DiCaprio lives in the wild,
we live in the wild alongside him. We remain fully engaged in his story
and thanks to the stunning direction, every scene in involving and we
are there with the characters ever step of the way. Want to know what
it's like to live in the Alaskan wilderness? Look no further. As for
DiCaprio, he needs that Oscar now. He doesn't say much throughout the
film, yet he remains an emotionally devastating, engaging and fully
believable force of nature through the entire movie, and as a physical
performance it's truly astonishing. The Revenant is not an easy watch.
It's brutal, hard hitting and unbearably intense. To add to that it's
also a pretty sad movie as well. You may not enjoy it, but most will be
moved by it.It's not as good as Birdman, Alejandro González Iñárritu's last movie,
since it's too long and at times is just a bit too much. It's not
necessarily a film I'd be up for seeing again, but it's a monumental
achievement. The lack of plot is effective and allows the film to focus
on the hugely gut wrenching survival stuff while the themes of the
movie are subtle, but they're definitely there. This is deep in some
ways, but thankfully without shoving it down our throats. DiCaprio is
backed by several other fine performances, but even with DiCaprio's
amazing acting an argument could be made that Iñárritu is the star of
the show alongside cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. With some of the
most amazing cinematography of recent years, and some of the most
consistently involving, mind numbingly intense direction of the year,
The Revenant is a visual marvel. Overall, it's a really, really good
film with many incredible moments. It's bleak, breath-taking, powerful,
ferocious and harrowing. And that's just the bear attack scene.9/10

" The Revenant " direct to the Academy Awards. Why is there betrayal? Has always existed the revenge? What is
survival? Does God exist? These are some of the millions of unknowns
that the director Alejandro G. Iñárritu allows us to experience with
his cinematic gem. "The Revenant" a visceral but artfully delicate
piece that surpasses his previous project (Birdman or The Unexpected
Virtue of Ignorance) and marks a new era in the survival movies. Based on the 2002 novel by Michael Punke, chronicles the life of a man
of the 19th century that after a couple of misfortunes must survive and
seek revenge in a risky and hostile, territory, discovering that the
more dangerous is not abroad, the more dangerous is where can reach. It is a survival story, It's an ancient epic, It's a drama, It's a
western, It's a teaching and explanation of the spirituality of a human
being, It's all. Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu manage to create perfect
DNA between a frozen forest and a frosted heart questioning the human
potential to its maximum splendor. Although a little invisible, the spiritual concept of God is often
present in the development of the main characters (forgetting the
Indians red skin) around the film, hidden in some scenes but in others
this fully explicit (the analogy of Hardy between God and the
squirrel). Literally this movie is "in the hands of the creator", any
being that breath has reflected on their forehead the concept of a God,
for Glass his son and his wife, for Fitzgerald a profitable future, for
an Indian the loss of his daughter, In general are based on the
physical, making stress upon the strong Glass wounds, creating a very
temporary container to enter the presence of God. A measure that
advances added more and more injuries in the metaphysics of the
protagonist, but this only creates more strength in his head. DiCaprio is the touch of any movie, it has been part of Quentin
Tarantino in "Django Unchained", it has given it hand to Martin
Scorsese in "The Wolf of Wall Street" but not even "Django" or "Wall
Street" or "Titanic" Leonardo has made a physical, mental,
psychological and spiritual performance so overwhelming and complicated
as did with Alejandro. Walk dragged all the time, eat unimaginable
things, murder, fight, pretend, and burn in locations devastated, have
few hours of shooting, enduring cold, and experience work more complex
(in all senses) of his career. DiCaprio is a master, even when doing something as simple as a bath
naked, rimmed his physical scars and emotional in below-zero
temperatures. Will be this the Leonardo year? Hardy has not lost his
talent, especially coming from the infernal desert "Mad Max: Fury Road"
and the double performance of the gangsters in "Legend". He is alive,
again. Hardy takes part to give a bit of testosterone and to
demonstrate the customs of the (mostly male) Indians where kill, eat,
shoot, hunt and rape was the only thing that could make a few heads,
but that well was the 19th century. Inarritu assassinated our minds, ears, eyes and hearts with a close- up
images uncomfortable and bloody but both tense and exciting Open our
auditory canals with a battle with arrows, shooting and adrenalin and
close our eye focuses with blood, cold and fight. Number of elements
are used in the film, forming the perfect union of the director and the
crew a product with 12 nominations in the Academy Awards. "Birdman" most striking point was the apparent recording in only one
take, now, the point most visually striking was the Emmanuel Lubezki
stunning decision in record fully with natural light for once again
generating something new in the Hollywood world. Auditory and visual accompaniments are perfectly incorporated,
resonating strings and the ashes of a campfire is a clear example of
the excellent work done by Ryuichi Sakamoto , Alva Noto, and others,
having some results quite compelling. It is interesting that if we
think, usually all the films nominated for a statuette from the Academy
have such cohesion. DiCaprio, Hardy, Inarritu and the team effort is analogically in the
shedding of blood in the Glass front. Alejandro is breaking schemes,
limits and stereotypes of Hollywood. It is all proud to see that a
Latin American triumph in the most top of the podium. It makes me
dream, the show me that it is possible. "The Revenant" has shattered
its competitors and Gonzales stands out more and more, but, Have
already done so with "Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"?
"The Revenant" closes a year deepest with a flourish, being terribly
shocking and perfect, visceral, tremendous, real, spiritual, human,
natural, exceptional. And care! - "Alejandro González Iñárritu continue breathing"

DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, for roughly 30 minutes, then allows the
viewer to not have to hear his voice for the remaining 2 hours of the
film. And I'm sorry to say that his attempt to illicit my emotions with
just his expressions was a failure and only made me wish the bear had
finished him off...sorry. Nothing about this performance screams Oscar,
and none of his previous performances do either, which is why he
doesn't have one! Tom Hardy plays Fitzgerald, your standard ruthless, racist, Texas
d-bag, which he completely pulls off, with the exception of his voice.
If he had hit his mark, then perhaps this was award worthy but instead,
as with most of his other roles, he struggled with the accent and he
succumbed to mumbling and incoherent speech. A shame really, so close
to a perfect performance.Forrest Goodluck is perfect as Hawk, and honestly he could have pulled
off main character status had the film been centered around him! He was
flawless!!! I felt what he felt and all I wanted was more of all of it.
This kid will have no problem getting work in the future.If anything the DP deserves an Oscar for the stunning locations and
incredible aesthetics in this film but that unfortunately is all it
deserves. Cinematography was definitely the 12th man that brought this
film to its peak.

In the frigid wilderness of the Dakotas, a band of frontiersmen who
gather pelts (animal skins) for a living, are suddenly ambushed by a
Native American tribe with many being brutally slaughtered while the
rest escape on a boat. This opening sequence of Alejandro Iñárritu's
adaptation of Michael Punke's 'The Revenant' is among the most
thrilling since The Gladiator's opening. This tale of one animal
trapper's horrifying experiences in the harshest of environments is as
tedious and unforgiving as the surrounding environment and it forms the
perfect allurement for juries of various award ceremonies who dig the
silent, solitary performers. This might indeed be Leonardo DiCaprio's
long awaited Oscar but certainly not the most deserving one. After narrowly escaping the ruthless onslaught from the natives, the
frontiersmen decide to head to their outpost, Fort Kiowa. Unfortunately
though, in a brutal encounter with a mother grizzly bear, Glass
(Leonardo DiCaprio) is gravely injured, making the group's journey a
laborious task. The Captain offers a reward to those who would take the
responsibility to bring Glass to the Fort and so his son Hawk, Bridger
(Will Poulter) and the ever confrontational Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) drag
Glass over ice and hills until greed, apathy and selfishness within
Fitzgerald leave Glass alone in the wilderness with barely the ability
to walk. Apart from the bone chilling weather and lack of food, he must
now desperately find shelter from the Arikara tribe. The fates of every
character are linked. The tribe's chief is in pursuit of his kidnapped
daughter Powaqa which leads to them crossing paths with Glass' company.
Fitzgerald was once scalped by some natives and his undying hatred for
them leads him to mercilessly murder Hawk. Glass, though helpless for
much of the movie is driven by rage and the need for retribution which
turns into a desperate hunt when his company discovers Fitzgerald's
betrayal. The sun never shines with hope for anyone in the story. From diving
into the icy river full of rapids to finding shelter inside a dead
horse's carcass, Glass faces nature's harshness as he takes each step
in perpetual agony resulting from his injuries. Being mauled by a
ferocious bear can never lead to a speedy recovery but in 1823, being
abandoned for the dead, it just makes things a bit more challenging. There is no doubt that Leo's performance showcases a solid commitment
that anchors the film firmly. However, with fewer dialogues than any of
his movies to-date, his silent performance strongly indicates all but
one emotion; anguish. For over 2 hours, we are subjected to a helpless,
abandoned and weak Hugh Glass who trudges along gradually, with barely
the resolve to help overcome his pain. The depth of his coldness is
second to that of his surroundings that are harsh and brutal to any
survivor let alone one who was mauled by a grizzly. At times, his
survival is aimless and desperate while there are subdued emotions
portraying his desire for vengeance. Prolonged sequences of such
dullness can be engaging for serious cinema enthusiasts but the rest
will have to be satisfied with the stunning white backdrop of Canada
and Argentina that are supposed to match Dakota and Montana back in the
day. While this must've been an enormous challenge for Leo as an actor
in those harsh environments, it certainly isn't his best show.
Muttering, yelling and grunting lack the appeal of powerful dialogue
delivery that Leo is renowned for. Tom Hardy is impressive as the
cunning betrayer and with his thick accent and rough appearance, is
even difficult to identify. Director Iñárritu's vision for The Revenant was very personal even
though it drew inspiration from Michael Punke's novel. The opening
sequence involving the raid by the natives, the grizzly attack, the
sweeping shots of mountain ranges, blizzard conditions and even close
ups of the actors emoting make for some powerful narrative. Filming
during particular hours in the day just for a grim effect is the
hallmark of a passionate filmmaker and Iñárritu deserves the nomination
for his efforts. However, his overlong, tedious, cold and savage tale
of survival and determined vengeance must rather make way for the
survivor on another planet that offered more inspiration and
entertainment.- 7.431 on a scale of 1-10.

Is The Revenant the best movie of the year? Surely not and in fact it's
doubtful if it's a great movie at all. OK, so Alejandro Inarritu wanted
to be realistic, moved to Argentina for more snow, had actors crawling
naked in it and other bullshit like that, but seriously what is the
point of the film? And what is so realistic about getting almost raped
by a giant bear and attacked by uncountable Indians and elements of
nature but still managing to survive to get revenge? Inarritu is a
great director, perhaps the best (along with Christopher Nolan) of our
time and the movie is technically and artistically perfect. If he
hadn't already won the direction Oscar last year with Birdman, he would
certainly get this one. DiCaprio's performance is brilliant but so is
each and every of his performances. Still they'll finally grant him an
Oscar for his crawling and growling in the Revenant but in reality it
will be an Oscar for his entire career. Tom Hardy's performance is even
better and he deserves it even more than DiCaprio but he is going to
lose to ... Stallone (Jesus Christ Academy, you suck!). Nevertheless
and despite some very impressive scenes (namely the entrance scene, the
bear scene, the horse scene and the final revenge scene and that's it)
and artistic beauty, a movie should have a ... script and this one has
none. So it ends up being a Cast Away clone without the emotional touch
of the last.

Gotta be honest was bored watching this & had to rewind because I'd
zoned off elsewhere.. Yes there is some gore, a bear fight was a lil
scary.. But for the most part there just wasn't any character depth..
The only intriguing character for me was a native Indian that helps
DiCaprio & then with quick skills builds a shelter to protect
DiCapriofrom a blizzard, tthat guy I was fascinated with to see more
only for him to be bumped off. Tom hardy did a good accent in my
opinion & was kinda scary.. But for allthe attempts at stunts I was
just left unconvinced.. You are basically just watching DiCaprio
sleepwalk or waterslide through a long film

What the hell? Are you kidding me? This is just a miserable survivor
movie. The misty atmosphere is cool but it is not enough to make a
movie. LDC is really wasted here. Anyone can play his role, there is no
particular acting when compared to LDC's any other movie. He is just
crawling on the ground and murmuring. Wow what a performance! I am
really astonished! In terms of technical details there are a lot of goofs. The fight with
the bear is overly exaggerated. No one can survive such an attack in
those conditions. In one scene he is dragging his left leg and in
another scene the right one. There are many similar issues regarding
his survival. Through the end of the movie, Fitzgerald easily loots the
captain's safe which is ridiculous. And finally in the ending, Glass
sacrifices everything to kill Fitzgerald but what a coincidence that
there are readily available cutthroats just 10 meters downstream and he
wants the leave this pleasure to them. Haha it really did make me
laugh! Ohh was I supposed to cry, sorry guys but I laughed my a** off!!

...tried to make this movie, his first Oscar winning movie. But I am
afraid, you need to wait longer, Leonardo DiCaprio. Is not your fault.
Actually, I rated this movie a 7 because of your brilliant performance,
but I think the director wanted to .. "recreate" Interstellar , in
terms of drama, feelings and such. He kinda failed. He wanted to show
us the magnificent views he choose for this movie. He did that, but
man! don't just throw us scenes just for the sake of showing X
wonderful view. There were times when I was watching some random views
and told myself "why am I seeing this view? what this has to do with
the whole scene?" Yes! The scenes are beautiful, but still ..They should have focused more on the recovery of the character to make
the audience to actually see the movie with normal eyes. A lot of
scenes were "WTF" scenes, in a movie where they say is based on true
events.Anyway , I think this movie will move a lot more , parents , then the
rest of the viewers.!Next time Leo!Next time ..

Let me start the review by saying that I actually enjoyed this movie.
Sure it was much slower paced than most movies these days, but
honestly, it's a survival story. What did you expect? The movie, based
on a true story, centers around frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio) and his struggle to survive in the wilderness after John
Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and a young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) leave him
for dead following a near fatal bear attack. Along the way, Glass is
attacked twice by hostile Native Americans and manages to save an
enslaved Native American girl from some French bad guys before finally
being found by his exploration party. He and the leader of the party
set out to find Fitzgerald after Bridger is arrested for treason and
Glass eventually ends up killing Fitzgerald in a very well
choreographed fight scene.My main issue with the movie is the way they depicted Native Americans.
The natives were depicted as being hostile savages always out for blood
in the movie, only giving Glass a break after he saved one of their
people. The reality is that the Native Americans didn't start sending
arrows Glass's way whenever they caught a glimpse of him. They rushed
to help him and provided him with supplies and sustenance that he
probably would have died without. I thought we were beyond the idea
that Native Americans were mindless fighting machines that needed to be
put down by force. I guess the Emmy- winning Bury My Heart At Wounded
Knee taught the writers nothing. Or maybe they haven't even seen it.
Who knows.Another big issue this movie has is in the way it ended. In the movie,
Glass and Fitzgerald have one final bloody showdown. The fight is well
choreographed but ends somewhat anticlimactically when Glass sends a
dying Fitzgerald down the river (literally) to be scalped by Native
Americans (who, again, are mindlessly and illogically hostile). The
real confrontation was less violent but still interesting. After the
events that took place, the real Fitzgerald moved to Nebraska and
enlisted in the army at Fort Atkinson. The two had a confrontation but
Glass decided to spare Fitzgerald's life because of the heavy penalty
that came with murdering an enlisted army official. As for Jim Bridger,
Glass gave him a pass due to how young and naive Bridger was at the
time (he was still a teenager).My opinion has always been this: If you want to make a movie about a
fur trapper/explorer, go for it. If you want to loosely base it off of
true events, go for it. Many people do this and are successful at it.
As a standalone movie, The Revenant was good. And I understand that
it's based on a book of the same name, but I have qualms about the book
too.However, if you want to make a movie/book based entirely on a true
story, with the same character names, settings, etc., you have
something of a responsibility to depict it accurately. You can put some
embellished details here and there, that's fine, but twisting and
warping reality to fit your concept of entertainment is pathetic and,
to be frank, disrespectful to those involved. These were real people.
These were real events. Real lives were affected. And especially when
you paint Native Americans in such a disgustingly bad light, that's
where I draw the line.But I digress. Besides those major issues I have with the film,
everything else was very well done. The production, the CGI, the
acting, the dialogue (for the most part), the direction, etc. It was
all good and it all worked well together. Do I think it's a good movie?
For about the fourth-ish time, yes. Do I think it's a great movie? No,
not exactly, and even though I like it, I don't think it deserves all
the acclaim and attention it's getting. If it weren't for the major
issues listed above, this movie would have gotten an 8, easily. But I
also think it would have been just as interesting if they hadn't made
the Native Americans villain-like and instead showed them helping him
just as they did in real life. And to see Glass hunt down the man that
left him for dead, only to spare his life when he does find him? That
has a lot of emotional potential. I'm sure any director worth his
weight in gold could make that work.I give this movie a 6, but a reluctant 6 because I can tell they did
everything they could to make this movie entertaining.

The Revenant is not a great movie, it is a solid, sophisticated
entertainment, which sometimes achieves certain poetic intensity. But
above all, it is a product made conscientiously to try and entertain
big audiences, especially young people and adolescents. The plot, as
known, is fairly linear and predictable, we do not care so much what
will happen but how it will happen, and here the script writers have
put their greatest efforts. The film is enhanced by multiple
cinematographic, literary and historical references, although many of
them may seem obvious to an experienced film viewer. The film succeeds
at times to evoke the spirit of the novel Blood Meridian by Cormac
McCarthy, because of its obsession with open spaces, exploring long
distances and sometimes a true visionary power, trying to explore the
American dream of racial domination and expansion under a standard of a
relentless violence. Moreover, there are also references to other major
films, such as Dersu Uzala, by Kurosawa, in a key scene in which the
main character must share his helplessness with the Pawnee Indian. In
my opinion, the movie reaches its splendor during this part. There are
even references to ancient literary traditions, such as the Song of the
Cid, an epic poem of the Spanish Middle Ages (a clue scene almost at
the end of the movie). All told, the film, like all major Hollywood
productions, suffers from gigantism, exaggerations and unnecessary
cruelties of dramatic effects, and some implausibility. The characters
still tend to be quite credible, but the superlative performances
achieved disguise the little affection that writers have for their
characters.

In my opinion this movie its good but its not perfect. Its good for
obvious reasons, it has Leo DiCaprio on it, It has has Tom Hardy on it,
its directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and and it has scenes
surrounded by beautiful scenery and captured all in a spectacular lens
hold by no other than Emmanuel Lubezki which might just earn the movie
an Oscar for best cinematography although the competition its pretty
hard. I mean come on, Sicario and Mad Max had phenomenal
cinematography, well just have to see. Beside that and now talking
about Leo's performance I thought (for those of you who has already
watched the movie) that the real bear for Leonardo was Tom Hardy. I
thought that if Leonardo Dicaprio could make me want to see his scenes
even more that the ones with Hardy then DiCaprio could actually win an
Oscar for the first time. If Leonardo DiCaprio proves himself acting
better than Tom Hardy then he could actually do it, he could actually
win the Oscar. But I still doubt it. Hardy as expected for me acted so
superior compared to Leonardo and Im not saying Leonardo DiCaprio isn't
a good actor, i just think that when it comes to acting Leonardo
DiCaprio still can't escape or ovecome himself. At the end he can't
leave his trail and become something else, something different,
something new. Tom Hardy in the other hand its so versatile and can
actually leave no trail of himself when most needed. Proof of this is
Bronson, Dark Knight Rises and now this. A well deserved nomination at
best supporting actor. Now lets talk about the director. What happened
to Alejandro. For a minute I thought I was watching a Terrence Malick
movie not because of the narrative but because of the amazing
cinematogrphy used many time in his movies. Also at times i felt i was
seeing something from the Coen Brothers, Tarantino and even Arronofsky.
¿No more Multilinear Hyperlink Spatial Cinema? Anyway, if the story had
been a little more interesting maybe and just maybe i could've accept
that the movie wins the Oscar for best picture, but the story falls
short and ends up resting on the cinematography and the performances of
Tom Hardy and some of the performances by Leonardo DiCaprio (just some,
the bear scene for example). Well, this was my honest opinion. I hope
it helps somehow. Please excuse my English. Thank you very much.

I've heard tell of children in the urban West who don't know that milk
comes from cows. They've never seen a cow; they just can't see the
connection. I don't know if it's an (urban) myth, but it makes a point
about the increasingly urbanised nature of our lives. We're cut loose
from our roots and rhythms; we have established new ones in the urban
contexts, but we're no longer creatures of the earth and dust. The Revenant is a counterpoint to this, a film more in touch with the
nature of ... nature ... you could not expect to see. From Alejandro
González Iñárritu, the Oscar winning director of Birdman and staring
Leo DiCaprio, it tells the story of an 1820s American frontiersman left
for dead by his colleagues as he struggles to recover from a bear
mauling. It's a brutal, visceral tale of survival and, though this only
really comes to the fore in the film's final act, a quest for revenge. Many have said it's brutal - and it is. The Revenant's portrayal of the
natural world is of one red in tooth and claw; physical, weighty and
oppressive. There are very few concessions to CGI - apart from in the
bear attack itself, which is understandable, but doesn't detract from
the sequence's extraordinary impact. DiCaprio's character - and the
actor himself, presumably - really suffer here. Bones crack, joints
grind; winds sweep and howl; cold seeps into every crevice; food is
gleaned from the land and from dead animals. The cinematography is
nothing short of extraordinary; the cold colours gleam with a tangible
frozen bite; the takes are long and fluid, following the movie's
central character to emphasise that he's stalked as much by the forces
of the land as by his own mortality or people who would do him harm. There's a spirituality here. It's a spirituality of the Native American
cultures, one wedded deeply to the earth from which the people draw
their life. Tellingly the only reference to Western spirituality is a
ruined church being overrun by the elements; the only way DiCaprio's
character is going to survive his trial by snowbound fire is abandoning
everything he knows - including any semblance of familiar faith - and
embrace a mode of being that's at once hostile and essential for
survival.Contemporary Christianity has much to learn here. As our planet becomes
increasingly urbanised we lose our connection to the rhythms of the
pastoral life from which we have drawn our roots. That's not a bad
thing - nor a good thing - in itself. It necessitates a reinvention,
though; a rediscovery of theology, spirituality and worship that
connects to the way we live and is true to who we are and who we find
ourselves to be. Sections of the church are wrestling with this; but
some still run, crying about heresy or lost tradition. All the while,
people thirst for lack of vision.Back to the movie. DiCaprio - for me one of the most underrated actors
of his generation - is magnificent here. He's as physical here as he
was to very different ends in The Wolf Of Wall Street; long stretches
of this film pass wordless, his body and face speaking volumes. He can
be a remarkable actor, and his lack of major awards recognition
demonstrates how conservative awards judges like to be. They do like
their talent to suffer for their art, though, and that alone will
probably ensure trophies on this occasion. It's a good, remarkable film. It's not - I suspect - a great one. My
sense is that it will not translate so powerfully to the myriad smaller
screens on which films are now viewed post cinema release. I may be
wrong, but it feels as if the film relies so much for its power on
overwhelming you with the beauty and hardness of the environment that
the small screen will shrink it in more ways than one. In this era, a
great film needs to be great on screens big and small; I suppose we'll
all just have to watch it on our phones to answer that one. There are
other problems with this film - and the director's work in general. The
biggest of these is his treatment of women. Here the women are
off-stage, in memory, or a victim of violent rape. They have precious
few lines. In the context of a career thus far where his films largely
focus on the masculine in different expressions, this gives cause for
concern. The director has questions to answer, and they can't simply be
answered by saying that what he produces is very good in its own terms.
It is; but in the era he's working, he needs to do more with half the
human race.The Revenant is remarkable, thrilling, stimulating - and ultimately
hard to love. For all that's impressive and awe-inspiring about it (and
I use the word awe in its religious context), it's not going to lodge
in the heart; it fed my soul, but if I tried to live on it I'd be in
trouble.

Unlikely the complexity in his previous masterpiece Birdman, Iñárritu
has approached a straightforward story without much dialogues but
enriched with metaphors about vengeance and redemption. It is an
unresistant hypnotic drama that combines revenge, survival, violence
and desperation intensely that would certainly chill audiences both
physically and mentally. Each and every single detail of the film is
taken care perfectly, death and evilness of the characters are well
captured with beauty and horror thanks to the cinematography by
Emmanuel Lubezki, the setting of the stranded nature background and the
powerful orchestral scores add on the sombre effects which all
contribute to the impressive technical aspects of the cinematic
experience. Leonardo DiCaprio amazes again with his brutal and
anchoring performance struggling to survive while the commitment
between him and Tom Hardy into their respective roles have successfully
turned the director's artistic visions into an immersive life of death
journey. Although it seems to be a strange film with striking images of
blood soaking ground, animals and humans, it is an inspiring wild
expedition about humanity and inhumanity that is elegant in its own
simplicity.

From the unbelievable acting to the groundbreaking cinematography there
was not a single moment where I was not completely immersed in this
story. As soon as the opening credits began I was transported to that
cold wilderness and it was not until the final credits rolled that I
emerged from this film feeling as if I now understood what it may have
been like to love, live and struggle in a time when living meant
surviving.This film did an incredible job conveying the deep love a
father feels for his son. A fantastic thrilling experience that will
leave you feeling emotional. Dicaprio's portrayal of a character whose
overwhelming love for his son serves as the driving force throughout
this picture, was not only incredibly real and captivating but also
powerfully emotional. This movie is filled with a talented cast. The
young and veteran actors alike are like windows to another time,
transporting you to the difficult and gray existence of people at that
time. The breathtaking scenery of this perfectly filmed movie was like
taking a deep breath in a place you had never been. Living in the
Pacific Northwest all my life I felt the area of wilderness being
represented was so truthfully pictured. Every masterfully crafted frame
of this film will leave you speechless. It is a story that should be
told and a movie that should be experienced.

The Revenant is a great movie. It is definitely one of best theater
experiences of all time.Cinematography is absolutely breath-taking. There are so many beautiful
shots and it makes you think how did they do that. The movie is filmed
in natural light and it shows. The Revenant looks different than every
other movie. Cinematography is one of the best ever.Leonardo Dicaprio gives an excellent performance, even though he does
not have much dialogue. I hope he finally gets an Oscar for this
performance, but even if he does not get it we all know that he is one
of the best actors working today. Tom Hardy was also great in this
movie however his mumbling was bit annoying at times. And i really
liked Domhnall Gleeson's performance in this movie.Even though this is revenge movie, the main thing about this movie is
the main characters survival on the nature. He has lost everything in
life, but he just keeps going and going to the point he gets his
revenge. He had to eat raw-meat, he got mauled by bear and had to sleep
inside of a horse, but still he does not give up.All in all The Revenant is a beautiful movie. It has lot of violence
that even got woman next to me crying in the theater. Every scene in
the movie is near perfection. You should go see it if you are not too
sensitive.

The Revenant is an unusual movie in a way that makes you look at the
nature in awe and fear at the same time as sitting on the couch. Which
I think is hard to achieve. And Leonardo Di Caprio is an unlikely
character to appear in a western (remember the soft spoken guy in
"Titanic"). I had some doubts before, but he pulled it off. I very much
enjoyed his opponents acting too. This film contains just the right
amount of violence to make it believable. It's quite long too, without
becoming boring - another achievement.Action is subtle, yet compelling. As usual, I would've have liked to
have seen some characters survive, but yet they perished untimely.

Every scene of the movie was breathtaking and jaw drooping. The bear
attack scene is real that makes me wonder that how this was done. Not
one of the best acting performance but enough to make it an Oscar
winning performance. Excellent direction of the movie and the shots were just astonishing.Must watch movie in the Cinema. Alejandro González direction has made
the Movie a Masterpiece.If all films were shot similarly to how the Revenant is, then the movie
industry would drastically improve.the movie is definitely a must-see. Your money is well invested!

Mind boggling movie.What an experience to watch it on IMAX.I must say,
Oscar deserves Dicaprio this time.It would be incomplete without the
marvelous performance of Tom hardy.What caught me was the reality in
each and every scene.killing spree was though dreadful enough for any
faint hearted.That drum beats which showed the scenario in which that
fierce fighting was going was awesome.If you are interested in seeing
Dicaprio play such a splendid role along with hardy, you must go to
theater and watch it.In a nutshell,indeed,it was a treat to watch
Dicaprio playing such a difficult role one could imagine.The whole cast
and direction team nailed it.seriously.

"The Revenant" features the same successful formula of Alejandro
González Iñárritu's previous Oscar winning film "Birdman:" excellent
filmmaking from a very talented cast and crew. It heavily relies on its
visceral power, filmmaking technique, committed performances from its
actors, and the majestic beauty of its setting to overcome its
simplistic story."The Revenant" starts out strong with one of the most well shot and
immensely gripping scenes of the year in which Indians attack the fur
trappers. The scene was executed to perfection with stunning visuals,
gut wrenching intensity, graphic violence, and a realistic perspective
the audience experiences first hand through the use of a meticulously
engineered tracking shot. Then there was the intense bear mauling scene
which was also masterfully shot, though not as ambitious in scope as
the opening scene. Unfortunately for "The Revenant" its best scenes
were in the beginning of the film.As "The Revenant" dragged on it became sluggish, unfocused, and almost
inaudible. Although throughout the film it showed signs of life by
expertly depicting intense confrontations and beautiful scenery. But at
the same time, between the gripping and exciting moments, there were
many dull dream-like sequences that failed to give a clear
understanding of DiCaprio's Hugh Glass. For the long runtime, Hugh
Glass was not properly developed to feel the sufficient magnitude of
his suffering. Leonardo DiCaprio's engaging, and somatic performance
was enough to overshadow this flaw, and it may even land him his first
Oscar.Then there was Tom Hardy's menacing John Fitzgerald. Tom Hardy's
portrayal was good yet underwhelming for Oscar standards because it was
difficult to understand what exactly he was saying. Yet maybe this was
done on purpose for authenticity but it still made it hard to
understand his character and some vital plot explanations. Finally the
film felt so self-indulgent in its own style of natural light
filmmaking that it seemed like the filmmakers stretched shots and
sequences for too long just to show off their prowess.In conclusion, "The Revenant" is a well-acted, masterfully shot, slow
moving revenge/survival art house film with amazing scenery. The film
will definitely win Oscars for its filmmaking craft but falls short of
greatness because of its flaws. It may win best picture, but it is not
the best movie of the year. "The Revenant" did not fulfill its duties
as effectively and successfully as "Mad Max: Fury Road," "Star Wars:
The Force Awakens," or "The Hateful Eight" to reach 'best movie of the
year' status.

-The Revenant is a 2015 American frontier revenge film directed by
Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Written by Iñárritu and Mark L. Smith, based in
part on Michael Punke's The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge, the film is
inspired by the experiences of frontiersman and fur trapper Hugh Glass.
Set in 1823 Montana and South Dakota, the film stars Leonardo DiCaprio
as Glass, and co-stars Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, and Will Poulter. -The Revenant premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on
December 16, 2015, and had a limited release on December 25, 2015,
followed by a wide release on January 8, 2016. The film was well
received by critics who praised DiCaprio and Hardy's performances,
Iñárritu's direction, and Lubezki's cinematography. The Revenant won
three Golden Globe Awards, and has been nominated for 12 Academy
Awards, the most for the 2016 ceremony, including Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Actor (DiCaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (Hardy).--Critical response:-On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on
239 reviews and an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical
consensus reads, "As starkly beautiful as it is harshly uncompromising,
The Revenant uses Leonardo DiCaprio's committed performance as fuel for
an absorbing drama that offers punishing challenges  and rich
rewards." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 76
out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating "generally favorable
reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average
grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale. -Reviewers cited in a CBS News survey of critics praised DiCaprio for
his performance, referring to it as an "astonishing testament to his
commitment to a role" and as an "anchoring performance of ferocious 200
percent commitment." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called DiCaprio's
acting "a virtuoso performance, thrilling in its brute force and silent
eloquence." Writing for NY Magazine/Vulture, David Edelstein called the
film a "tour de force" and "(b)leak as hell but considerably more
beautiful," but noted the film had "traditional masculinity instead of
a search for what illuminates man's inhumanity to man." Justin Chang of
Variety wrote Iñárritu "increasingly succumbs to the air of grim
over-determination that has marred much of (his) past work" and it was
"an imposing vision...but also an inflated and emotionally stunted
one." -Stephanie Zacharek, writing for TIME magazine, gave a positive
review to the film stating: "Inarritu may have fashioned The Revenant
as the ultimate endurance test, but as Glass, DiCaprio simply endures.
He gives the movie a beating heart, offering it up, figuratively
speaking, alive and bloody on a platter. It -- he -- is the most
visceral effect in the movie: revenge served warm. Bon Appetit."--Accolades:-The Revenant has received numerous award nominations and wins,
including winning three Golden Globes, for Best Motion Picture  Drama,
Best Director, and Best Actor  Drama, as well as a nomination for Best
Original Score. On January 14, 2016, the film received 12 Academy Award
nominations, including the Best Picture and Best Director, as well as
Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, for DiCaprio and Hardy,
respectively.-Good Special Effects / Nice filmed / beautiful visual imaging / Good
imaging Pioneers (Trappers).

The Revenant is a very competent fusion of cinematographic technique
and artistic vision, whose stylistic attributes transcend a
simultaneously dense and empty screenplay. For some reason, the general
effect it leaves is lesser to the experience offered by the individual
scenes. Its narrative basis exclusively lies on the traditional ideals
of the western genre (self-sufficiency, honor, revenge and the
unavoidable challenge of natural forces, while they are paid the
respect they deserve). And sure, all that is spiced by wide doses of
pseudo-philosophy in order to prove that the main character's physical
torture has a cosmic meaning we can barely understand ("God is a
squirrel"). In summary: much ado about nothing. Having said that...
what a good ado. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu and the brilliant
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki repeated the amazing visual ballet of
Birdman, with the graceful camera floating without any difficulty over
complicated sequences in order to display the most dramatic details of
the action and the performances in a simultaneously casual and precise
way, sometimes with open shots which illustrate the geography of the
locations, and sometimes, with those eloquent extreme close-ups which
never feel confined. Unfortunately, what The Revenant couldn't preserve
from Birdman are the deliciously intricate screenplay and its rich
tapestry of character and emotion, which, after all, ended up being
more important than any tracking shot or invisible integration of
special effects. On the opposite, The Revenant is a simplistic linear
tale with unidimensional characters who suffer a lot... but express
little beyond of what is evident. Hugh Glass is the hero with a strong
volition and a very clear motivation; Fitzgerald is the devious,
treacherous and intolerant villain. And that's it. Two hours and a half
of a slow chase, extraordinarily shot but without a bigger dramatic
ambition. Sure, besides of the hero and the villain, we also have
another faction of persecutors to complicate things a bit and bring us
a lesson about the evilness of "white man"; but leaving that aside,
they don't have much relevance, at least until the screenplay needs
them as a predictable deus-ex-machina. On the positive side, Leonardo
DiCaprio and Tom Hardy received deserved recognition for their
excellent performances, and I would also like to mention Domhnall
Gleeson's unfairly ignored work, in which he credibly displays a good
range of emotions. This is undoubtedly a "style over substance" case,
but in spite of that, The Revenant was a very interesting experience,
and it definitely deserves to be watched on a big screen in order to
appreciate its technical triumphs better.

It's hard to evaluate a film where I liked a lot of aspects but still
it did not convince me in its entirety. It's not the first time a thing like that happens with Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu.Trying to perform an ''objective'' analysis I can say:1) The photography is simply amazing. 2) The direction is always a high
level one when it comes to Iñárritu. Here he does not propose a (fake)
global sequence-shot like in Birdman but he alternates masterful
long-takes with intense close-ups, confirming his great talent 3) The
editing is remarkable 4) The acting (which hardly ever interests me) is
excellent, especially the antagonist (Tom Hardy) works fine, so when
you have a good antagonist and a protagonist as DiCaprio (at his best)
the job can't help being good 5) The plot proposes many issues, all
meaningful (father-son relationship, racism, violated rights of Native
Americans, the struggle for survival, Nature, solidarity between ethnic
groups in conflict, revenge), perhaps too many to be condensed into a
two and a half hour film.I think what works the least is that Iñárritu's directing style does
not go hand in hand with the narration: they are not symbiotic and you
can perceive the dystonia.To give an example in order to understand you can think of Audioslave:
an extraordinary guitarist (Tom Morello) and a terrific singer (Chris
Cornell) have never really worked out as a group, never reaching the
level of RATM or Soundgarden anyway.It is therefore a missed masterpiece, but it works just fine at a movie
theatre

The Revenant was a movie I was highly anticipating due to Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu's last movie that won Best Picture Birdman. I was not
disappointed at all by this visual masterpiece. He brings back all of
the great shot composition and direction that we've come to expect, and
he really pushed all of the actors in the movie to their limits. While
watching you really felt like the actors were in serious pain. Although
this movie does have intense action and breathtaking visuals, it takes
its time progressing the story. It is not as fast paced as most movies
that come out in theaters nowadays. So when going into it don't expect
a fast paced revenge action film. It more acts as a drama and a fight
for survival that is truly moving. Leonardo DiCaprio brought everything
he possibly could to the table, and he did it beautifully. None of the
acting was melodramatic or sappy. Tom Hardy also gave a great
performance as the main antagonist. He really was perfect for his
character and he was handled very well. And anyone that reviews this
film and doesn't talk about the cinematography is a crazy person,
because it is a beautifully shot movie that really puts you inside the
environment. The Revenant is a film that stands as not just one of the
best films of 2015, but one of the nest made films ever. I highly
recommend this to anyone who wants a truly moving cinematic experience.

I am elated with this one.... Dicaprio rocks & hardy as well.DiCaprio is an extraordinary actor and a great film star. Indeed,
villain or hero, comedy or drama, DiCaprio has done it all. A few films
have faltered, such as "J. Edgar" and Ridley Scott's "Body of Lies,"
but eight of his last 13 movies have topped $100 million at the
Stateside box office. Leonardo can do it all when it comes to acting.
He has once again out done his self with this new movie. He is
rightfully due many awards this season. I am a movie buff of all types
of movies, give him his due! And lastly i wanna say....just go for it..

6 stars to this movie I give because scenario is little. Films focus on
the effort of Dicaprio to survive (who plays very well) Too long scenes
with no meaning, that is the reason that film is 150 min.If Dicaprio
wins an Oscar that will be for his effort to be honest. I read that
more of the scenes are real and took place in real conditions. The
truth is that we have seen him in better films. For one more time his
face is very expressive and that is why Leo is one of the best actors.
Now the for of the movie: I give 10 stars for photography with all of
my heart. Great photo shooting focusing on the magic of nature. Nature
is like a canvas.

A revengeful survivor story set in a terrific landscape.It's beautiful to look at from the word go but it's a painful to see
the protagonist coping with adversities and becoming a hero. It's a
story set in the 19th century so there are horses for commuting and
stones for making fire. Yet, the theme is universal and so it can be
considered a contemporary story with a couple of centuries old
backdrop. I went to see the film for two reasons, the director Alejandro Inarittu
and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and both seemed to in good form
although not in their prime form. Nevertheless, that's enough to make a
good film. Technically, the cinematography is top notch and the production design
is terrific. The whole crew has to be complimented for working a whole
film in such a drastic and unpredictable weather and landscape. The
editing could have been more precise. Too many frames of nature, I felt
and I hoped for more characters than nature. Makeup is amazing and I
suppose it's makeup and costume design is one of the finest I saw in
recent times. What disappointed me was the screenplay. This film seemed
a bit stretched out and predictability killed the fun. When you know,
the path and also the destiny, there is no fun anymore and this film
showed me both after few minutes into it.Leonardo has invested a lot of his time and his physical transformation
and fearless acting tells why he is one of the finest actors ever. I
got my money worth, solely by his performance. Though for me his
Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Departed are his best, this performance
stands tall too.Overall, it's a well-written film but 20 minutes short, this would be a
great film. As it is, it's fine for me.A 3/5 for a good film, but once again full marks to Leonardo DiCaprio.
Respect.

While this movie is shot beautifully and visually looks really good at
times with some amazing camera-work, almost everything else in it is
average.For those who are not familiar with the story, it's based on a real
life events. But, "based on real life events" is a bit strong word for
it. Movie itself is (loosely) based on a book from few years back that
is (very loosely) based on real adventures of Hugh Glass. And that
means that in reality, this movie is pure fiction inspired by his
multiple adventures slapped into one.While there were Fitz and Bridger and other people and there was a bear
attack at some point in Hugh's life, that's about as much as the movie
has any resemblance to the real life events. For more, just google Hugh
Glass and compare with the movie.This was not a critique of the movie for not sticking 100% to real
story, but I think it's important to note things like that and mention
them. It's a fun trivia to know for sure but you shouldn't weigh movie
quality by this. Also, if by some bad luck, you find yourself in
similar situation do not look back to this movie for guidance, watch
Les Stroud's Survivorman instead.Now, DiCaprio, Hardy, Poulter and Gleeson,they all give good
performances but by design, the don't have much room to do something
more with characters. Leo himself had some amazing and way better
performances recently than this. So ughing and aghing through mud and
snow and having painful face expressions can go only so far. And he
does that great, but that's about it, even with a lot of help from
great camera-work and direction. Character himself was written like
that, he did what he could with it and it's solid. Not Oscar worthy,
but solid. Same goes for the others.I can't say what could make this movie better, it just is what it is
and that's okay. Story was already changed to be more engaging than it
maybe was in real life. Characters are boosted up, there's revenge
boost as well and yet it's still somehow just an okay movie with only
thing that's exceptional is it's visual style and the way it was shot.
Without that it would be just an average 5/10 movie. So just for the
visuals, and some wilderness cruelty, you should probably watch this
movie.

Everybody loves this picture. They praise the looks of it. And indeed,
it looks beyond awesome. From a technical point of view, it is nothing
short of flawless. But unfortunately, beauty is only skin deep, and if
one manages to look past the the cinematography, he/she will find that
the story is nothing special, in fact, compared to the praise this
movie is receiving, it feels like it is a fraud. Basically it is the
journey of DiCaprios character from near death to a moment of revenge,
but if you take into account what his character goes trough, he should
be dead already from exposure or pneumonia half way trough, instead,
amongst other things, he rides a horse off a cliff and falls hundreds
of feet without getting a new scratch next to the scars made by a bear.
Also, the plenitude of nature shots which are there to pound in the
viewers the severity of the heroes situation, despite being beautiful,
are so excessive that a good one hour of the 156 minutes runtime of
this movie could have been cut out without any actual loss to the
story. The director is also pushing the boundaries with the flashbacks
and hallucination scenes just for the sake of back story and
motivational exposition. Given the depth (or lack there of) of the
story, the movie should have been around 90 minutes flat instead of an
almost 3 hour long epic. Honestly, when I was not bored by the national
geography shots, I was hating this movie with a passion. I found it to
be pretentious, hollow, with badly written characters and way too long
for its own good. Also, in about 2-3 years of time, nobody is going to
talk about this movie unless the topic is not the fact that DiCaprio
still did not received an Oscar yet. Quite frankly, I cannot imagine
anybody to want to re-watch this movie again given its length unless
he/she is glutton for punishment. I could go on and on about why I find
this movie to be soo bad, but it would become a mindless rant and I do
not like that. It is basically the posh version of Avatar. I am just
wondering when will people see this?

This was the most anticipated movie of the year for me, for several
reasons.Truth is it starts impressively, for almost half an hour, maybe
more, it stands as a unique cinematic experience, an immersion in an
almost savage stage, brilliantly directed, where the characters seem
more parts of the situation than people who are good or bad. On the
way, as the plot unravels, however, you get a feeling of repetition,
plus a tendency to leave a message(about the Indians and the white
invaders of their land), which comes a little unconvincing(Dancing with
the wolves was more convincing in such an attitude).Worst of all, the
plot left me indifferent.I didn't care at all about Di Caprio's
pursuit, and I even found Fitzerald(maybe because he was Hardy, but not
only for this reason) a more interesting character, and a more savage
one, but not at all the bad guy the movie finds at the end to be its
convenient scapegoat. Not a wise finale for such an ambitious film that
might have been the best Nature movie ever.But as the value of a film
lies not only in the production virtues, or even in the virtuosic
direction, but in its general attitude, the Revenant lacks, in my
opinion, the greatness of a Hertzog film(with whose films has a certain
affinity).In fact, after Birdman, I expected more from Inaritou.He has
evolved as a director(he is very impressive)from the times of 21 grams
and Babel, but he still has to avoid the simplicity of the supposed
messages he wishes to convey. Unfortunately, the Revenant turned to be,
for me, a dramatically uneven movie, and the pace was somehow lost in
the way.Yet, there is some greatness in part of it;maybe my ambivalence
clears out with a second look.

The Revenant is certainly a beautiful movie, worth seeing on the big
screen, but probably only once. It's entertaining, but not in a
repeatable way. I can't imagine people wanting to see this movie
multiple times because it's just so goddamn brutal and punishing.The movie opens with a gruesome and intense battle that rivals Saving
Private Ryan and its depiction of D-Day. And just when you think you're
safe to take a few swigs from your flask, our "hero" gets mauled (not
raped) by a female bear protecting her cubs. The scene is supposedly a
very accurate depiction of being mauled by a bear. That's nice, about
as nice as ordering an appetizer of four fried wontons and getting
five.The good captain inexplicably leaves our hero behind with the one man
who has consistently expressed his racist hatred for our hero's son,
and who has consistently expressed his belief that our hero should be
put out of his misery like a horse with a broken ankle.I was reminded of a few other movies: Jeremiah Johnson, with its
holy-hell vengeance; Antichrist, with its slow brutality in the woods;
Ravenous, for the lovely scenes of eating raw meat; and Papillion, for
its fabulist mythology.We get a lot of grunting and crawling, an occasional slice of the
supernatural, brutal amoral greed, and a search for tenderness in a
world that just doesn't give a damn. For anyone wondering why people
chose to live in the wilderness in such terrible conditions, just watch
The Revenant.

I had high hopes for this film given fuss about it and Leonardo's turn.
I was not impressed by either especially the film. The film is BORING
and if one enjoys seeing Leonardo grunting and crawling from one scene
to another than that is another matter. There was almost zero
development of the characters and much style and good cinematography to
hide this. Style and cinematography which we have seen before - think
True Grit, some Tarantino films The director tried to elevate it to
something spiritual at some point by superimposing some Indian chants,
wisdom over a flickering night sky and some goings on. It was so
derivative and predictable especially if one had seen the film
Gladiator, a much superior film which was truly about the journey of a
tortured soul physically, mentally and spiritually that managed to be
engaging on all fronts. This film tries hard to be that but fails. The
Revenant tried to be 'factual' and real (laughable) and showing the
horrors of hunt or be hunted by being in the midst of action without
being engaging. In doing this it impinges one of the worst horrors on
the viewer - Boredom.

There is a giant flaw in current major Hollywood productions; the
essential art of telling a good story.We desperately need writers who can produce strong screenplays with
plots that develop and hold our interest throughout a film. And we need
directors and editors who are able to seamlessly weave together a story
through film. We do not need a bunch of scenes tacked together and
called a movie.The Revenant being hailed as a great film is a travesty to movie-
making. It's a movie without a story, something far too common these
days in Hollywood.

Any Baldwin brother could have acted his part.DiCaprio's problem is that every time he opens his mouth it screams-
"Young Boy". He hasn't the physical or more importantly- vocal
requirements that would display him as a "Man", and that's where films
like this just don't work with him. He fits well into movies like
"Catch me if you can", but he is NO John Wayne or Clint Eastwood... or
even Alec Baldwin! and that's not good.For me? Standing up (or laying down) and making impressive looks on
your face isn't acting, really. Not the kind that should bring you
Oscar. Unless all the others last year were pretty lame.His role was pretty shallow and didn't offer much for him to show off
acting talents.The Film? was put together quite well. Very well. I am very picky about
reality though, simply walking through a stream and soaking your feet
in those conditions would have been a death sentence. There were
several other things that made me smirk, but there have been other
movies that take liberties with reality.John Fitzgerald acted better than DiCaprio. Either the other movies
actors were even more shallow, or he was given this award for some
other reason.The movie was good, would I buy it and add it to my collection? No.PS- Open note to Chris Rock... I am a white guy... does this review
make me racist?.... you idiot.

It has been over a month since I saw this film at the cinema... and I'm
certainly glad I had the chance to experience it on the big screen. The
visuals are so strikingly captivating that they stayed with me to this
day - I wouldn't have a problem with saying that this is some of the
best cinematography I've ever seen in film, especially if you take the
natural lighting into consideration. If you're anything like me and you
appreciate innovative camera work, you'll be amazed with the shots they
managed to capture in 'The Revenant'. But besides being a visual
marvel, does the film succeed in being a compelling tale like
Iñárritu's previous works?Well, yes, it does... to an extent. We follow Hugh Glass on a harrowing
journey as he fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left
for dead, and what we get is essentially a simple revenge story. This
is one of those films that absolutely excels in some parts, yet barely
delivers in others. After the amazing opening sequence and the
terrifying bear attack which was just simply masterful, the film felt
like it slowed down... and although I wasn't taken out of the story at
any point, I definitely felt that there were some pacing issues. It's
not by any means a "boring" film - as it crafts tension extremely well
and feels consistent with it throughout, but with the addition of
slightly pretentious dream sequences and a reliance on style over
substance (or in this case, beautiful imagery over narrative) the film
unfortunately starts to drag a little.In regards to DiCaprio's performance, it was great as usual, but was it
Oscar-worthy? This was a role that clearly relied on physicality rather
than emotion - which is what I felt the character was lacking where it
seemed necessary. If this performance wins Leo an Oscar it'll feel like
it happened purely because the Academy believes it owes him one.
Besides, Oscars don't define good acting, as many great actors have
never won an Oscar... but I digress. Tom Hardy pulled off a decent job
as usual, Domhnall Gleeson was absolutely fantastic despite his limited
amount of screen time, and I was pleasantly surprised by Will Poulter's
also small but memorable performance. All in all, I can't really
complain about the performances, and despite a lack of emotion on
DiCaprio's part, his energy and drive still kept me at the edge of my
seat.If I were to rate this film based purely on its visuals and
cinematography, I would give it a perfect 10 out of 10. However, due to
its flawed pacing and other minor negatives (such as out of sync
dialogue) I cannot give 'The Revenant' a perfect score. Iñárritu
decided to showcase physical brutality instead of emotional brutality
he incorporated in his previous films such as 'Biutiful' or 'Birdman' -
which I found to be more effective and far more emotionally powerful.
That being said, 'The Revenant' is still an incredible achievement in
filmmaking and provides one hell of a compelling journey. It is a
simultaneously mesmerising and suspenseful piece of cinema that not
only showcases breathtaking cinematography alongside a beautiful
soundtrack, but also displays the dedication of one of the best
directors working today.

PROS 1. The film is technically brilliant. There are numerous stunning, very
complex sequences that made me wonder how they pulled it off, with
ambitious use of cranes and jibs. Much of the camera-work is
mindblowing. There's a Native Indian attack on the hunting party near
the start that appears to be shot in one long take without any edits
and it's incredible to watch, Indians are shot and fall from trees,
arrows are shot through people's necks, people fall from horses, there
are knife-fights, gun-fights, and it's all shot in one long take that
goes on for ten minutes. Of course there ARE edits, but they are
cleverly masked, I think during the various whip pans. This sequence -
for it's ambition, scale and scope - is almost on a par with the
opening of Saving Private Ryan. The grizzly bear attack on DiCaprio is
technically amazing too. Incredibly realistic. 2. The Native Indians are portrayed in an interesting and fresh way.
They are shown to be intelligent, dynamic people. The performance by
the elderly Arikara chief is especially powerful. 3. There's an interesting interplay between the various ethnic groups
in this film. The French are portrayed as drunken, racist, corrupt
rapists. The American frontiersmen are a strange assortment of
Irish-American looking people with ginger hair, a few black people and
a cockney - similar to the type of demographic mixture you see on a
pirate ship, or the crew of an old sailing ship - or like the ship in
King Kong for example - it's almost the exact same demographic mixture
as those guys on the ship in King Kong, And Prometheus. And The Force
Awakens. And Spectre. I guess it's a demographic reflection of the
film's intended audience. CONS 1. The film becomes more contrived as it goes along. The film is about
DiCaprio overcoming one implausible challenge after another. He's
attacked by Indians - but survives, he's mauled by a grizzly bear for 5
minutes - but survives, the French find and hang from a tree DiCaprio's
Pawnee companion but fail to spot DiCaprio - who's camping in a big
tent just a few meters away. He falls over a cliff on his horse - but
survives (the horse dies), he's washed downriver in the rapids and is
heading towards a 300M drop but at the last moment inexplicably steers
himself into a tranquil off-shoot river and survives. He also nearly
freezes, starves and bleeds to death but always pulls-through at the
very last moment. DiCaprio faces death every 10 minutes yet survives
the most ludicrous injuries and accidents - meanwhile everyone around
him dies in a flash. 2. There are annoying and pretentious dream-sequences depicting
DiCaprio's Native Indian wife and son before they get killed. DiCaprio
experiences continual dream-sequences / flashbacks depicting his loving
wife watching over him from the afterworld which are impossible to
relate to because his wife and son are just ciphers who have very
little screen-time so we never get the opportunity to develop feelings
for them like we do for DiCaprio and to a lesser extent with some of
the other characters such as the friendly Pawnee Indian and the elderly
Arikara chief. 3. Much more could have been made of Native Indian mysticism. The
imagery in the film tried so hard to be mystical and profound but it
just came across as hackneyed and derivative. 4. Tom Hardy keeps letting people go - he's on the verge of killing
someone then he let's them go for no reason other than to allow the
story to continue. So he's got loads of witnesses to his crimes running
around the wilderness and he goes back to the fort where he can get
arrested and be testified against by the multiple witnesses he allowed
to go free. This is one of the more blatant flaws that ruins the film. 5. Tom Hardy is horribly miscast in this film - he's not menacing or
depraved enough for the role, he delivers his dialogue in a mumbling
Texan drawl that's barely understandable - you can't understand 95% of
what he says. His performance is comical, cartoonish and overacted. I
would have cast an actor 10-15 years older than Tom Hardy - Tom Hardy
is too similar in looks and demeanour to DiCaprio to provide an
engaging foil. 6. Bizarrely - whilst much care and attention has been paid to the
outstanding cinematography and direction (the blocking in some of the
long, complex one-take scenes is jaw-dropping) there appears to be
massive technical errors on the soundtrack. I noticed Tom Hardy's
dialogue was out of sync a couple of times. IN SUMMARY The director - Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu - pulls off massive
technical ambition perfectly, but maybe because of this, the film feels
artificial and contrived. As the movie progressed I started to get the
terrible feeling that I had seen it all before - and I had! He's copied
the story - I've seen this story so many times before: Badlands,
Deliverance, Southern Comfort, The Proposition, the recent film about
wolves with Liam Neeson - all remarkably similar in theme, tone. The
Proposition seared itself into my memory because it dared to be
different and dared to be new and it succeeded in doing that. These
qualities are missing in The Revenant, it's a rehash of a rehash.
There's no substance to it, and absolutely no soul. Everything is
pinned on the fancy camera-work and clever digital effects - but beyond
that - there's nothing there. I'm sorry to say this - but I can only
give The Revenant 3/10.

It is well played.. Leonardo Dicaprio does an awesome job as always!
This movie is very well directed. However, the plot is too boring.
There are so many interesting, wonderful stories about Native
Americans. Why such a boring story? It was too long. I wish the scenario was more interesting. For this kind of story I
expected more adventure since it is not a pure art film. The scenario
was so predictable and monotone.. There was nothing surprising in the
movie.. If Leonardo was not in the movie, I would never be able to
watch the complete movie..Maybe my expectation was so high..

Another Indian/Good - White man/Bad movie. Too long. Too draggy. Too
politically correct. Why was the Indian kid such a little bitch? Why
was he screaming like that? The bad bad white guy had a real point
there. The French were bad. The Angloes were bad. They drove off the
Spaniards, apparently. Good thing we can all turn to the noble savage
for instructions on clean, upright living. I thought it was really
pathetic that they had to mention how many hours went into the making
of the movie, like they're supposed to get kudos and awards based on
effort instead of outcome. After floating down a river a few times,
sleeping in a makeshift sweat lodge, sleeping in a horse carcass for no
real reason, writing graffiti in an pseudo-igloo, digging, climbing,
falling, cauterizing, baking, freezing, puking, crawling, the sob
probably died of tetanus. How long can you watch this sort of thing and
continue to be entertained? Three hours...nope. Oh, I know, this guy is
supposed to be just so sympathetic based on the fact that he's almost
an Indian that we're all riveted. Nope.

I left off reviewing this movie for some time. I wanted to mull over
what I had seen and come to an understanding of what it was that
bothered me about the film.See, I liked the movie as I watched it. At least, for the first thirty
minutes or so. However, once the revenge trail was well and truly set
out upon, things started to go downhill.At the end of that viewing, I was left in two minds as to how I felt
about the movie and that was why I decide to wait until I had time to
think things through before commenting on it.Now that I've had that time, here are my thoughts: Firstly, everything
about the movie screams quality. Quality acting, quality
cinematography, quality effects and so on. If I had to make a film, I'd
hire everyone involved in this one... with one exception.The writer. Hugh Glass' tale is one of revenge, albeit heavily altered
from the facts of the real Mr. Glass' exploits. So why then, did the
writers see the need to push the survival element so hard? Sure, the
tale of survival is astounding, but the heart of the movie is about
revenge. That is what drives Glass on in the movie to overcome all
obstacles placed in his way. Yet that revenge plays second fiddle to
the "man vs. the elements" story that appears here.What this means to the story is that there are altogether too many
scenes of narrow escapes and ridiculous survivability going on. In
fact, the movie is 90% this and little more.What's that? The real Glass survived similar travails? Well, yes he
did, in so much as no one story about him agrees on much of anything.
Yet this isn't a factual account. It is cinema, and in cinema, we
expect to be entertained. Incredible escapes are one thing, but when
they verge into the ridiculous, they have gone too far.Bear mauling...fine. Trek through hundreds of miles of frozen
wilderness... fine. Wading and swimming through icy rivers in the
winter and not getting hypothermia... wait, what? Riding a horse off a
cliff and surviving the eighty foot drop with no broken bones... hang
on a minute. Happening on a friendly native to help him... right.
Rescuing a native woman from the French... huh? It goes on and on. The
more you ponder it, the more ludicrous the whole thing becomes. Glass
in this film isn't just a tough survivor, he's indestructible. He makes
John McClane look like a pansy.Now, don't get me wrong, everything is done well enough to make you buy
the tale at first glance. But it doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
Everything is contrived. Actual survival elements are ignored when they
aren't convenient to the plot, such as the lack of hypothermia. In
other words, the more you think about it, the less coherent it is.I don't think I'll watch The Revenant a second time. It isn't that kind
of film. Unfortunately, it doesn't know what kind of film it wants to
be either. It's one of those films you will watch and then forget
within months. And when you catch it on regular TV in a few years time,
you'll frown, then recognise it, make that "Oh this thing!" face, and
promptly change the channel.A lot of praise has been heaped on it for its technical merits, and
rightly so. But story-wise, it is a mess. And, ultimately, shouldn't we
be watching movies for the story, not how well they are made? SUMMARY: Cinematic equivalent of "Don't judge a book by its cover"
Looks fantastic, but ultimately fails due to excess in the story
department - and not in a good way. Too much contrivance and
coincidence. Plays the "Look at me!" card too often. A tale of revenge
lost in the survival motif. Not as good as it thinks it is.

I love period pieces, I love films about the old west and those based
on historical events. I was expecting something spectacular based on
all the press, the trailers and reviews.What I watched was a boring remake of Man in the Wilderness. Yes it was
a beautiful location, yes it was amazing cinematography but that can
only take a viewer so far.Forget the moralistic mumbo-jumbo and the deeper meanings that the
writers and directors were trying to get across. One has to actually
care about the characters to try and find the deeper meanings. Di
Caprio's Glass doesn't give us any reason to root for the guy other
than a revenge motive and the entirety of his lines for the film were
grunts, groans and mumbles. At least Tom Hardy's Fitzgerald gave us a
reason to somewhat dislike the guy, although put into his situation,
his actions do make completely logical sense for those with a desire to
survive. The story moves at a pace that makes The English Patient seem quick
after the initial scenes. The CGI with the beasties is right there with
Sharknado. With regard to "mountain man" films, Jeremiah Johnson remains the king
of the hill. The Mountain Men with Brian Keith and Charlton Heston is a
fun diversion and Harris's Man in the Wilderness was very good. This
one, hmmm.Let me put it this way...I thought that perhaps Terrence Malick was the
man in charge as so much film time was spent focused on things that
were not doing anything but existing...trees, leaves, snow, rocks, the
moon. The story development regarding the main character is told in
choppy flashback and at the end one is left with more questions.So... disregard the trailers as they would indicate an action-packed,
historical man-versus-nature revenge film. What you will watch is an
Art House cinemagraphic snoozer of a film.

I don't know how this movie got 8.3 points, we left probably when the
movie was halfway. I must have had some willpower to stand it that
long. Many people in the theater were browsing their mobiles. They
proposed this one for Oscar? Someone is insane.If someone wanted us to know what pain is, he should know the Middle
Ages (this one too is in the Middle Ages) is full with pain, stupid
people and bloody stories.I think the Oscar should go to the bear in this movie, if insisting
with bringing the movie to Oscar.I watched today on Youtube some movies much better than this, so I'll
tell you this: try to find something better to do with your time.

When watching movies around Oscar season usually I find 2 types of
movies in my eyes. Those that are genuinely good and memorable or the
pretentious stuff. This seems to be neither in my eyes. I will say
there are good things about this movie but in my eyes, I didn't really
like it.The plot of this movie is about a bunch of hunters of which a majority
are murdered by Native Americans. After one is attacked and almost
killed by a bear, a couple of them decide to stay. However, when things
go wrong, one of them named Fitzgerald murders Leonardo DiCaprio's Half
Native American son and leaves him for dead and almost buries him
alive. DiCaprio somehow musters the strength needed to commit revenge
on Fitzgerald and slowly makes his way to where he is and commits his
revenge.My biggest problem with the movie is that about an hour of this movie
is simply Leonardo DiCaprio walking through the wilderness, regaining
his strength and all that. This might sound obvious based on that
paragraph but it's almost completely dialogue-free and what would seem
okay just gets very repetitive after a while. It was to the point at
the final confrontation when they were talking about things at the
beginning I had to wait a few seconds to remember what they were
talking about.Everything else just kind of hits the consistent note of it being
decent. I liked the cinematography, the actors are fine, the make-up of
the bear mauling at the beginning is really good. On a technical level,
I'd say this movie is somewhat of a marvel. The story however with the
hour or more of Leonardo trekking across the wilderness just makes the
whole story almost anything but investing in my eyes.So, I'd say if you want to watch it, be a little patient with the story
if you want to get out of the movie liking it. I have no idea of the
actual guy nor have I read the novel it was based on. Either way, I'd
say it is worth looking at even if it's simply for some of the
technical elements alone. Me however? I don't really like it.

Certainly this is a great movie, in which Leonardo DiCaprio makes a
really spectacular performance, and that has little dialogue.Despite this, I found a hard film that can easily hurt feelings, as
there are too many explicit scenes of fighting, beating, blood, wounds,
guts, deaths ...Sometimes I made me a little slow, but despite last more than two
hours, do nothing heavy, and continues with ease.The picture, however, I found spectacular, which is why I give it a
five.I missed that I introduced at the beginning of the film in place and
time, and they do not tell you in any way, and I think it's easy to let
them know the viewer through a simple sign.In short: good movie, but for once.

An admirer of photography, a keen impassioned heart of the openness and
vast emptiness of mountains and forests, and also a lover of the
boldness of harsh winters will fall in love with this film.Cold, loneliness, endless winter, wild fauna and flora, breathtaking
landscapes and powerful wilderness will certainly captivate your heart
and they are the only elements that keep this film going with the
filmography of Iñárritu that completes the structural equation.Other than that the film is filled with unbelievable extremes of
survival, which these extremes are so extreme, that are not even close
to "impossible to happen", to a point which this becomes ridiculous and
hilarious, and why not say, offensive to the viewers intelligence.I cannot say, "don't watch this film", as it will be unfair and unjust.
But I will say watch it, admire the view if this is something that you
like to watch, but most certainly, do not expect to find a jewel as
many say they have found.

This is the story of Hugh Glass, or rather this is the story of the
Hollywood version of Hugh Glass. Glass never married a Pawnee Indian
and he most certainly never had a son which reduces the plot somewhat!
The cinematography is superb and the locations cold and unrelenting. Mr
De Caprio is required to look glum and cold and occasionally grunt with
pain. An Oscar winning performance it is not! One can only assume
Academy members were impressed with his ability to survive on such cold
locations? The revenge mission in the film is completely at odds with
the accepted version of events. Tom Hardy is the outstanding actor and
certainly deserves recognition. The scene where his character
Fitzgerald on hearing that Glass is returning decides to rob the
payroll safe and abscond with the money. Untrue. Fitzgerald had left
the fort weeks before the story of Glass become public knowledge. Glass
had to head south to find him. When he succeeded in finding Fitzgerald
he discovered that Fitzgerald was now employed by the U.S Cavalry and
was therefore a government official. Shooting him would have meant the
death penalty for Glass. He had hoped to call him out in a gunfight but
in the end relented, retrieved his rifle and headed north to carry on
trapping. A disappointing film. With the budget they have why not tell
the true story and cover the whole of the life of Hugh Glass?

The enormous hype for this movie sent me into the cinema with huge
expectations. However no more than 5 minutes into the movie I was
bored. The next 2 and a half hours were spent wishing I had gone to
watch paint dry instead. For some reason good film making has now been
confused with good cinematography. There is no doubt that this film is
beautiful but the excessive reliance on the landscape as an extra
character adds an unnecessary hour to the movie. Many scenes were
completely pointless and didn't add anything. Watching Leo set up a
camp and crawling through the snow for 2 hours is really not that
interesting. Iñárritu seemed to throw everything he knew about telling
a story out the window and instead relied on using the cast and crew's
suffering in the mountains to sell a movie rather than making a good
story. All in all this film is clearly successful because of the names
attached and not for being a good movie.

If what you would want to see in a movie is beautiful cinematography
hung in an Ansel Adams frame, this is the movie for you. If you want
gritty historical movie with ample gore, this is the movie for you. If
you want a realistic plot and realistic survival situations, you may
want to pick another movie. Some of the implausible survival situations
sucks you right out of the movie, willing suspension of disbelief
blown, while you try to get back into the movie. If this happened only
once, perhaps I could be more forgiving, but all I could think of was
DiCaprio jumping up and saying "it's just a flesh wound!" It got
comical and ridiculous. Be sure you can forgive many mistakes before
you go see the movie.

First off I like to say that all movies are fake and they all have some
sort of unrealism. This is not a superhero movie. Nor, is it a movie is
built around fictional events. This movie is based on reality in this
world. The movie started out great! It was violent and bloody. Then,
Leo gets attacked by a Grizzly bear. It charges him and actually
attacks him twice. There is no way a person could of survived this!
Yes, people survive bear attacks. Only because they had other people in
the vicinity to help them afterward. Also, most who survive are missing
limbs and have broken bones afterward. A Grizzly bear's claws are razor
sharp. A female weights up to 800 pounds. The Bear jumps on Leo's back.
That would break it! It steps on Leo's Head. That would of cracked it.
Read bear attacks. After seeing that scene I just walked out! It might
of gotten better, but I wouldn't know cause I wouldn't watch the MF.
How can you finish a movie when the beginning is based on total B.S?
Yeah, get him attacked by a bear, but make somewhat believable!
SERIOUSLY?!

Late 2015 has given us two fine epics of survival, "The Revenant" and
"In the Heart of the Sea", both dealing with men who somehow manage to
survive against the odds after a disaster which leaves them isolated in
a hostile environment. The word "revenant" literally means "one who
comes back", and is often used to refer to a ghost which "comes back"
to haunt the living. "The Revenant", however, is not a tale of the
supernatural. It is a Western based upon the true story of Hugh Glass,
an early 19th century frontiersman. In 1823 Glass was part of a fur
trapping party when he was attacked and severely injured by a grizzly
bear. Glass's companions left him to die in what was then unexplored
wilderness, but he somehow survived and came seeking revenge on those
who had abandoned him. In particular he wanted vengeance against one
John Fitzgerald who had not only tried to persuade the others to kill
Glass outright but had also murdered Glass's son Hawk, who had been
trying to protect his father. In this sense Glass is a living
"revenant", one who comes back to haunt his enemies during his
lifetime. The date at which the film is set is an unusual one; most Westerns are
set during the period 1865-1890, the quarter-century immediately
following the Civil War, and it is unusual to find one set as early as
the 1820s. The story, however, is not particularly original; revenge
has long been a standard theme of Westerns. Indeed, Glass's story has
already been told in an earlier film, "Man in the Wilderness", made in
1971 and starring Richard Harris.I have never seen "Man in the Wilderness" so cannot say how it compares
to "The Revenant". Alejandro G. Iñárritu's film, however, is very
different from most revenge Westerns, not in its storyline but in its
style of storytelling. The traditional revenge western is fast-paced,
moving quickly to the climactic final shoot-out between hero and
villain. (Another 1971 film, "Hannie Caulder", is a good example,
except that there the person seeking revenge is a woman rather than a
man). "The Revenant" is different. It is a large-scale epic of the
West, slower and more deliberate in its pacing. It starts not with the
bear attack, as many directors would have done, but with a battle
between the trappers and a band of Native Americans. For most of the
film the emphasis is not on vengeance but on Glass's struggle to
survive not only the bear but also cold, hunger, hostile Indians and an
equally hostile group of rival French (presumably French Canadian)
trappers.Leonardo DiCaprio has not only given a number of fine performances in
recent years, he has done so while playing roles generally very
different from one another. The rugged backwoodsman Glass has little in
common with urbane millionaires like Jay Gatsby or Howard Hughes in
"The Aviator", or with J. Edgar Hoover or the youthful con-man Frank
Abagnale in "Catch Me If You Can". This is perhaps DiCaprio's most
physical (as opposed to verbal) performance; for most of the film Glass
has nobody to talk to, and even when he has he is not the most
talkative of individuals. His thoughts and emotions are mostly conveyed
through expressions, gestures, movements and a general sense of mood.
It was also a physically demanding role; DiCaprio had to undergo in
person many of the hardships which Glass endures, such as jumping into
icy rivers or sleeping in a buffalo carcass. His "Best Actor" Oscar
nomination is well deserved. Unfortunately, not all the acting is as
good. In particular Tom Hardy as the main villain Fitzgerald failed to
speak clearly and was often difficult to understand. He should have
stuck to writing "Tess of the d'Urbervilles". Iñárritu's original
choice for the role was Sean Penn, who may well have been better.A notable feature is cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's photography.
This is one of those films where every shot looks like a painting; I
was particularly reminded of the work of great American masters such as
Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Cole and Frederic Church. Most of the film was
shot in Canada, although because shooting overran into May the final
scenes actually had to be shot in the Andes of southern Argentina, one
of the few parts of the world where snow was to be found. This is not
simply photography of beautiful scenery for its own sake; indeed as
most of the action takes place in late autumn and winter the look of
the film is for the most part not conventionally beautiful. It is,
however, generally awe-inspiring; Lubezki and Iñárritu seem to have
wanted to create a sense of majestic grandeur in order to emphasise
man's insignificance in the face of nature and of nature's indifference
towards man, a sense which makes Glass's achievement in surviving all
the more impressive. I hope that the Academy will remember this film at
the Oscar ceremony. 8/10

It hasn't been far already into 2016 and there's already a fantastic
film that captivates your mind, body and even spirit to break or even
open further; and that film to be labelled as a 'Top Film' is The
Revenant.I won't go into much of the film's plot but I'll keep it brief;
inspired around the famous Hugh Glass (who has been labelled as
history's toughest survivor) it tells his deep and yet engaging
adventure that see's him fighting not only for himself but his quest
for justice when he is left for dead by an emotionless, careless and
even cowardly member of his crew.What makes The Revenant so amazing is that it's directed by both award
winning and critically acclaimed filmmaker Alejandro G Inarritu with
his style of storytelling, themes and character that make the silver
screen shine. There is so much to take away and grip from this so I'll
try to give my best of it all without spoiling it for you; firstly the
film's themes include 'Survival of the human spirit', 'revenge' 'God
and spirituality' and they help to keep the audience not only intrigued
to the plot but the way the characters are seen from our eyes.
Importantly, with Leo's character (Hugh Glass) we are shown that he's
not only a tough human but he's battling his own demons that push him
to be as strong yet broken in his path for revenge. Leo has played many
great roles in his acting career but I think that this role is his best
and truly toughest to play, it's bound to get him award nominations
again as like other years but this is indeed something that the Oscars
should deeply consider for him to receive. Tom Hardy is fantastic as
well; his character is truly a monster that is emotionless, heartless
and really driven for the audience to despise.Cinematography was outstanding throughout and the locations where the
film takes place are 100% real and really captures the realism of the
story's setting from wet forests, raging rivers, snowy mountains and
isolated trails. So much detail and thought has been put into this and
the efforts from both the cast and the crew behind the camera make it
seem so believably strong. Sound mixing and editing is strong too, with
sounds of birds, winds and even breathing that makes it sound so
beautiful but it's is composed soundtrack that makes it seem so
emotional and yet captivating, from Glass's visions to even seeing him
survive the harsh environment make these worthy candidates for Oscars
and further awards in technical achievement in film. Again, we see
camera shots that seem a 'one shot take' and even in one sequence we
switch from one character to another. The violence is brutal, bloody
and well executed and it can be confronting for some.Overall, The Renevant is a breathtaking, captivating, and brutal but
beautifully shot film that has so much to grasp but it will take an
open mind to get it's themes and character development. This is indeed
on my list (and the first entry) of best films for 2016.

I have to say that this movie was completely unoriginal and boring.
There was nothing new with this film, and it had an incredibly shallow
storyline. Don't get me wrong, the cinematography was gorgeous. That
being said, if I wanted to see beautiful cinematography with no
storyline I would watch Planet Earth, but in watching that I would also
learn something about the world. There is nothing to learn from this
film, and at the end of it you realize you never developed any
emotional connection to a single character.I have the utmost respect for Leonardo DiCaprio, and I truly believe
that he is one of the best actors of our time. As always, his
performance lives up to expectations. That being said, good acting
doesn't make a movie good, let alone great, and this movie wasn't even
good. If you want to watch a revenge film with virtually no storyline, but
with good acting and beautiful cinematography, then this is the film
for you. If you want to watch a film that is so original and exciting
that it draws you into another world then look elsewhere. I honestly
wanted to like this film, but it was so cliché that...well just see for
yourself. Go ahead and watch it, but don't have high expectations
because you'll be disappointed.

I have to say "The Revenant" was a breathtaking movie. The scenery is
beautiful, the direction is on point, the actors are doing a very good
job. However, I was personally expecting more from the movie, especially as
it had been acclaimed by the critics before its release. First of all,
it felt like the picture was unusefully long to tell the story Inarritu
wanted to tell (2h40). This resulted in a lot of lengthy and quite
uneventful bits. Secondly, while Leonardo DiCaprio does an outstanding
job (he is one of the best actors of his generation), I did not think
he was really given the room to perform to his usual standard at all.
Hugh Glass is an interesting character but I had the feeling the
character fell flat during the movie: his back-story is interesting but
wasn't exactly well developed in my opinion (the flashbacks weren't
always very clear). Glass has very few interactions with other
characters and it felt like the chemistry didn't work even between
Glass and Hawk or Glass and his wife. The only real connection he
seemed to have was with Fitzgerald but I can only assume it is because
Tom Hardy was doing a remarkable job. Thridly, this wasn't Leonardo's
best performance in my book. He is an outstanding actor, but it felt
Tom Hardy stole the show with his impression of Fitzgerald. In
comparison, the character of Glass was overall less charismatic and too
smooth and good to be believable. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I was expecting that little
"something special" that would make it one of the best pictures I had
ever seen and it didn't come.

All in all this isn't a bad movie however considering All those hype
around this movie, it was very disappointing. I'll start with good
parts: Acting department did its job very well. Both, leo and tom hardy
performed outstandingly well. I've read some reviews in which
criticizing the movie for too much violence and too much blood scenes.
In my opinion this scenes are acceptable since the deeper layer of the
movie is about human nature and harsh nature itself. Now the bad parts
of the movie starts with the main story or the one that is on the
surface and is very obvious: a cliché story of a revenge, battle
between the absolute bad and absolute good. a man who left to die rises
from tomb and gets his revenge. The thing that surprises me is the fact
that even the deeper layers of the movie which is about human nature,
nature itself and cruelty against first nations is also very cliché and
doesn't have anything new to present. The movie is too long and slow. I
guess more than 80% of the movie is an empty shot of nature or Leonardo
starring at some unknown spot. Now in Dead Man we see that Jim
Jarjmosch ( I chose this movie on purpose because it has a lot in
common with this movie) focuses on a solid story with accents of irony.
However in this movie Alejandro G. Iñárritu choses poetry in motion
pictures with accents of a story. I love poetry on motion picture In
the mood for love, apocalypse now, or many of Akira kursawa's movies
can fit in this category but if you fill 80% of your poem with the same
words it will make your audience get bored or fall asleep. At the end
of the day, I'm not there to listen to the poem, I'm there to see what
does your poem means.

I finished watching this film with mixed feelings. I loved its mood and
aesthetics and I cannot get it out of my mind. Yet I did not like the
film itself and I will explain why in the following. First of all, the most positively striking aspect of the film is its
cinematography. Emmanuel Lubezki's style is so extraordinary and
recognisable in other films as well, it is a whole different feeling to
watch. On one hand it increases identification with the characters but
it is also very smooth, flowing and takes you deeper into the action
without you even noticing it at first. My favourite example is the
vapour of breath on the camera. The other aspect I loved was sound,
including music. The score turns certain scenes that lack emotion in
image into a mood, a feeling itself, which is quite amazing as not many
composers achieve this aim. Also sometimes you can faintly hear a tone,
not a real melody and still that one tone causes extreme tension. Back
to the sound itself, it is very visual and authentic, meaning you could
watch many scenes, mostly the violent ones with your eyes shut and the
sound would just perfectly tell you what is happening.Whether that is a good thing or not is subjective. It may have been a
means to create realism but then again - sometimes sound or image, but
not both, is perfectly enough. Personally, I thought the violence in
The Revenant was downright disgusting and even though it depicts the
main character's suffering, it is just too much, too blatant, seemed
too meant for the effect of luridness. (SPOILER:) E.g. taking shelter
in a horse (!). I was probably just blind to that symbolism.SPOILERS AHEAD: As so many people are expecting DiCaprio to get an
Oscar for his performance in The Revenant, this being his fifth
nomination, I was paying attention to that as well. DiCaprio has a very
unlucky role here - it is at least the third time the character he is
playing is having visions of a tragically deceased wife (Shutter
Island, Inception, ...) - and the rest of the time his character,
Glass, is dying and/or suffering. While he portrays that
extraordinarily well, what I mean to say is, the character itself is
rather stoic, not one that is ambiguous. He is fighting for his life,
but where is the character development or dilemma etc?The mood of the film itself is fascinating, as said earlier, supported
by the score that is very faint at certain times and heavy in other
scenes. The film is a constant shift between contemplation and
violence, sometimes even intertwining. The probably most memorable
scene depicting this is the one in which Glass (delirious) is standing
in front of a devastated church, with its bell ringing from the wind; a
piece of Christian culture, slowly taken over by nature with trees
growing between the stones. There, he suddenly sees his deceased son
who is slowly approaching him and then hugs him. Glass cries and in the
next shot you see him hugging one of the trees. This scene enhances
such an aesthetically beautiful balance between life and death, culture
and nature, but also the tension of the setting, with the two cultures
fighting each other, one built on Christianity and art, the other
living in and with nature. The scene depicts grief and revives the
symbolism of the tree stretching throughout the entire film - all in
all, it had a very deep impact on me.At last, I am trying to figure out what this film is trying to tell me.
It depicts both mankind, both nature, in their ways; both can be very
cruel and very kind. My concern is something Fitzgerald utters near the
end - that Glass's journey, from the point he is left alone, is all
about revenge. He has nothing to lose or to go for but to avenge the
murder of his son. Yes, he does say in the end that it is not up to him
to take revenge, but up to God. He does change his mind about killing
Fitzgerald, as the Ree suddenly appear - a sign fate or God as Glass
interprets it. But that does not justify the fact that he had put his
own and the Captain's life at risk just to get revenge instead of
'putting it into God's hands' right from the start. Maybe this act of
not killing Fitzgerald but letting him be killed might be seen as the
character development I was so desperate to find, but it is still far
from satisfactory. Assuming Glass defeats death and keeps going in
order to seek revenge, this is a story of the weakness of man. There is
no message in that, except that we are weak and affective.In the end I was wondering if I might not simply be too young for this
film, just having started university. Studying philosophy and film I
would have expected to cope with it more easily, but found it very
disturbing and unsatisfactory instead. It gives no answers. Perhaps it
is not trying to, just telling a story. But then it would be telling a
2.5h tale of revenge and that, again, is not very full of meaning.

Starting with "Titanic" in 1997, I grew up watching Leo's movies. He is
a great actor; I hope no one denies that. This year marks his 6th Oscar
nomination for Best Actor. But to say that he should win an Oscar for
his portrayal of the bear-mauled hunter/fur trader Hugh Glass in "The
Revenant" is an overstatement. This is, after all, an award category for best acting, not for physical
suffering. I applaud Leo's dedication - freezing in the cold, eating
raw bison, sleeping inside an animal carcass - all of which was
difficult even to watch. Leo's lines were minimal due to the fact that
his character's throat got ripped open by the bear. His acting also
lacked depth; besides a very strong will to survive, I did not see
anything unforgettable.Nominated for Best Supporting Actor, Tom Hardy, on the other hand,
dominated the screen. Hardy's John Fitzgerald was not only believable
but also relatable. Hardy, down to his facial expressions, gave us a
flawed and vulnerable villain.I'm not discrediting the movie all together. The film, aesthetically
speaking, was very enjoyable. Director Alejandro Iñárritu insisted on
filming in natural light with simultaneous sound recording, and
production took 9 long months. I have to give major props to the entire
cast and crew for surviving such harsh conditions.I would rather Iñárritu win Best Director (but I'm really rooting for
George Miller on this one) than having Leo win Best Actor. I know I am
not of popular opinion this year. It was sad to watch him lose in 2015,
but I want him to win one day for the best performance of his career,
and this is not it.

Leonardo DiCaprio is Hugh Glass, the leader of a fur trapping
expedition in the 1820s. Glass's tale of survival after a mauling by a
grizzly bear and being abandoned by the two remaining members of his
party was told in Michael Punke's 2002 novel 'The Revenant: A novel of
revenge'. By the way, a revenant is one who returns, as if from the
dead  in case, like me, you didn't know the meaning of the word. The action takes place on the upper Missouri River in present day
Montana, North and South Dakota, with the original event bear attack
recorded as taking place in May. The snow, water, blizzards, snow melt
rivers, not to mention at least two Indian tribes and competitor
expeditions make it an incredibly challenging environment, and
underlines the unlikeliness of Glass's survival and 320 km journey to
Fort Kiowa. These conditions are most convincingly demonstrated, and it
must have been just awful for the cast and crew. Truly Mr DiCaprio
earned his fee!The settings are wonderful and the rivers, waterfalls, immense conifer
forests lovingly shot looking straight up through the mist, rain and
snow make you want to visit the areas  but at the height of summer.Initially the film is slow and I found it difficult to work out who was
who in the murky near dawn and dusk light. It is very violent, with
long detailed scenes that pull no punches, which makes for a gritty
experience that underpins the drama. In my opinion, it is too long
overall and the opportunities lie in the first half. As the film
progresses, the stunts become more and more amazing, making it
increasingly difficult to remain convinced of the veracity of the
story. But after a while, one realises that this doesn't matter and it
turns into a wild bucky ride to the certainty of resolution of the
moral dilemmas developed along the way.

Like the classic Western, The Revenant examines the thin line between
savagery and civilization, as played out in the white man's ambivalent
conquest of the native American. The central clash is between two white
survivors, Hugh Glass and John Fitzgerald. Both men have their proteges, son Hawk and cadet Bridger respectively.
Hawk soars but Bridger follows the wrong orders, imperilling his life
and soul. Glass bridges both cultures, having lived among the Pawnee, learned
their language and values, having lost a Pawnee wife and now caring for
and avenging the death of his son Hawk. Glass lives with the spirit of his slaughtered wife and in the last
shot appears to rejoin her in the spirit world. Indeed the title may
connote dreamer and avenger but it literally means a returning spirit.
As he says before his last mission, "I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd
done it already." Hawk says to the moribund Glass, then Glass says to
dead Hawk what he said to his dead wife: "I'm right here. You hear me?"
The spirits are there to address. This rebuts Fitzgerald's last remark:
"You came all this way just for your revenge, huh? Did you enjoy it,
Glass?... 'Cause there ain't nothing' gon' bring your boy back."Fitzgerald survived a scalping. When he meets his ultimate end it's not
directly at Glass's hand but by nature. The Pawnee consign him to the
rushing river. Fitzgerald is reduced to the material. He's greedy, murderous,
dishonourable in every way. He has no moral sense. In his theology God
is a squirrel you can shoot and eat. For Glass and the natives nature is a far larger spirit than an edible
squirrel. That's the point of the powerful images of the landscape,
Kananaskis (aka the suburbs of Calgary). God is in the land, either as
a harsh test or as an enabling spirit. When Glass pulls himself out of
the gutted horse he overnighted inside, he pats a respectful salute
before moving on. The central metaphor is what Glass learned from his wife: "As long as
you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe. Keep breathing.
When there is a storm. And you stand in front of a tree. If you look at
its branches, you swear it will fall. But if you watch the trunk, you
will see its stability." Time and again Glass saves himself or is saved
by deploying the twigs and trunks around him. When he rides off a cliff
a tall tree breaks his fall. In contrast, the French hang his Pawnee
friend from a tree, a summary if not an emblem of European
civilization. The Pawnee serve the nature the ostensibly "civilized"
exploit.Both the white and the native sides are mixed. Civilization is undercut
by the army's savagery when it eliminates Glass's adopted tribe. As
Glass warns his son, "They don't hear your voice! They just see the
color of your face. You understand? " Even the counselled silence won't
save Hawk. Glass as rumoured did kill an officer: "I just killed a man
who was trying to kill my son."Captain Andrew Henry is a man of honour and integrity, proved by his
confrontation of Fitzgerald. But his company shows a moral blind spot
when its workers end up owing the company for their expenses on a
thwarted hunt for pelts. There is also savagery among the natives, as the Sioux try to wipe out
the Pawnee. But the one native's pursuit of his daughter, abducted and
raped by the French, and the succour Glass gets from another isolated
Pawnee put them on the honourable side.As usual this historic drama is about the time it is made as well as
the time in which it is set. Star DiCaprio makes its pertinence clear
when he speaks out against the threat of the oil sands and pipelines to
the natural preserve and our continuing neglect of native rights.

Zero emotions! The critics about this movie are unlimited. My
expectations are so disappointing in all directions. This movie has no
meaning. Pity for Leo DI Caprio that did the best to support his role
and he really did it good but he cant make the story better. It looks
Inarritu wanted to show off with things that public never seen before.
It looks this famous director had nothing more to create and to attract
with meaningful things and he created such fake and cannibal stories to
look impressive and interesting. I would not let Inarritu in to
participate in Oscars 2016. Maybe he need some rest to do a better
movie and not to spend movie budget for his distracted and unfocused
fantasies. Anyway, Good Luck to Leo!

Was it wrong of me to laugh? I just couldn't help but see the
protagonist as the Wile E Coyote, with that same stupid wide-eyed look
of fear and pain on his face during every action scene. And without
giving anything away, one fight scene is Tom and Jerry / Itchy and
Scratchy at their finest. Even the fans of this movie surely won't be
able to deny that.Perhaps if I hadn't seen the exact same expressions on Leo's face in
the quaalude-fueled fight scene in The Wolf Of Wall Street, I wouldn't
have been prompted to laugh so hard. Mind you, it was the same dumb
expressions he had in The Aviator that preceded it, and I laughed then
too, also inappropriately, I later discovered. And if you weren't
playing for thigh-slapping laughs, Alejandro, why did you have the bear
roll down the gully and land on top of him? Comedic genius.I may have even felt bad for laughing if I had some compassion for
Glass. But when he's making every misfortune to befall him just so damn
hilarious, it's hard to see him in any real threat or pain. Being a
monosyllabic ape didn't help either.In about 24 hours, this movie, its director and its star will win
Academy Awards. Which will achieve exactly what the sole intention was
from the moment it was conceived. Just as well, because it certainly
wasn't entertainment. Although to be fair, I think there's a whole
subculture about to pop up of devising 'secret soundtracks' for this
movie, where you turn the sound down and replace it with something else
instead. Those in the know are surely trawling the Loony Tunes archives
as I write.

I had really high expectations for this movie. I like Leo's movies and
he's a great actor, but somehow this movie just wasn't that good. No
idea why, but I couldn't help but feel like the crew wasn't 100 %
present while making this. Really impressive scenery and a few nice,
well executed scenes (the bear-scene was amazing!... That's about it. I
need to say that Tom Hardy was a big disappointment this time - he kept
mixing up his accents and was also a bit hard to hear properly, but
that's probably intentional. In a movie that is this big, the
accent-thing surprises and makes the whole thing seem unnecessary
amateurish. This movie really had the chance of being a true gem, but feels nothing
else than a rip-off. I would like to get my money and wasted time back
now, please.

3 for the cinematography. 1 for the film itself. A big boring yawn of
seen it all before. Basically 2 hours of dicaprio stumbling about in
the snow and sucking his dirty fingers.Tom Hardy, save from turning into Yosamite Sam toward the end with his
over the top western frontiersman drawl, is great as the baddie. But
the trailer shows all the best bits of the film. The bear attack is
brutal. The dead horse (nick the idea from Star Wars) is interesting.
But essentially its all the stuff that happens in-between that is the
killer. Boring. Pretty but boring. By the end you just do not care if
the the main character actually ploughs through his ordeal and gets his
much justified revenge or not. You just want the film to end.

Oh thank God it's over.Those were the words I uttered out loud when "DIRECTED BY ALEJANDRO G.
INARRITU" mercifully appeared on screen at the conclusion of this 2.5
hour test of human endurance - and I'm talking about the audience as
much as the fictional characters and real life crew. The Revenant is as
much an ordeal to sit through at times as it must have been to live. So
much of the film is "LOOK! ACTING!" and "LOOK! CINEMATOGRAPHY!" that
nothing is ever enjoyable. Of all the films I've ever seen, The
Revenant is the one I can say, 100%, that I will never watch again in
my life.Leonardo DiCaprio has done much better work than this. I never bought
his relationship with his son. Hugh Glass is a near-zombified character
that bears none of the energy of Billy Costigan, Jordan Belfort, Howard
Hughes, Arnie Grape or Frank Abagnale. DiCaprio groans and mutters
throughout the movie, sometimes spitting in the screen he's acting so
hard. That's just it - DiCaprio is acting, and he's acting really well
but he's not performing. I never bought him as a person for a moment.
Compare the grief displayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years a Slave to
the "grief" shown by DiCaprio here, and the soon to be Academy Award
winner comes up drastically short.Tom Hardy is completely incomprehensible half the time as Fitzgerald,
but gives a much better performance than DiCaprio does. His eyes seem
to pierce the audience when he tells a story, and unlike Glass, he
feels like a real person who might have existed. The film is infinitely
more interesting when the film is following Hardy, Will Poulter or
Domhnall Gleeson, the latter of whom gives a commanding performance as
the group's captain. The film's screenplay has its moments but for the most part there's not
a lot of dialogue and that which exists just services the story and
leaves the storytelling up to visuals. The cinematography is
impressive, especially the gimmick that Lubezki found to justify his
third Oscar in the use of natural light. There's some beautiful stuff
to look at in The Revenant, even if 2 hours and 36 minutes is an awful
lot to take in. At times I felt like I could have been watching The
Lord of the Rings. Then I wished I was watching The Lord of the Rings.Technically, the film is for the most part very impressive. The bad
visual effects stood out - fake CGI animals most notably. The bear was
impressive even if the elks were not. There was some horrendous dubbing
where Native American dialogue clearly does not match the movement of
lips. I don't really think characters breath steaming up the camera
creates any sense of authenticity. Costumes, production design and
sound design are excellent, but the film's biggest coup is to the
makeup artists who create some of the most gut-wrenching wounds I've
ever seen in film. The editing is competent but there is a good twenty
minutes of self-indulgent indigenous pretentiousness that could have
been shaved from the film. I would have enjoyed a basic revenge story
to the revenge story plus DiCaprio's stupid dream sequences.If Alejandro walks home with his fourth and fifth Oscars to put beside
the three he already has, I'll be incredibly disappointed in how
shallow Hollywood is. The best way I can describe watching The Revenant
is if I were judging a child's oral presentation where the child is so
obsessed with giving the best performance he can that he starts to
annoy me. By the end, I'm so overwhelmed with information and it has
been so long, I just want it to be over. I can't fail him because he's
done good work, but boy do I not want to reward him for it.

Probably the most pointless, if not stupidest, movie I have wasted time
on this year. All I saw was: the bear was ramming into, slapping, gnawing at Leo's
face, neck, body, hands and legs. At one time it was literally CHEWING
his hand and leg. However, in that freezing weather, without any
medication, proper care or food, after being choked and put through the
mental anguish of seeing his son killed right in front of his eyes, he
managed to make it all the way to his first meal. The rest of the movie was, like everyone said, nothing.I saw Leo was PLAYING PITIFUL to be considered for an Oscar! This is
PA.THE.TIC.

Truly, this was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. If you
enjoy watching hours of Leonardo DiCaprio rolling around in the mud,
you will love it. Otherwise, you will hate it.What was good about the movie? The cinematography. That's about it. It
was nice, but it was also boring. You'd be better off watching a screen
saver of professional photographs of a snow-covered landscape for 2
hours. It would be more exciting. The bear attack and the final fight
scene were the only remotely engaging parts of the entire film. They
were still way too over-the-top, graphic and intense purely for the
sake of it. And this is coming from someone who likes stylistic,
graphic violence. But it works better in a deliberately over-the-top
Quentin Tarantino film, not a movie that pretends to be "realistic"
like this one. (Which it's not; it literally steals scenes from "Star
Wars: The Empire Strikes Back" except it's a lot less plausible.)The CGI was also pretty bad. The bear was obviously fake; so were the
buffaloes. They also look like they could have come out of a Star Wars
film, specifically the CGI-heavy prequels. At least those movies, bad
as they were, were more entertaining than this pretentious steaming
pile. Tom Hardy's ridiculous accent grates on the nerves very quickly.
None of the characters are likable and we don't give a crap about any
of them. Leo is the protagonist, and he has no personality to speak of.
The story is the most clichéd and predictable story in cinematic
history, except told in the dullest and most plodding way imaginable.This movie was an epic disappointment, and anyone who says it's a
"masterpiece" or "epic" should be told that the Emperor has no clothes.
They probably said the same things about the equally unwatchable
"English Patient" back in 1996. People need to stop pretending to like
things because they're afraid they will look less "sophisticated" if
they don't. This movie is bad. Plain and simple. Just calling it as I
see it.

Great picture, good direction by Inarritu, and two giants in the lead
roles: Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy. But behind a formerly
perfection there in no heart in this movie. Beautiful nature, rocky
mountain, snow like in The Big Silence, but i can't live one real
emotions, neither during the famous bear scene: the bear is incredible
real, but so cold, as if Inarritu is more focused in achieving a
perfect fight instead of an emotional fight. For this reason i found
the movie a little boring due to it's long duration - 2 hours 36
minutes. My favorite scene is the final one (but i don't reveal what
happen). Now i'm curious to see "Man in the Wilderness" (1971), the
first movie about the adventure of Hugh Glass starring Richard Harris
and John Huston.

Please don't pay to watch this film, unless you like wasting your time
as well as your money. However it starts with much promise, the opening scene was incredible,
it has to be one of the most immersive spectacular opening scenes I've
watched since The Dark Knight. And the visual assault continues as they
evade their attackers. We are plunged into more spectacular scenery as
a small group of men try to escape the Indian attackers in a vast snowy
wilderness where only Leo knows his way around the mountainous land. Once they progress through the wild, Leo gets attacked by a grizzly
bear. This is one of the most important scenes in the film where Leo is
left in a critical condition and what a fantastic scene it is. So
realistic and intimate you can practically feel the power of the bear
from your seat. Once Leo is left for dead by Hardy, the film ends for me. Be prepared
for another couple hours of just snow, crawling and Leo surviving
almost certain death experiences. And to be honest, you'll be wishing
he had died so you could have left earlier. As for the dialogue, well
of what little dialogue there is, it mostly goes to Hardy who obviously
decided he's incapable of doing a Texan accent so decides to mumble his
way through his lines. Overall the film is character-less. The whole story is based around
Leo's quest to avenge his sons killer. Iñárritu is unsuccessful in
making us empathize with Leo. In my opinion, this is ultimately why the
film failed. It could have been an incredible film but Iñárritu failed
drastically in everything but the fantastic scenery. Leo will inevitably get his Oscar and for what, a performance which
solely contained him just crawling around surviving, Madness.

A 2.5 hour harrowing walk in the woods...........that is basically the
story.I realize that for the "pseudo intellectuals" who are all the black and
white film converts,the cinematography has merit, that is if you live
in a colorless world but I personally enjoy movies that have some
color. By watching the film you will learn some survival techniques but
really, is this what you want? There is walking and more walking with
some gore (the highlights) in a bleak environment. Kudos to DiCaprio to
have survived the filming in these conditions, but it wasn't deserving
of a Golden Globe and certainly will not be deserving of an Oscar,
although he will probably win it. The dialogue is non-existent, but
grimaces of the painful experience seem to be what the film underlines.
The film is way too long and quite boring. A DOWNER.

When I left the cinema I actually didn't know what to say about this
film. I was speechless but not because the film had blown me away but
because I wasn't sure what I'd just seen. The film is visually
stunning. I don't think I have ever seen such a beautiful movie. The
landscape, the scenery, everything was just perfect. However, that's
about all. The storyline isn't great and in parts is extremely slow.
Some scenes were just weird such as when Dicaprio's character sees his
departed wife/lover floating above him and then has a conversation with
her in a language we can't understand and there's no subtitles. Very
strange. Another failure is the lack of hatred towards Tom Hardy's
character. The whole film is about Leonardo Dicaprio's character
seeking him out for revenge after Tom Hardy kills his son. The lack of
hate means audiences don't really care enough if Dicaprio gets to have
his revenge or not. Leonardo Dicaprio acting is very good despite the
fact he hardly speaks, simply grunting most of the time. I think he'll
win the Oscar but it's certainly not his best film. The bear scene is
extremely well done and certainly is one of the best parts of the
movie. Overall, I was disappointed.

An absolute masterpiece of movie making.It wont be to everyone's tastes but its been a while since I watched a
film and came out of it thinking that was a masterpiece and is now in
my top 10 films of all time. Leonardo Dicaprio absolutely knows what
hes doing as everything he does, whether thats professionally or
personally just gets better and better and better. Although its not
much of a speaking role for him (especially in the middle part of the
film) it doesn't matter because of what he goes through in the movie.
It really is his fight for survival and how he is determined to get to
his destination is where his acting is just mind blowing when he is up
against nature and the elements. At the time of going to the cinema there were only late showings in
IMAX but I will definitely go and see it in the format for my second
viewing. An incredible piece of film making which actually makes you 'feel' like
you were there. A top notch cast as well with Domnhall Gleeson, again
like Dicaprio, just getting better in everything he does. Everyone
behind the scenes saying that this was without a doubt the most
difficult shoot they have ever done, but boy oh boy every bit of hard
work is up there on screen. Beautifully shot as well with some mind
blowing imagery and a perfect score for such a powerful film. As mentioned, it wont be to everyone's tastes, but if you appreciate
films like Dances With Wolves (another masterpiece) you will love this
film. Go see it and go see it on the biggest screen possible. This film
is what cinemas are there for.

Having a passion for both movies and the great outdoors it will be of
no surprise that I've been very excited about the release of The
Revenant for quite some time. In the hands of a talented Director and
arguably Hollywoods best acting talents on board what could possibly go
wrong?I can't overstate how disappointed I was with this movie, to all the
reviewers on here who give 9 or 10 star ratings i feel the need to say
that the Emperor really has got no clothes on.I agree that The Revenant is a visually stunning movie and if thats all
it takes to make great entertainment for 2 hours I suggest you save the
price of your cinema tickets and go enjoy your local woods or beauty
spot for free. Personally I believe that great cinematography, acting
and CGI are all irrelevant if the plot is second rate, and here in lies
my great problem with a movie that had a really incredible, albeit
rather embellished story to work with. If as some reviewers have written this is a story of mans resilience
against the harsh forces of nature, then why did the film makers feel
the need to discard some of the most interesting elements of Glass's
story pertaining to that. For instance how he used maggots to eat away
at his infections in order to avoid Gangrene or the raft he fashioned
to travel downstream without dying of hypothermia, a condition that
Decaprio,s character seemed strangely immune to. Instead they add a
rather laughable revenge plot that even Charles Bronson or Steven
Seagal would have considered too cliché. When will Hollywood learn that
killing the bad guy who killed your loved one, is not just a very
dissatisfying and predictable narrative its also downright insulting to
the intelligence of the viewing public. Lets not forget to add in the
clichéd ghostly appearances of his lost loves, people who had literally
zero character development, to complete the disappointment. The only
saving graces of this movie is the well paced and interesting opening
battle sequence and Tom Hardys performance, proving yet again that he
is among the very elite of acting talent. Its a great shame the script
writing didn't match his contribution.My advice to anyone considering going to see this movie, is to leave
after the first half hour, go straight home and watch Deliverance or
Into the Wild or even go look at some trees, it takes more resilience
than Hugh Glass himself showed in the wilderness to get to the end of
this film.

I have never seen Leonardo DiCaprio in any below-the-average movie so I
had high expectations watching it. What a shock! The most boring movie
I can remember having watched. How can it have 8,2 rating with so many
negative reviews? It should have been between 4,5 and 5,5 stars without
any doubts.How can people be excited about it? Seriously, I have never
written any reviews ever before all these years I have this account in
IMDb but l just couldn't stand it. I had to say it and warn others. It
was that disappointing.Boring plot, scenario inexistent, too much violence and that ridiculous
scene with the bear... all mixed with a direction the cherry on the top
of the cake. A direction that could even make someone who just got an
ecstasy pill to fall asleep after few minutes. Don't waste your money like most people say here.

So I, like most other reviewers, really enjoyed the amazing
cinematography in this movie as well as the incredible locations... for
that alone this movie deserves recognition and praise. I've never felt
so up close an personal in a movie before. For this I give the movie 2
points.The acting, at least the physical components of acting, was clearly
excellent. I give the movie an additional 2 points for acting -
especially by our two main characters.But,My mind just couldn't accept the situations that our hero Hugh Glass
survived in this movie depiction of a story with apparently true
elements. Survival under such conditions is simply not possible. My key
example would have to be complete immersion in a river with water
temperatures in the 32 to 40 degree (F) range for - what must have been
at the very least - 15 to 20 minutes and perhaps longer. In these water
temperatures, a person would have about 10 minutes before their
movements would be weak, uncoordinated and ineffective; certainly not
sufficient to drag ones self out of the water up a steep bank, collect
wood, and start a fire. And I'm just talking about the water immersion!
Moving from water at this temperature to winter air temperatures in the
20's or 30's, with everything you're wearing soaked, is not survivable.
I could highlight the completely unbelievable nature of most of the
situations experienced by Mr. Glass, but I think my point is made.I wanted to suspend belief, I wanted him to survive, but the situations
depicted in the film were just too extreme.So no additional points because of this, in my opinion, fatal flaw.As others have highlighted, the otherwise single track story line with
largely undeveloped back-story and lack of dialogue also earned no
additional points for my movie rating.I wish had those 2 and a bit hours and the $16.38 I used up to see the
movie back.

Before I saw this film today, I knew that The Revenant was nominated
for 12 Academy awards, so I had high expectations. Then yesterday I
started reading several reviews and I got surprised of how many reviews
were quite negative. They mentioned the same things like that: "The
movie is way too long for its own good. The movie is boring. The movie
is too slow. The movie lacks story and depth. The main character is
unrealistic and seems immortal. The movie contains too many repetitive
shots of trees and nature. The movie turns almost a parody."So when I saw this film today, I had lowered my expectations, but was
still really looking forward to seeing this film. To my big surprise, I
actually didn't agree with anything of the things mentioned above.
Surely it's not everyone's cup of tea because it's more of an art film
than a blockbuster giant that's appealing to everyone. To me The Revenant is: Beautiful - the most beautiful film I have ever
seen on the big screen. The scenery's and lightning are absolutely
incredible, and it feels so real like I'm right in there. I love the
pace and the calmness throughout the film. The story is quite simple
without weird twists and turns, BUT that's not needed because that's
not how this story goes! I love the simplicity combined with the
brutality, struggle and determination for survival and revenge, as well
as love. I really felt for the main character.I love Leonardo DiCaprio in this role. He is perfect and I love him in
more mature roles like this. Everyone credit Tom Hardy and yes he is
brilliant, as well as all the actors are actually. Everyone fit in so
well in their characters. But I would like to give an extra credit to
Leo who is definitely not outshined by Hardy. What an actor and what a
performance by DiCaprio. I was really touched and impressed by his
character as well as his performance. He deserves an Oscar that's for
sure. There is more to this film than just Leo crawling around grunting and
the Revenant is definitely not close to a parody as some people say it
is. I can't believe people saying these things. It's one of the best
movies I have seen and it's been a long time since I've been so touched
by a film. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's my cup of tea.

I watched Revenant mainly because of Tom Hardy. But Leo is a bonus. The
movie's intro is pretty good. The director managed to create scenes
that are surreal. All the plots are good up until Leo was attacked by
the bear and had his son killed by Fitzgerald.From then on, I already know how the movie would progress - that Leo
will heal, and get revenge in the end. So predictable. The frustrating
part is how they stretch the "Leo healing" part of the movie. It was
just way too long. So many unnecessary plots.The movie to me was entertaining, except the "healing Leo stretches"
that just makes me wanna FFWD the damn thing. So, since they make Tom
Hardy a bad guy, and the stretchy cliché ending, I give this movie a 5.
And that's generous.

Just seen it. I give it a six because of the cinematography, sound, and
acting. Otherwise, this is a 5 minute story that lasted 2 and 1/2 hours
or so. Pretty disappointed. I went to see an entertaining movie, not
hear snow melting, insects in the background and streams running. There is a sub-backstory that never really develops and you can't make
any connections to the main story when it's over. Originally I thought the bear scene was worth the price of admission.
After the next hour or so of minimal dialogue and constant scenery, I
re- thought about it. The bear scene is worth the price of a rental!I like realism, but found myself wanting them to "get on with it
already"! The main character's struggles lasted ENTIRELY too long. This
movie could have EASILY been about 90 minutes and just as good. WAIT to rent this. DO NOT go spend $10+ for the ticket and then $20 for
treats.

This is one of the l-o-n-g-e-s-t movies you will ever sit through. The
story runs out of gas long before (about an HOUR before) the credits
roll. Two and a half hours to tell a story that could have been told in
an hour. That was just one of the worst things about it.Leo gets mauled by a bear while his hunting party gets nearly wiped out
by hostile Indians. The remnant of those left alive try to haul him
back with them, but soon find that the terrain is impossible to
traverse carrying his litter, so he is left in the care of a couple
guys who leave him and claim that he was dead when they left him.But, before I get too far, let me say that Leo could have avoided a lot
of his mauling had he lain still and played dead after the bear's first
attack. Instead, when the she bear ambles back to her cubs, he starts
crawling to his rifle and takes a pot shot at her. So, on to mauling
number two. Duh.He spends the rest of the movie surviving disaster after disaster with
horrific wounds without succumbing to the elements. Totally
unbelievable.The dialog is utterly incomprehensible...everyone mumbles into their
beards...so if you catch even a few words, you're doing well.Long, boring and unbelievable...those three words sum up The Revenant.

The Revenant is directed by critically acclaimed and 3-time Academy
Award winning director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Leonardo
DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson & Will Poulter.Left for dead by members of his hunting team after being mauled by a
bear, and betrayed by his confidant John Fitzgerald, Hugh Glass sets
off on an incredible path to redemption. Journeying across a vicious
landscape and in great turmoil, Glass pushes his body and spirit to
breaking-point. With his experience travelling across Europe in his younger years,
Iñárritu has acquired a rather large and passionate mindset for visuals
and interestingly intricate locations in his filmmaking. With Birdman
blowing away movie-goers and critics alike in 2014 with its beautiful
camera work and long, steady shots, with superb acting all accompanied
by a smart screenplay; Iñárritu had to return with strength. And he
has. The Revenant is already gaining major attention from The Academy
with 12 Oscar nominations and 3 Golden Globe wins. If that doesn't
convince you, take it from me; this is how you make a movie about
survival. This is how directors should start shooting action sequences
and entire movies all together. Long and smooth shots which never cut
unnecessarily, settling you right into the world with no noticeable
jogs or jolts that could pull you out. You can see everything that's
going on around these characters. I'm sure there are filmmakers that
are already taking notes, given the success of both this and Birdman.
Not only is this Iñárritu's influence, but cinematographer Emmanuel
Lubezki has the eye for nature, and using what we've been given, to
ultimate effect. It's worth noting that everything; every word of
dialogue, every scene of violence, every shot of scenery, was shot in
natural light. Only once was an exception made, for a campfire scene.
Meaning each day of shooting had to be carefully planned ahead of time
to make sure that those vital hours of light were used. This is one of
many reasons I love Iñárittu's work. Maximum realism, results in an
immersive experience.The screenplay is significantly convincing, and although around 40% is
spoken in Native American languages, it manages to keep you connected
to what's happening on-screen. Iñárittu is one of the writers for this
movie, amongst Mark L. Smith and novelist Michael Punke, who wrote the
story this movie is loosely based on. I'd like to read the novel and
see how this adaption varies from the original story. The acting by all members of the cast were outstanding, but with 2
Academy Award nominations being tied to DiCaprio and Hardy, you'd be
wanting to know if they deserve it. My answer; Absolutely. Both are
neck and neck with each other throughout the movie, and fall into their
characters with extreme intensity. DiCaprio has stated that this was
the hardest performance of his entire career. With all the things he
had to learn and do to become Hugh Glass I'd say he should definitely
take the Oscar. Whether he does or doesn't, will not affect my views.
The same for Hardy. Impeccable skill is on show here, by everyone, it
would be a shame if it didn't win, but it's already gained huge amounts
of attention so that's fine by me.Music by Ryuichi Sakamoto & Carsten Nicolai is fabulously soft and
subtle, yet energetic and expeditious when it needs to be. It was used
as a part of the overall sound design for the movie, and was added with
the natural sounds, not slapped on after, so to speak. This is
something I think that filmmakers should also think about doing more
often, weaving the music through the visuals without singling out
anything until last minute. It really adds to the overall viewing
experience, and makes for a pleasant surprise.The visual and special effects were barely noticeable, which isn't a
bad thing. They look real, feel real, sound real. The bear scene is
brutal. And I mean brutal. If there's one thing I can say about this
film, it's that it's brutally violent and gory. Again, not a bad thing.
This helps with the realism and nature of this story. There's never a
distraction.My verdict; The Revenant is another masterpiece by Alejandro G.
Iñárritu and showcases the finest acting, and passion for filmmaking.
This is a definite must-see. "My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands."The Revenant, 9/10.

One goes to the movies, usually, to be entertained & escape reality...
This movie was so gory and graphic that it provided neither an escape
from reality nor entertainment. Some of the scenes are stomach turning.
The plot is predictable which makes the drawn out length of this
horrible movie completely pointless -- the story could've been told in
30 mins. (tops). The acting was pretty mediocre .... Not much acting to
be done aside from dragging oneself along on the ground and breathing
heavy through half the movie.I honestly couldn't see any reason for the high rating this movie has
on this site nor understand the whole Oscar "buzz" over it... Truly one
of the worst movies I've seen in a while.To sum up... Don't waste your time. Or if you choose to waste it, make
sure you're not eating while you watch... UGH!I'd give this long-winded bit of trash a negative rating if possible.

Boy, I had a difficult time watching this movie. It is just to much of
the same thing and the same emotion. Dicaprio had an easy time learning
his lines, because not many words came out of his mouth, a lot of
grunting instead that gets annoying quite quickly. There was a lot of
laughter amongst the audience, not because the movie is funny, but is
is at many times over the top and highly unlikely. Yes the nature is
beautiful but I'd rather watch an episode of BBC earth, that is a lot
more uplifting. Overall the movie was quite disappointing. I don't get
the praise at all. The script can be summarized in one page, and that
is not a good thing.

it's absolutely wasting for money and 2.5 hours from my life.. the film
is boring and one of the worst films in the history. the film starts
with a good battle for few minutes after that there is nothing to watch
until the bear attacked Leonardo DiCaprio. after this the rest is
absolutely wasting of time. after about 1 hour the attendance at the
cinema started to leave and my friends started to argue about it and 2
of them slept.the performance of Leonardo was amazing and the story too but it
doesn't worth more that 1 hour. the length of the film made it boring
and bad.All in all I am not recommending to watch this movie. it's better to
wast your time sleeping or doing nothing instead of watching this.

I was not sure to go and see a movie which everybody says that is
violent, but so many nomination, I said it might worth seeing. 1-
Acting and performances are really great. 2- Scenery of wilderness are
amazing. 3- Plot says that a white man who is a member of
missionary/frontier post who lived among the American Indigenous, and
has a son, fled with a group of hunters after the the clan massacred by
US army. He fled after his wife is killed, but why he did not end up
with the remaining clan, and joined a group of hunters? The hunters
were attacked by the "Indian" and every detail of killings pictured
well. 4- You do not feel any pain that the "Indian" went through. Some
of them killed by other tribes, beside being killed by white who some
are good people and some are bad people. You do not find any good
"Indian", or maybe I missed this part since the scene of violence were
so important to be portrayed. 4- Indians in this movies portrayed as ,
a) Prostitute, b) fighters who just kill. c) some you can feel pity
about them. Is there any story of them being human, that even a
missionary goes live with them? Is this part you left to be created by
your imagination? Why?

The Revenant. Way too long to the point of tedium. The indestructible
Leo deserves an Oscar for eating all that raw meat, but Tom Hardy blows
him off screen for acting ability. Savage, gory and beautiful scenery.
The opening sequences are fantastic and should be seen on as big a
screen as possible. The bear also stars in this 'based on true life'
story, with one memorable attack. Despite the CGI this is filmed in
such a way to make it believable and Leo grunts and groans throughout.
Well done to the make up artists, the special effects are stunning.
There is very little back story, but the characters interact well but
there are too many long, lingering shots.

The Revenant is, to say the least, a visually stunning journey of
survival, deception, and Fatherhood. Directed by Academy Award Winner
Alejandro G. Innarritu, the film follows Hugh Glass (played by Nominee
Leonard DiCaprio), who after a brutal encounter with a bear, is left
for dead by John Fitzgerald (played by nominee Tom Hardy), and depicts
the grueling reality of nature that Glass must endure, in order to
avenge both his son's death and his deception. Inarritu incorporates
many of the elements of his previous films, such as making the scenes
appear to be taken in one shot and telling different stories while
overlaying them, to make one main story, which are seen in films like
Birdman and Babel, and allows his direction to shine, in order to make
a beautiful film. DiCaprio gives a shocking performance, in the way
that he rarely speaks and if he does, it is in a different language,
proving that actions speak louder than words. Along with STUNNING
cinematography, The Revenant is a powerful film that is truly beautiful
and given the harsh conditions that the film was shot in, and the fact
that the only lighting used was all natural, makes this film on the
best of the year, 9 out of 10 stars.

The Revenent is the second film I've watched this year, and I must say,
what a great start! From the second the wide landscape footage of shimmering water appeared
into the cinema screen, I knew this movie was going to be
extraordinary. The cinematography is unbelievably beautiful, the actors
(Dicaprio, Hardy, etc.) played an insanely amazing performance, and the
directorial cuts were inexpressibly good. Wouldn't be surprised if
Iñárritu won director of the year another year round. While exploring the uncharted wilderness in the 1800s, legendary
frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a
brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass
must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved
family. Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the
wintry terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former
confidant who betrayed and abandoned him.One feature that brought this film to my liking was the sense of
realism. The film was so immersive that you connect with the characters
that most need help and you grind your teeth and clench your fists with
the characters that deserve the savage taste of revenge.When the snow falls and the blizzard resolutes the gloomy-like forest,
we all start to shiver. When the blood-thirsty tribes kill with the
most unlikely of weapons we squint our eyes and squeal in revolt.This film has it all. The love. The hate. The remorse. The repulse. The
pain. The revival. A great cinematic beginning of the brand new year of
2016. Enjoy it and don't miss out.

Star studded cast but the movie leaves too little to be desired. The
revenge was too little, too late. The film definitely not Oscar worthy.
The film begins with a 1823 quasi-military hunting party of trappers
and hunters hunting for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of the
Louisiana Purchase under the command of their Captain, Andrew Henry .
Hostility from the Native American Arikara Indians leads to an ambush
of the hunting party. Only about half of the hunters manage to escape
on one of their rafts, salvaging as much as they can while still under
fire from the attacking Arikara. Henry leads the escaping party,
knowing that they are still being pursued by the Pawnee. The party is
further slowed down when Hugh Glass , one of the experienced hunters,
stumbles on a mother grizzly bear and her cubs while he is separated
from the rest of the party.

Alejandro González Iñárritu is on an absolute roll. For what is
essentially the second year in a row, Iñárritu has put out arguably the
most ambitious and well-crafted film of the entire year. The Revenant
is art come to life in the form of a genre-bending survival/revenge
epic.First things first, I believe Leonardo DiCaprio has given the best
performance I have seen out of him. While there isn't the humor or
charm in his character that there was in The Wolf of Wall Street's
Jordan Belfort, DiCaprio manages to make a turn against type as
introverted bilingual woodsman Hugh Glass. While Leo has been known to
turn on the charisma with his previous characters, he gives a more
reserved performance in The Revenant and primarily uses physicality and
body language to inform the audience of his Hugh Glass' state of being.
It plays very well against the confrontational and loudmouthed
antagonist that is Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald.Speaking of which, Tom Hardy is magnificent here as well. There's been
a lot of talk about Hardy upstaging Leo in his own film, though I
wouldn't go as far as that. Hardy gives a magnificent performance as
Fitzgerald, but is given much more dialogue and traditional
characterization than Leo's Glass. Other supporting actors such as Will
Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson turn in terrific performances particularly
in the second half of the film.One of my favorite things about The Revenant is how it is shot.
Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki captures an impressive amount of
beauty and detail utilizing only natural lighting throughout the course
of the entire film. One of the best examples of this is the tracking
shot of the opening assault on the camp (in particular where it begins
to follow characters in combat). The Revenant might not be one of the
best-shot films of the year, but one of the best-shot films in the last
decade or so. Set to the backdrop of a haunting primal score by the
impressive trio of Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto, The National's
Bryce Dessner, and German electronic musician Alva Noto, The Revenant
is transformed into a feast for the eyes and ears.The narrative of The Revenant is fairly straightforward, though it is
delivered in the most interesting, raw, and violent ways possible. Much
like a favorite film of mine from 2013, Lone Survivor, every bit of
violence is felt because of how it is presented. Every gasp, cringe,
and wince from the audience is well earned because it isn't too
over-the-top and it isn't over-saturated like many action blockbusters
tend to be.I can't really think of too many negatives against The Revenant,
however I can say that this is not a film for everybody. It's a brutal
film that goes at a pretty slow pace, so those who were planning on
watching this because they thought it was Leo vs. Bear like the
trailers suggested, will probably be turned off. The Revenant is a film
that also utilizes silent techniques and forces the viewer to look
beyond what is being said. This works for some times and not for
others. Personally, I feel as though the surrealist dream sequences are
a bit unnecessary and break up the flow of what is essentially a fairly
realistic take on a survival/revenge story. Though, seeing how much
this film is able to do right, it is a rather small complaint that I
have there. Overall, The Revenant is a film that deserves your
attention. If you are not opposed to a more slow-paced style of
storytelling and enjoy survival movies, The Revenant will be able to
deliver in spades and then some.

The Movie starts watching a crew who get attacked by two different
groups of men. Both looking for the goods they was transporting. The
survivors of the attack run away into the woods. One man Hugh Glass,
the strongest guy, get attacked by a grizzly bear. The grizzly bear was
incredible, the whole fight was dramatic and I couldn't buy it, that
Glass would survive. Specially when the grizzly bear fall over Hugh
Glass. After one hour flashback watching, drama surviving watching,
waiting that something happens, and one victim later, Glass faced a
French speaking camp, where a young Native American get raped. He
decide to take a horse and save the girl. At mostly same time
Fitzgerald another man of the first attacked group, get back to
town/camp and report to an officer, that the whole crew members where
death, just him and a young boy, survived. The boy felt guilty about
Fitzgerald report, because he left Glass before alive back in the
woods, and did not know if the whole crew be death. The best part of
the movie was the last 32 minutes, after Glass get hunt by native
Americans and fall down the canyon, and survived. Because the captain
made to the town/cam and report to the office what happen to him and to
the other members, and under his coat he had Glass water bottle with
him. Immediately man get on their horses and start looking for Glass.
Well the rest is yours, have fun to watch the movie.

Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's "The Revenant" is a magnificent force of
pure cinematic talent. This is one of the greatest movies ever made,
and is the best of 2015. "The Revenant" stars Leonardo Dicaprio as Hugh
Glass, a fur-trapper in the 1820s who is brutally mauled by a bear and
is left for dead by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy is a gritty role),
causing Glass to seek revenge while trying to survive in the treachery
of the western wilderness. Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu strikes again
with amazing directing that organizes the look and feeling of the film
perfectly. Innaritu doesn't tell you a story, he puts you into it and
makes you connect with a film instead of view one. Cinematogrpaher
Emmauel Lubuzki (who deserves his third straight Oscar) crafts
beautiful shots of both his subjects and the natural setting the film
revolves in. It's an amazing work of art that Lubuzki makes, giving
"The Revenant" a beautiful visual appeal. "The Revenant" is all about
nature, more specifically man vs nature, man vs man and man vs self.
Hugh Glass encounters all three challenges and experiences nature in
many forms, nut just from nature in the wild, but human nature of all
types. We understand Glass's feelings through his eyes and through his
encounters with various native Americans (who are also enemies of the
fur trappers). With spectacular acting by Leo and Tom Hardy, "The
Revanant" delivers a magnificent artistic vision of survival and
conflict while engaging viewers in a cinematic experience like no other
that tests the questions of life.

Beautiful in a self-conscious way, but often tedious. Aside from
occasional moments of elevated humanity, it's mostly an overlong,
gruesome spectacle of cruelty, pain and anguish, which after a while
becomes almost comic in the unrelenting and extreme nature of the main
character's ordeals (and the implausibility of him surviving them).
Aside from a moment when DiCaprio's character gains insight into the
pointlessness of his behavior, this is an unexceptional survival and
revenge story gussied up by how-did-they-do-that? cinematography,
portentous music, and a performance that screams "Look what I went
through to get my Oscar!" I didn't believe any of it for a minute.

After being nominated for 12 Oscars I knew I had to watch the revenant
and it is a great film. The premise sees a man seek revenge after being
mauled by a bear and left for dead by his men. Leonardo di caprio is
one of the best actors around and he continues in this film, this is
probably his most physical performance ever and I really did feel sorry
for his character as he went through this emotional journey. Tom hardy
plays the villain in this film and he is great in this film being a
rugged bad guy who is truly menacing. Domnhall gleeson fresh off of his
appearance in star wars the force awakens is really good in this film
and delivered a good secondary character to root for. This is
definitely will poulters best role ever and he was really good in this
film. The story of the conflict between di caprio and hardy is really
good and easily the most interesting part of the film. However, there
is some bizarre secondary plot involving some aboriginal people that
just really doesn't fit in the film. The script had some decent
dramatic dialogue, but it does lack the depth of some other films that
holds it back. The style of this film is incredible, the action scenes
are crisp and smooth and the cinematography being beautiful. Also the
score totally encapsulates this films tone. Overall this is a great
film that deserves its plaudits.

When I've watched the trailer for the movie I was convinced it will be
great experience. However after watching it I have several remarks. The
length of the movie: it is just to long and predictable. For the half
of the movie Leonardo just crawls and limps. The way (and what) he
survives is incredible with great dramatic scenes. The story doesn't
get to me: main character suffers and yearns for revenge but I can not
identify with his feelings. Maybe the reason is the same, duration of
the movie. The revenge and ending: after a long and torturous struggle
for survival one would expect great comeback and revenge that would
made up for all that. But it the end Glass just does what is expected
leaving me with unsatisfied desire for something more to happen.

Leonardo DiCaprio was good enough to win an Oscar playing Howard Hughes
(from The Aviator), coked-up stock broker Jordan Belfort (from The Wolf
of Wall Street), and foreign gunrunner Danny Archer (from Blood
Diamond). The Academy felt otherwise. Now it seems he's the undeniable
favorite to win Best Actor for 2015's The Revenant (my latest review).
I call it a sympathy vote. Academy voters have been blackballing Leo
for over 20 years so I guess they're calling it truce and just handing
him the golden statuette. His performance in "Revenant" is a solid dose
physical acting (with few words) but I don't think it's his best work.
He claws, he moans, he bleeds, he aches, and ultimately he suffers. I
suppose that's good enough to take home the prize at this juncture.Anyway, DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a hunter venturing from wintry South
Dakota to Big Sky Montana (circa 1823). He gets mauled by a bear, his
son gets unjustly murdered by his party's frontiersman, and because of
his bloodied condition, he is mistakingly left for dead by his military
peers. Barely ambulant, Glass goes on a long journey to find the
vigilant who took his boy from him. Leo's character gets put through
the wringer as he gets shot at by arrows, goes down a waterfall in icy
temperatures, sleeps inside a gutless horse, and eats the raw carcasses
of slain bison. Chameleon Tom Hardy (brilliantly) plays Hugh's
antagonistic foe, Forrest Goodluck plays his native American son, and
Domhnall Gleeson (About Time, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) plays his
captain, Andrew Henry. In veracity, I took in The Revenant's mostly
brisk, 2 hour and 36 minute running time and was reminded of a more
foreseeable version of 2013's Snowpiercer. Granted, this is minus the
futuristic elements and train ride vibeology.Now if you haven't seen the trailer to The Revenant, I implore you that
it literally gives the whole movie away. Sacrilege! And if you go into
this winter release without hearing any early advance about it, you'll
still find things pretty darn predictable. No matter. Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu takes a straight ahead and straightforward revenge
thriller and injects it with his brilliant direction. He gives his main
lead a series of feverish dreams and hallucinatory flashbacks to stew
upon. He also combines the dirty, the violent, the bilious, and
undercuts "Revenant" with sights/sounds of swallowed up nature. You can
tell he uses his own style but hey, why not steal a little from his
buddies too. There's a small bit of Terrence Malick going on here
(stills of trees and animals) and residue courtesy of Alfonso Cuaron to
boot (camera near the actor's faces with long takes happening all
around them). And despite the film never sustaining the power of its
opening battle sequence (between a tribe called Arikara and Henry's
hunting party), you're still entertained while being drawn along with
Emmanuel Lubezki's brilliant cinematography plus a harrowing musical
score by three different composers (Bryce Dessner, Carsten Nicolai,
Ryuichi Sakamoto). Rating: 3 stars.

Really now, beside the landscape and the performance of Tom Hardy,
everything else was boring. I do not understand why and how this movie
was selected for so many Oscar nominations.The story is more than predictable, Caprio acting is limited as his
character has its limitation (I do not want to write spoilers), the
rest of the team, beside Tom Hardy which in my opinion was great, are
below average.I consider this movie the best candidate for Rotten Tomatoes, not at
all for the Oscar statue. Even if Caprio made some sacrifices in order
to perform (temperatures, eating, etc.), I do not consider that the
Oscar nominations should be awarded for such reasons.This movie was equal to boring time for me.

this movie was wonderful, i had high expectations for it and it didn't
disappoint me it lived to my high expectations.The Revenant could be just one more survival story, but Alejandro
Iñárritu directed a movie that can be described as a great cinematic
experience. I've really enjoyed its dark but beautiful atmosphere
created by director Alejandro Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel
Lubezki (both Oscar-winning). The soundtrack just emphasizes it
perfectly. Outside of some brutal scenes, the movie is visually superb
and will take you to the beautiful landscapes of the Far West. You
should be ready for some extreme scenes of violence, though.Some of the most incredible things about this film, is by far the
cinematography and the sound design/mixing. Visually this movie is a
masterpiece. I say this because i've never seen a movie with this style
of filming. It's unique and refreshing to watch, especially because
their is not a lot of innovation when it comes to unique style in
cinematography. The sweeping, continuous shots that go on and on are a
Emmanuel Lubezkis trademark and they work beautifully. The absence of
music for a lot of the movie and the sound of the falling snow, or the
wind rustling the trees, or water flowing down the river is absolutely
beautiful. For some of the scenes, even if you close your eyes and
listen, you get the sense of where this film takes place.

4/5 for cinematography, 1/5 for story.There are too many plot holes to list them individually, but in general
they follow the "looks- great-but-makes-no-sense" type flaw. It starts
with the attack on the camp by the local tribe. Leo and his son are a
little way off but run to the rescue, for some reason through water,
even though it's much slower and louder than running across the land to
the side of the stream. The attacking tribe seem to have no sense of
strategy and risk killing their own as much as the trappers. The
trappers for their part seem very slow to realise they need to hit the
deck when arrows start killing every other man. You get the idea about
the drama that follows, lots of scenes wading needlessly in freezing
water, which would have made them hypothermic, lots of sheltering under
sparse trees even though there are much thicker clumps of trees nearby,
lots of camp fires which would have alerted the hostile tribe to their
location, lots of things making no sense at all - it's like no one has
any survival instinct.On this point, two big plot holes really spoil the movie. Leo would
have definitely died of those bear wounds. No question. His back is
shredded, not to mention his throat, and he would have passed out from
blood loss. The freezing cold would then have finished him off. The
leader of the expedition trying to stitch him up just looks ridiculous.Second plot hole - why Tom Hardy, left to guard the near-death Leo,
does not just kill him as he is concerned he is a burden in a hostile
area. He seems to need to him to acquiesce, okay so he has some kind of
conscience, but then is interrupted by Leo's son, and kills him
instead. He then could just have tied up loose ends, killed Leo and
claimed to his returning companion the son ran off from grief, but no,
he leaves Leo alive, which he obviously needs to do otherwise there is
no rest of the film.It's too OTT to be described as grim and the cinematography is too
gorgeous for it to be boring, but in a way that's what underlines what
a really badly thought-through story it is.Missable if plot-holes bother you. Birdman was genius, if you haven't
seen it, watch that instead.

I don't write movie reviews very often so believe me, it has to be
something that really stands out to make me write at all.This could have been a great movie. It has great visual effects, great
acting, good story line, and more. However, the sounds were horrible.
This has to be the worst music I have ever heard in a movie. There were
times in the movie where the sounds were so annoying that I had to
cover my ears to be able to watch the movie. At one point the
screeching sounds where so ear piercing that I was just about to walk
out of the theater had it not changed. Other times I could barely
understand the actors talking because background sound was stepping
over their voices.The worst part about the background sounds and music was that it just
continued on and on throughout the movie. It just never seemed to stop!
What was supposed to be the natural sounds of the forest was also
extremely loud and out of balance. I don't know why the normal sounds
of nature were amplified so much but the ones in this movie were
certainly not natural.I don't see how anyone could give this a high rating. Maybe they
watched with their ears plugged. How it got so many nominations is
beyond me. Just goes to show that politics also has a hand in the
Oscars.

This is a tough one, I get it. Yes I already got that after 80 Minutes.
But then the movie continues to repeat "Hell, you've seen nothing yet",
but it stalls on the same barbarian level where Decaprios body has to
suffer ones more. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy Zombi-Flicks and
splatter movies and I love tough westerns, but the Revenant would have
been better if it wouldn't take itself so f***ing serious an Mr.
Inarritu would have cut this down to 115 minutes. Its just like the
doctor said in "The Marathon man": This dent is dead, there is no need
to torture it anymore, I have to drill a fresh one. The Revenant is
trying too much to stay at 110 % pain until the end, so that I felt
numb when it came to the final showdown. It has spectacular
cinematography and a brilliant Tom Hardy, but less would have been so
much more.

This was one of the first movies that I've gone to see in theaters in a
very long time. It is too bad that the experience left me dissatisfied.I am a natural skeptic, and I think that this skepticism is what kept
me from enjoying the movie. I can accept plot holes, inconsistencies,
and the hero escaping unending deathlike scenarios in your average over
the top action movie, but in a movie that was filmed in such a
realistic way and touted to be based on a true story, these types of
things really bother me.The beginning of the movie had me hooked. The quite stalk transitions
into one of the most epic battle scenes that I've ever seen. It was
truly awesome. The first hints of highly exaggerated drama, and where
the experience turned sour for me, came with the bear attack. This was
a scene that most people loved, but it was the first scene that tore me
out of the movie and into the realm of criticism.For starters, this movie is beautifully filmed, and adding CGI, even
animation this good, really took me out of the story. The bear mauling
also seemed highly exaggerated. There were literally minutes of the
bear tossing DiCaprio around and biting and shaking every inch of his
body. I'm sorry, but no one could survive something like that from an
animal that large. Even if he wasn't dead immediately every bone in his
body would have been broken and he would have been torn to shreds and
bled out in minutes.The seasons/landscape in the movie also seems highly inconsistent, or
maybe I just don't understand the geography/time-line that they were
traveling through, but they go from wooded forests with little to no
snow to frozen tundra with nothing around them, and then back and
forth, and I just did not understand where the different characters
were at any given moment.I love how this movie was filmed, but if you are going to go through
all of the hassle to get untouched nature scenes in real light and tell
a tale based on a true story, why not make sure that there aren't
glaring inconsistencies and truly unsurvivable moments for the
protagonist. Here are some more that I noticed: - Multiple gun shots
from muzzle loading rifles/pistols without reloading. In any other
movie this wouldn't bother me/I wouldn't notice, but really you only
have one shot before you have to spend 30-60 seconds reloading one of
those things. This kind of inaccuracy was really glaring to me.- DiCaprio ate raw meat, and dove into freezing water for his role in
this movie, but he couldn't start a fire with flint? It seemed fairly
obvious by the way the scene was filmed that the fire was started off
screen by someone else. I would think that a movie trying to
realistically portray the struggle to survive would at least try to
show how hard it would be to really start a fire with flint. If
DiCaprio was willing to undergo the other struggles of survival, why
wasn't he able/willing to learn to start a fire? - DiCaprio struggles
out of a freezing cold river and can barely move, cut, next scene he
has a roaring fire but there are barely any usable fire materials in
sight. How did he build a fire? - What is with Tom Hardy's accent? I
appreciate his dedication to the role, but where is this accent from? I
had a similar problem with his accent in Lawless. He is consistent with
it throughout the movie, but is it just a made up accent, or is it
based off of how some people talk/talked in real life? If it is I
certainly haven't heard it before.- DiCaprio's leg was severely broken and we never see it set. When/How
did his bones magically set themselves and heal? Especially since he
doesn't have a source of food throughout most of the movie.- When they find out DiCaprio is somewhere outside of the fort they
send a party of 20-30 people out to look for him, but when a guy steals
all of the money out of the fort safe they only send a party of two? -
Why all the scenes with the dead wife? He didn't even have a wife in
real life, and I don't think any of the scenes added anything of worth
to the movie.- Reading through other reviews it sounds like the story in the movie
isn't even close to the story in the book. I really hate when they say
based on a true story, but it doesn't even come close. What am I
supposed to believe? In the end I just choose to believe none of it,
which completely defeats the purpose of it being based on a true story
in the first place.Despite all of the things that I disliked about the movie, there were a
couple of redeeming scenes. In particular I enjoyed the beginning
battle scene, and I think it is something that everyone should see. I
also loved the primal scene, where two starving strangers are staring
each other down while eating the raw meat of a fresh kill. This scene
along with the following scene where they are catching snow out of the
sky in their mouths were two of my favorites.

In a land where hypothermia isn't a thing, where fire can be started
and maintained under any conditions and last all night long without
being tended to, where broken legs be damned, where plot lines are half
explained and loosely woven together, comes this epic tale of survival,
revenge, and camping out in the chest cavity of a horse THE REVENANT!
The performance by Tom Hardy and to a lesser degree Leo saved this
thing. Will Poulter was also good. A little suspension of disbelief is
fine, enjoyable even, but glossing over what it would actually take to
survive the conditions portrayed in this film is a bit much. It is
incredibly unlikely that anyone could survive Leo's ordeals, starting
with the bear attack. And can a brother get a date/place stamp every so
often? The characters seemed to go from the heart of the Rockies to the
high plains in a matter of hourson foot. The storyline with the Native
American chief guy looking for his daughter, and Leo's back story of
living and breeding with the Pawnee could have been fleshed out more,
there is something more there, but instead we got a sprinkling around
the edges and not much more. Not a terrible movie, but there is no need
to run out and see it.

It started off quite well, although a bit too violent for my tastes.
Promising characters, beautiful scenery, some action, some sharp
dialog.But half way through I'd thoroughly lost interest.Problem one: the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense. From what I've
read in other reviews, it seems this is because elements were added on
top of the story it was based on to make it more exciting/dramatic.Problem two: most of the characters aren't believable, making odd
decisions. They're neither likable nor interesting, so I don't care
what happens to them.Problem three: for a survival drama, it needs to be plausible that the
main character could actually survive. There are multiple moments where
he's clearly dead, superhuman will to live or not. It just makes it
silly. It would have been more plausible with a fantasy/sci-fi element
to help out, but that wouldn't be a survival drama, would it?It's a beautiful movie, although far too violent for my taste, and it's
a shame to waste that on such a terrible story.

Leo DiCaprio should've won an Oscar a long time ago. We all know that.
He was great in pretty much everything he was in. You can exclude
Titanic, but still he was great in it. We see movies that almost seem
like they were made for an Oscar. Julianne Moore was the last example.
Boring movie with exceptional performance. Here we have Leonardo
DiCaprio, who should've have 3 Oscars to his name at least in this god
awful boring movie! I was like Elaine from Seinfeld while she was
watching The English Patient: die already, just dieeee!!! Movie is not
awful like English Patient, but it's waaaaaay overrated. Boring, oh
dear lord was it boring! It didn't touch me at all, I couldn't care
less about the characters. Leo will win it, he was good in it, but I liked him better in other
movies simply because those movies were way better! Leo great, movie
bad.This director gave us awful, just awful pretentious piece of BS that
was Bridman. Now he gave us this. Bore fest.

Adventures and Westerns are not my favorite genres, but I went to see
it anyway cause I think Leo and Hardy are great actors. This movie is
okay and exactly how I thought it would be. There's nothing new and
surprising in it and I got a bit bored at some times. I've only seen it
once and I'm probably not going to watch it for a second time. I don't
think this movie is worthy of 12 Oscar nominees cause I've seen better
and more important movies in 2015. Leo plays his part okay, but only
just. Again I've seen better performances. The movie is okay and the
bear attack scene is the best scene in This movie. I can only give it 5
stars and I must admit that I don't really get all the fuzz about it.

I know Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and is extremely talented to
handle things at different level with full dedication. Having said
that, I don't want to watch him alone for hours without any dialogue
just to see how good he acts. I got extremely bored and irritated for
very slow pace of the movie. The first few minutes of movie tells how
the narration would be. Some say it is a novel way of screenplay but I
feel it is the worst movie I saw in recent times. Although the movie
had some great cinematography at various scenes, apart from what was
shown in the trailer it doesn't have much to offer. Hope Leonardo won't
win Oscar for this and come up with far better movie with his acting
brilliance.

total man vs wild show. not a good movie. total 2 hour 30 min. you can
skip 2 hour easily and sleep in this time. only interesting thing
DiCaprio tried his best to survive these tough(impossible) situations
for an Oscar.make up and acting was good. but this move lack depth. it tried to show
a past event but added lot of impossible and imaginary things. these
factors destroyed the simplicity of this movie. again, it's not worth
watching. better watch another movie in this time period.this will be a great episode of "remote survival" in national
geographic channel.

Absolute highlight was the pictures of beautiful landscapes. As for the film, i don't understand how anyone can be nominated for an
Oscar if they don't have a script. Crawling around on the floor should
not be enough for any award. I can only assume somebody noticed
DiCaprio should really have had an Oscar by now so decided to give him
one for this - speechless.Massive dose of Hollywood fantasy as surviving being killed by a hungry
bear, floating half an hour in freezing water and not being shot by one
of fifty Indians while shooting a self loading flintlock pistol back at
them just about sums up the film. No story, no words, no good. Save your money and your time and don't
believe the hype!

The plot is a routine revenge story. A guy gets mistreated. His son is
murdered. He overcomes obstacles and gets even. Yawn.A routine plot is turned into a ridiculous one by the small events
throughout. The movie opens with a bunch of hunters wading through the
Everglades, except that it is somewhere in the northern Rocky
Mountains. Or at least is supposed to be, though I don't know where one
would find Everglades-like water amongst the pine trees anywhere in the
Rockies (where I have done extensive backpacking). This fascination
with people wading or swimming in frigid mountain water in winter
pervades the movie, showing up again and again. I've waded in that
water. It is COLD. My wife used to call it "screaming cold." Yet in
this movie people flop into the water, get completely soaked, and then
just walk away as if nothing happened. In reality they would very
shortly freeze to death and become encased in ice. Floating down the
river while fully clothed, including being wrapped in a bear skin as in
one scene, would drown you in no time.The scene shifts back and forth between the Great Plains and the Rocky
Mountains. Start in the mountains, move to the plains, go back into the
mountains (why?), back to the plains.The acting is competent but nothing special. DeCaprio's acting mostly
consists of grunts because after the bear mauling he cannot talk right
until near the end of the movie. I can do that. Do I get an Oscar? Over
and over we are treated to interruptions of the action for scenes of
nature, especially views of the tops of trees from the bases of those
trees. Is that supposed to mean something? It interrupts the story for
no obvious reason.There are these Indians around, looking for our hero and his friends to
attack them. The Indians are "Rees," i.e., Arikaree or Arikara. The
problem is that those Indians lived in North Dakota, not in the Rocky
Mountains and certainly nowhere near the Yellowstone.This show is just another ho-hum Hollywood mangling of history. The
characters are uninteresting and flat. The acting does nothing to make
the characters more than that. The plot is predictable except where it
is so silly as to be hard to imagine. Overall the show is mildly
entertaining if you are bored and don't have anything else to occupy
your time.

This movie sounded familiar. So did a little research and surprise!
It's a knock-off from a movie from 1971. It's not an original story and
the original was much better. Check it out yourself.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067388/ MAN IN THE WILDERNESS 1971.Quoted from the movie: "In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers and Indian traders are
returning with their goods to civilization and are making a desperate
attempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide Zachary Bass is injured
in a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and leave him behind to die.
When he recovers instead, he swears revenge on them and tracks them and
their paranoiac expedition leader down. - Written by Alfred Jingle"

I cannot believe this move got awards. It is from 18th century and in
the middle of NOWHERE - in the snow mountains with horses.There is no chemistry or any attempt to do character-building, bonding
between father and son and the whole story makes NO sense. Except for
the bear attack (with poor graphics), there is nothing really worth
mentioning in this movie.If you want to watch it, be prepared for raw some content - eating raw
meat, animals, fish and swimming in snow water and WET throughout. Also
one person biting off another's ear and spitting out it.I watched this by mistake. I wasn't paying attention and thought it was
Allegiant that is not released yet. So I ended up wasting 2.6 hours of
my life that I can never get back.

I laughed out loud several times while watching "The Revenant," a
bloated, bigoted, pretentious, boring, gore-fest that begs to be
parodied. "The Revenant" is so over-the-top, so ham-handed, I never,
for one second, forgot that I was watching celebrated actor Leonardo
DiCaprio straining toward his inevitable Academy Award nomination. I never forgot that his nemesis was played by Tom Hardy, who was
struggling to avoid being pigeon-holed as a pretty boy with bee-stung
lips by playing an unrecognizable psycho villain. Director Alejandro
Inarritu's didactic hand was all over everything. Normally I'm very
squeamish and have to close my eyes during violent or gory scenes.
There's as much blood in "The Revenant" as in a Quentin Tarantino
movie. I didn't have to close my eyes once. In fact I laughed out loud
over and over. DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a real frontiersman (1780-1833). The movie
version of Glass was married to a Native American woman and had a son
by her. The real Hugh Glass was not. There is a skirmish between white
Americans and Indians in the Louisiana Purchase. The whites leave the
scene on foot. Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear. He is badly
wounded. The party's commander leaves Fitzgerald behind with Glass.
This makes no sense whatsoever. Fitzgerald has telegraphed that he is
an unhinged, hostile, and aggressive bully who has openly threatened
Glass. No sooner does the commander leave but Fitzgerald kills Glass'
son and leaves Glass in a shallow grave, even though he is still alive. Glass arises from his shallow grave and starts chasing Fitzgerald
across what looks like the Grand Tetons. In fact the film was shot in
Canada, the US, and Argentina. For many long stretches of the film it
feels as if the whole point of the exercise is a long slog to find the
most picturesque spot in which to bite off a live fish's head. Many
shots consist of nothing more than DiCaprio, in heavy "I've been
attacked by a grizzly" prosthetic makeup, staring into the camera,
which was probably an inch away from his face, grimacing and grunting.
If you don't like the sound of DiCaprio grunting, don't go see this
film. All this grimacing and grunting builds up to the inevitable
showdown between Glass and Fitzgerald. Cue the spurting blood. Little of this is plausible. Glass is frequently seen standing in or
walking through water and surrounded by snow and ice. Hypothermia would
surely kill any human who attempted any similar stunt. The grizzly bear
attack is plainly CGI. There is a much better grizzly bear attack in
the 2009 romantic comedy "Did You Hear About the Morgans?" That film
used a real bear, not computer-generated pixels."The Revenants"'s director, Alejandro Inarritu, was recently
interviewed on NPR. He whined about how very, very hard it is for him,
a Mexican, to live in the racist United States. He's a Hollywood
millionaire. He won multiple Academy Awards for "Birdman," a movie few
people saw and fewer people liked. Inarritu is very Caucasian in
appearance. But oh boo hoo he has to live in the horrible, racist
United States as a Mexican! Inarritu also whined about the evils of colonialism, which he hoped to
highlight in his movie. Because, you know, it's really a bad thing when
men hurt, punch, knife, shoot arrows and bullets into, rape and stab
others. But, it's a really wonderful thing when Inarritu makes a film
showing all these actions in gory, graphic detail, and makes a
bucket-load of money marketing those very violent images. Nothing like
sincerity and purity of artistic intention. "The Revenant" is overtly anti-Christian. Tom Hardy's psychopathic
Fitzgerald is the one kind of interesting character in the movie, He is
just about the only one who talks. DiCaprio mostly just grunts and
grimaces. Though the characters are slogging through the high Rockies,
Hardy has Fitzgerald speak in a British-actor-working-under-a-Mexican-
director's movie-version of a Southern accent. Southerners should sue
Hollywood  why are psychopathic bad guys so often Southern? Even in
the Grand Tetons? Anyway. Hardy speaks in this nearly indecipherable
faux Southern accent. He's a mean, weird, unmotivated, hostile villain.
He talks about God and Jesus constantly. The message is very clear. The
white man's God is evil. A character named "Toussaint" rapes an Indian woman. "Toussaint," of
course, means "all saints." I wonder what Inarritu thinks of what
Comanche used to do to white women captives. Google it. And don't blame
me if what you discover gives you nightmares. Glass gets through his travails through repeated visions of his Indian
wife, who was, of course, murdered by evil white men. In one vision,
Glass sees his son in a destroyed Christian church. There are paintings
of Mary and Jesus, distorted by decay. Trees grow in the church. Trees
are sacred, see. The church was just evil brought by the white man to
hurt the Indians. At a key moment in the film, a key character makes a profound decision
based on whispered Indian wisdom. Yes, not only are Native Americans spiritual and loving, they also know
how to use combs. In "The Revenant" the Native Americans have groomed
hair, while the whites all have stringy hair hanging in their eyes.
Frontiersman needed their eyes  certainly to aim their rifles  and
combs are easy to make. The unrealistic hair is just more evidence of
the director's heavy-handed strain that took me right out of the movie.

This film takes to long to reach the end, and when it does you have to
wonder if you really care that it did. It begins brilliantly. The
landscape is stunning and the attempt at conveying mayhem through a
style of cinematography akin to realism makes the action sequences real
spectacles. There is a breathless energy to the opening half hour. Its
just when the plot is established it simply begins to feel laboured and
predictable. The locations are visually stunning and it was this aspect
of the film that I found most engaging. Your enjoyment of the film
really depends on your capacity to be interested in the principle theme
which is revenge. Once the fuse has been lit for this eventual outcome
it just seems to go through the motions until this is finally realised.
Overall the film looks great it just takes to long to reveal to little.

thanks go ogle for translationit's been awhile since I had not had such a bad time at the movies.
this film is just bad. the story is not worth a rabbit fart ... I
thought being in a zombie movie by time. this age-old story of revenge
with which we drunk American film length ... the only guy for revenge
against the world, I've had enough, I can not. There I saw myself in
rather die hard. After they try to buy their virginity against the
genocide of the Indians that was perpetrated THEM and in no event
FRENCH (blankets from smallpox is not the sorry French), the rest was
largely the French tend to take Women on site, which was unthinkable
for basic Anglo-sax that does not take what he sees as an ape as a
wife. Add to this inconsistency, cold resistance and infections of the
supernatural character DiCaprio who has forgotten that he had died in
the icy water in Titanic + icing on the cake: a UNBEARABLE music ...
these camera movements m 'also regularly reminded that I was becoming a
slug ... I wanted to leave the room after the rape of Indian cursed by
the French in the woods, only my half who accompanied me stopped me.
This scene is ultimately the only one I loved. The French can unsheathe
below -15 ° and still be strong :)

First of all, if Di Caprio would get the Oscar with this movie, that
would be a real shock to me.The movie starts quite energetic and attracts the audience,
nevertheless when the story starts, it is too slow, quite boring and
non realistic. when I watched the movie, I have remembered the road
runner that never dies. You must watch the movie without conscious to
enjoy. Many scenes and actions are out of nature.Also it is too long, well one can suppose to see good panoramic scenes
nevertheless they are not included. I really spent my 3 hours for
almost nothing.Simply it was a sample of bad story telling and scene directing for me.

I was utterly disappointed with this movie. I couldn't imagine
Alejandro Inarritu making such a bad film. I had the impression he
wanted to win another Oscar and tried way to hard to put everything in
this movie what he thinks the academy wants. His movies seem to get
more and more some kind of strange spiritual parts that i cant relate
with. All other movies he made are at least good (Birdman ...) and two are
great (Babel and Amores Peros) but this one was plain bad in my
opinion. Birdman wasn't the best film last year but it was cool in its
strange way with some great dialogs and only few flaws. The Revenant is
just one big flaw ... he tried so hard to make the movie look realistic
but completely forgot to do the same with the screenplay. The story is
very simple and artificial it reminded me of bad TV shows. I think the
basis for the screenplay was "how do i get another Oscar" not "i have
this great story to tell". The overall acting is very good with Tom Hardy being great. However
Leonardo DiCaprio had better performances (Revolutionary Road) but
still plays at a high level like he always does. The movie is well made
and well acted but the story is just a big fail IMHO ... so big i can't
give any points for this one.

"The Revenant": Do you want to encompass that feeling of surviving some
of the most intense circumstances that could happen to a human being?
Well then, I give you "The Revenant"! I just saw two films about
survival; one was legitimately great and the other wasn't, this here is
hands down is the great one. Set back in the 1820s when a man, Hugh
Glass, is left for dead in the wilderness to fend off against wildlife,
ravaging natives and pillagers on his journey to seek vengeance against
John Fitzgerald; the person responsible for the wrongs that were dealt
to him. This was an obvious passion project for director Alejandro Inarritu,
the cinematography is some of the best that I've seen this year or even
in the last few years. I would even say that the camera work done in
this movie puts some parts of his last film, "Birdman", to shame. This
was really something to admire for the effort put into the technical
aspects alone. There were moments where I couldn't believe they
captured what they did on location with using all natural lighting
instead of studio enhancement, which was a giant risk that completely
paid off. And any times there was CGI implemented was flawless; all the
effects in this film were done with a lot of perfectionism because I
could never tell I was watching a film, I saw a man struggling for dear
life to make it out alive in a series of awful situations. So many
times I kept trying to figure out how they did what they did on the
screen, but immediately dropped it because I just wanted this guy to
stop getting attacked before I had a stroke from the stress.Leonardo DiCaprioman, if you don't finally get an Oscar for the
grueling process that you must have gone through for this then
something is clearly wrong going on there! He did a crazy good job in
this film, I won't say this is my favorite role of his, but out of all
his performances this is probably the hardest work he's done and it
definitely shows on screen. The whole time I was biting my nails hoping
that he lives, each and every time something goes south. I could have
probably used a bit more comradery between his character Glass and his
son, but as it is I thought it worked well for his character to not be
so easy to relax. Tom Hardy also does a good job as Fitzgerald; at this
point, I'm not fully sure as to where he is even from anymore. Within
the same year I've heard him have an Australian accent, two separate
British accents, and now a southern/Texas accent. He's always a joy to
watch and from the start, you just know that this dude is a bit messed
up in the head. When he goes into detail as to whyyou get it. It's
always interesting to see what Hardy does next and how adaptable of an
actor he can be with 5 different roles in a single year to come out,
all totally different going from one to the next. He can be the perfect
hero, or in this, the perfect villain. And the climax between DiCaprio
and Hardy is at least a heart attack and a half. There is no
choreography going on here, it is two men getting down and dirty to
kill the other. It is brutal to watch and I couldn't look away for a
second, just kept yelling out "OUCH"!Now if I have any gripes or criticisms about the film, I'd say that it
does drag slightly during the second act and probably could have been
cut down a tad. There were some gratuitous shots of trees a number of
times as well as some voice overs that could have probably been left
out. As it is though, this was still quite the ride. It will end up
probably in my top ten of the year, but there are still a number of
others that I still have to see first. If this plays near you then I
recommend seeing this if what I've said sounds like your cup of tea,
it's without a doubt worth the sit.

This film should have been edited down by forty minutes. We got the
message of man vs. man vs. nature very quickly. Nature is beautiful but
cruel, and man in his natural, lawless state is more cruel than that.
Sure, the photography is beautiful, and the actors are props, not much
different than the CG bear. The only character shown in closeup was
Glass/DiCaprio; all the others are blurry, bearded faces given sparse,
barely articulate dialogue. The Indian-language words are accompanied
by subtitles, but so should have been the words spoken in English. And
you could hardly write a spoiler, because there is a resolution to only
part of the main character's adventure.

This was a huge disappointment. An event happens in this film that is
completely unbelievable. It is a key component of the plot and it is
absolutely unrealistic. I became disengaged after this huge mistake.
Aside from that, this is a very basic boring film with a plot that has
been seen over and over again in film history. The cinematography was
excellent as was all of the acting, but that's not enough to make a
great film. If the plot is hackneyed, then great acting and camera work
can't save it. I was stunned by the music - in a bad way. Is challenging music dead?
The producers took a risk of having the audience barely understand most
of the dialogue, but they don't trust viewers with challenging music? What will people remember about this film? They will remember all of
the hype about how the crew filmed in freezing locations. Suffering
does not make a film good.

Like everyone who's following the awards season, I believed the hype
surrounding The Revenant. Therefore I was disappointed watching it,
especially trying to find anything award-worthy in Mr. DeCaprio's
performance. After all, his dialogue through most of the movie
consisted of grunts and whispers (a bear in your throat will do that)
and the breadth of emotion, other than the connection to his son, was
primarily grimaces of pain.The scenery and photography were great. How much of it is CGI one
cannot tell, though I did learn that locations had to be moved from
Canada to South America when the Canadian snow melted, so I suppose
there was some "real" ice and snow.Maybe I didn't pay enough attention, and a second or third viewing
would answer some of the questions: Where was the movie supposed to be
sited? Western US, or Canada? Who were the various friendly and hostile
natives? Who was running the trading post? But sitting through 2.5
hours again? No. Once Glass begins to recover, the denouement is
predictable and inevitable, but still an hour away....and who cares?

At some points in your life, frequently during an alcohol abetted
musing, you will reflect on expended time that you wish you could have
back. This movie is one of those times. Boring, pointless and banal, it
would have been a trial at 90 minutes. At two and a half hours, it's
stultifying. While the CGI and cinematography are impressive, the
dialog is creaky, the characters obvious and stereotypical. Even the
eventual (and merciful) ending was obvious about halfway through,
thanks primarily to the dream state reappearances of the film's
eponymous character.I don't pretend to know the criteria that Leonardo Dicaprio employs in
selecting certain scripts (like a "Great Gatsby" that F. Scott
Fitzgerald would never recognize) but he should have passed on this
one. I wish I had.

Yeah, a Hollywood actor can survive the mauling by a huge bear. Can
survive being buried half-dead in freezing temperatures. Can survive
alone and half dead and wounded in freezing temperatures without food
and weapons, swimming in freezing cold water, surviving in wet clothes
in freezing temperatures . Miraculously this Hollywood actor can
suddenly run when necessary while he limped just a second ago. Though
finally arriving at a safe spot still half dead , he is immediately
able to go out again and fight his enemy. Half of the movie I closed my
eyes because I had no desire to watch the gore fest, the beautiful
scenery with stolen Ansel Adams images did not make up for the rest. I
should have followed my initial instinct. After watching a preview I
thought that this was not a movie for me and I was right. Never again
will I fall for the hype. Unbelievable.. Disgusting blood orgy.

Pretending to be realistic, the Revenant bludgeons you with extreme,
extended close-ups of gore such as a horror film might do. In this case
the pretense of authenticity ("based on real-life events") begs us to
suspend our disbelief across too many literally incredible events. The
pretense is shredded by various happenings in the film, that go far
beyond the limits of reason. Having been badly mauled by the bear, near
death and not expected to live, having not eaten for days, our hero
lays out in the bitter cold all night without anything but the damp
clothing on his back. The hypothermia would have killed any healthy
person. Then in his diminished state he goes floating down a northern
river in the dead of winter, ice water really, for ten minutes, gets
out all wet and manages to survive. So far he would have been dead
three times. He evades a chase by a whole gang of Indians firing
bullets and arrows at him. Fourth death. He and horse run headlong off
an 80-foot cliff. A tree breaks his fall, and he's just fine. Fifth
death. It's not an amazing will to live. It's BS.The captain doesn't take a whole crew out with him in the middle of the
night in the dead of winter to hunt down the culprit--just the hobbled,
ill Glass. Why?This is "real life" events made into a comic book. The film asks us to
be gullible fools. It insults our intelligence. It wants to stimulate
us with intense violence, a cheap device used all too often in American
films. Why? Because it's easy. It works if you let it. You're like,
Wow. It speaks to the teenage boy in you. If you're not a teenage boy,
move on.Don't let the artistic veneer of the film seduce you into believing
it's great. It just uses the same cheap shots as all the films shown in
the trailers when I saw it last night--all with explosions, gunfight,
gore, occult, etc. Worse, the intense, extended violence in this film
could traumatize some. Beware.

Pros: Great scenery. A list actors (DiCaprio, Hardy, others). Did I
mention Great Scenery?Cons: Story ripped off from Man in the Wilderness. No plot other than a
man crawling through the snow for 2 hours. Unbelievable action
(floating down an icy cold river in winter without freezing or
hypothermia setting in). Starting fires without an effort in winter
with everything wet or covered with snow. No plot other than a man
crawling through the snow for 2 hours (did I already mention that?).
CGI bear. Boring, anti-climatic predictable ending (not worth the
wait). No emotional connection with the main character because there is
no character development. Lots and lots of snow. Sophomoric dialogue.
Cartoonish characters. Lots and lots of snow.To sum up in one word: Pretentious (look it up like I did)Will undoubtedly win lots and lots of Oscars...

First of all, know this is a guy movie. Blood, revenge, action. Over
and over again. And for you guys, you might get encouraged by that. But
I would warn against getting excited, because this film is essentially
a let down. Also be prepared for a politically correct lecture.There were rumours of DiCaprio getting an Oscar for this role. No
chance! Why? Because it hardly requires a wide dramatic range. The
whole film is one mood throughout i.e. depressing. Endless snow, cold,
greyness and savagery. And it actually gets a little tedious.I think we're meant to marvel at how DiCaprio survives onslaught after
onslaught. But it becomes a parody. A bear attack, falling off a cliff,
starving, almost drowning. The list goes on. And yet DiCaprio just
keeps on going like a Duracell rabbit. They overdid it basically.I wanted to enjoy this film. And Tom Hardy's predictably convincing
part almost saved it. But there's only so much torture, pain and snow I
can take. Add to that the politically correct message repeated over and
over about whitey taking Indian land. We get it, white man bad, Indian
man good!I give it a 3, because it was nothing special at all. And partly to
compensate for the usual fraud brigade rigging these results with
ridiculously high ratings!

The Revenant exists only as Oscar-bait, and I have no doubt that
DiCaprio deserves the award for such a brutal role in tough conditions.
However, the rest of the film serves absolutely zero purpose, has no
deeper meaning, barely any story beyond the struggle for survival, and
almost collapses under the weight of its own self- importance. This is
not the first time that the story of Hugh Glass has been brought to
life, but its certainly the most alienating and depressing.We've seen this struggle done before. Tom Hanks in Cast Away is a
lasting example of an actor putting their body through hell and going
full-on cave man. Cast Away also dealt with the themes of loneliness,
sanity, and the need for direction. In the Revenant I knew almost
nothing of the inner workings of Glass or Fitzgerald (a rather
over-rated Tom Hardy performance). Glass seems to cope just fine with
being alone (the pretentious hallucinations of his family only puzzled
me), but I have a feeling that this was not the intention. As for
direction (within the movie, I mean) it is noble that all of it was
shot on location but there is no sense of space or place. We never know
where any of these characters are in relation to each other. Every new
location looks different from the last but we never have any
orientation or a grasp of the greater landscape. All it would have
taken is a five second shot of a map with any random character saying
"here we are, and this is where we are going".Alejandro González Iñárritu's pompous style of long, long takes is
completely inappropriate for this material and it took me out of the
movie every time he tried to pull it off. I don't want to believe I am
watching a documentary. I want to be excited and feel tension. The bear
attack scene was brutal, but I would have felt more fear and anxiety
had it actually be edited than done in one long shot. This kind of
direction is not the antidote to Michael Bay's 1000 cuts in a minute
nonsense. It was a mistake to shoot the film like this. Totally
unnecessary.As for the cinematography, a lot of people are praising it but it left
me unimpressed. I admire the fact that they fought to shoot it all
under natural light but almost every shot was wide and flat, wide and
flat, wide and flat, wide and flat. Not once was I in awe of any
spectacle or breathtaking natural beauty. Attenborough documentaries
are shot better than this and spend less time on indulgent cutaways.
Perhaps the grain and texture of 35mm could have fixed this.If you want a one man against nature story of survival then watch Cast
Away. If a grisly tale of genocide against a new world backdrop is what
you are after then Apocalypto is much better. The Revenant bored me and
I walked out of the cinema immensely disappointed.

And some good acting and great cinematography, but HIGHLY overrated. It
should be cut in half and it would still drag. The spirituals visions
don't really add much and at times make it difficult to follow what is
going on. But then the plot is so predictable you know what is going to
happen before it does, so you really just sit back and look at nice
scenery and some good acting without needing to follow the story
because you know exactly what will happen all the time. Anything the
least bit bloody is dragged out.If you liked "There Will be Blood" (another predictable pointless
movie, you will like this one. Personally I found both to boring and
poorly done.

Don't get me wrong because I've given this movie such low rating. I've
always loved DiCaprio's performance. Prior to release, when I read the
synopsis and bit googling about Hugh Glass, I started eagerly waiting
for the movie. However after watching all I could think was, even if
this movie wasn't ever made, nobody would've cared. The problem is not
with the acting or direction, cinematography etc. I just don't think it
was needed to be made as there's nothing great about it. Now I know
there are plenty of movies out there, which we don't care about. But
when Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a movie, it's like you must watch
it and enjoy. All this movie's about is survival (which isn't
highlighted as I'd hoped for) and revenge. The problem is that these 2
things are sort of ignored by the director. We see lots of Red Indians,
French bla bla!! Its hard to explain, perhaps someone with a better
command of language can explain better after watching.

This tedious movie is a humorless, monotonous, pretentious music video
that occasionally feels like a Leonardo DiCaprio showreel. It is
distractingly directed by the gimmicky showman Inarritu, whose Birman
is possibly the least dramatically interesting movie ever to win an
Oscar.And while a movie does not need to have have likable characters, it
should at least have interesting characters, and The Revenant has
neither. DiCaprio certainly looks uncomfortable in the snow, but since
there is nothing to his character but his affection for the young
native--a relationship that does not last very long--most of the movie
has a zero dimensional character struggling with the elements with
elaborate, gimmicky, cg-enhanced set pieces. Despite being played by a
talented actor, the lead is completely uninteresting and his quest for
revenge dull.This is the worst movie I've seen in the theater since the similarly
humorless, monotonous, and self-important movie, Precious. The politics
are very patronizing and simple minded and lacking any depth other than
the typical "we are all to blame" rehash that so many guilty and self
loathing people love, as exemplified by the "you are to blame!" and
truly laughable final shot.A feature length music video full of cg tricks, but wholly lacking in
characters, drama, humor, heart, and depth. Self-congratulatory,
egotistic garbage masquerading as important art that will unfortunately
fool a lot of people.

I actually feel guilty calling this movie boring. Everyone clearly put
in 110% making it. I'm sure they were exhausted every night in their
trailers. I know I felt a little weary just vicariously going through
their heroic efforts. Fortunately, watching on a computer, I could skip
chunks...hurry Leo along a little as he was crawling through some more
snow. I felt I was helping him get where he needed to be. By the time
he got there (a fort, I think) I was so bored I skipped the entire end.
The bear attack was pretty awesome however. This was like turning on the TV to watch a really good show but only
getting the static white noise, but then being expected to watch it.
The scenery was nice. I like snow.

This movie was so awesome that it actually convinced me of writing my
first review. Let's start with the good: very nice winter scenery with
top notch acting from Leonard DiCaprio. There's also lots of action
scenes, but did not find myself caring too much about the outcome. The
bad: very slow paced story about Chuck Norris crawling in the snow in
the 1800's. First 2 hours are about Glass surviving a bear maul attack,
being left for dead in a frozen forest with no water or food, survives
being dragged in a freezing river for miles, survives falling on a
horse of a cliff, etc. Come on, really? Then the revenge part takes
about 20 minutes: the bad guy flees an army fort with all the money,
and only 2 people go after him. Really? I was so bored I actually
noticed the sound track being really weird: it sounded like a broken
dripping faucet and it left me wondering if that's really a sound that
can be heard in a frozen forest during winter. Anyway, to sum it up,
I'm really disappointed for wasting 2.5 hours to see this.

Only in Hollywood could they take the life of Hugh Glass - a man whose
story needs no embellishment to rate as "astonishing" - and subvert it
to the point of disgrace. Using the rough outline of the Glass arc,
this movie adds absurd and, more vitally, totally unnecessary plot
lines about sex slave Indian daughters and martyred, fictional sons and
all manner of other rote plot devices in order to - I guess? - try and
dramatize a story about a guy who *literally* crawled 200 miles without
skin on his back in order to save his own life. As if Hugh needed the
posthumous help.Hardy might win an Oscar for his excellent performance as foil and I'm
sure Leo will get plenty of hype for grunting his way through 150
minutes. But man, they're both just shadows cast behind a movie that
could have been great.The writers could have fictionalized a plot loosely based on Glass's
life and rightly called it fiction. Or they could have made a great
movie about what actually happened and sold it as truth. Instead, they
manage go wrong in both directions. "The Revenant" dishonors Hugh
Glass, disrespects its audience, and desecrates a tale worth being told
much better than this. Your time would be better spent sleeping inside
a dead horse.

At 156 minutes, "The Revenant" is unwatchable, so it wasn't. After an
hour, instead skipped to watch a minute every three or four through to
the last twenty minutes which encapsulates the final conflict between
John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh Glass). Nothing
was missed for in between is Glass grimacing left then right.There is a harrowing, savage bear attack leading to Glass hanging to
life by a slender thread. Oddly, all that came to mind is how the
effects were accomplished. That goes to a lack of empathy for
protagonist Glass.This is a film of unquestioned artistic merit. Though some gush about
the cinematography, it is merely serviceable. It's not the
cinematography that's beautiful, it's the wilderness. All that's
required of an available light cinematographer is to set the frame and
F-stop. The actors most likely kissed pavement back in civilization
after shooting this demanding film. They did well under the
circumstances, particularly DiCaprio. The villain is the director and
the unreachable allegory he wrote on the script pages.In "Jodorowsky's Dune," the titular director made a few memorable
Seventies' films. When pitching "Dune," the studios requested a
standard length film - 120 minutes (not viable for a film from a story
this complex). But Jodorowsky wondered why it couldn't be ten hours or
twenty hours. He was clueless why the studios weren't funding him. The
doc is in part the story of a delusional, out-of-control ego. The
viewer may wish to slap his face. Enter Alejandro González Iñárritu who
also appears to have an ego of the same dimensions.God bless the artists, but not those who trade their expression for
self aggrandizement. Not only is "The Revenant" a vanity project, it is
Oscar bait.Awards should be given to those brave enough to sit through this slog.
It is a simple story raised to the power of crashing bore. "The
Revenant" is nearly incomprehensible, and filled with spiritual
mumbo-jumbo even Iñárritu most likely can't explain.See this if you relish masochism. It's a bet this film will bomb. Maybe
that will awaken Iñárritu. He's a genius. He just doesn't know how to
connect with an audience. He certainly doesn't here.

'Birdman' introduced Alejandro G. Iñárritu into the limelight last
award season, virtually stealing the Oscars with 9 nominations and 4
wins including Best picture and Directing. Now a year later and it's
the same story with 'The Revenant' being nominated for 12 this time
round. The academy aside... Can it really be as good as everyone is
saying?No. Good would be an understatement.'The Revenant' is and will always be one of those very rare films that
weren't just a trip to the cinema, but an experience. With the film
being a lengthy 2 hours 36 minutes I was pleasantly surprised that I
never had the urge to check my watch, because of how well the film
pulled me in. We are thrown into an intense, brisk, frozen adventure of
pure revenge but with far more depth and meaning than you may think.
Iñárritu uses his seemingly signature long takes to completely
submerged the viewer in the freezing temperatures, along with using
natural light and wide angle lenses to show the vast landscapes and
real settings that the characters are trying to survive in. Leonardo DiCaprio's 'Hugh Glass' as the desperate protagonist abandoned
by his fellow hunters after a brutal encounter with a bear, serves up
one of his best ever performances. Showing that he is more than capable
of expressing deep emotions with minimal dialogue. Tom Hardy's 'John
Fitzgerald' is an amazing antagonist who is being hunted by Glass to
seek revenge for leaving him for Dead. Hardy was great in the role,
adding yet another outstanding performance to his near flawless track
record of films and performances. Domhnall Gleeson is also in the film
as the hunting group's leader who does a decent job, further cementing
his status as an actor to watch out for with cinema-goers. Whilst the plot may sound relatively simple for a 2 and a half hour
film, you will never even think about the time as you'll be so immersed
in the dramatic, adventure thrill ride that you'll start to shiver from
the frozen environment. A must see for everyone!

As my title says - I have great expectations on this movie. Potential
Oscar winner, Leo DiCaprio, blah-blah. The only good thing on the whole
movie is the cinematography, the way the movie is shot and nothing
else. Even at the middle of this disappointment u can get with a
question "Why the hell Leo is here, Chuck Norris will fit way better of
that role of the undying revenging animal". And by saying animal ...
yeah the bear was the worst CGI i ever saw. Sorry - 1/10 for the big
expectations and very trashy movie. :/ 1/10 mean u can watch the movie,
but if you wanna save few brain cells - better find something better,
like American ninja 4 - same plot, different characters!

This movie is without doubt the worst revenge movie I have ever seen! I
can't believe Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy actually wasted their
time making this load of crap! Nothing happens for the first 2 hours of the film, except watching
Leonardo DiCaprio paw around in the snow after he was ripped to shreds
by a bear. Just imagine watching Uma Thurman (in Kill Bill) crawl
around on the hospital floor (after she wakes from her coma) as she
makes her way to the Pussy Wagon. That's the movie in a nutshell. What
happens after the bear attack is laughable - leaving only 15-20 mins
for Leo's revenge - and the fact that he survives this attack is
complete BS. No one could have survived this attack!Here's the sum of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is butchered by a bear,
falls down a waterfall and then thrown off a cliff. Somehow, beyond
credability, he manages to survive all this, and makes his way home to
spend 15-20 mins hunting down the guy his killed his son. 45 mins into
the movie, I wanted to walk out. Not worth seeing at the movies. AVOID
AT ALL COSTS! My girlfriend and I both hated it!If Leo wins an Oscar for this, it's should be for doing all the gross
things he needs to do in order to survive; like eating raw animals and
sleeping in the butchered carcasses of horses. 0 out 10 from me. Worst revenge story ever!!!

Leonardo DiCaprio is basically just screaming at this point in life.
The movie stunk. I think people forgot that movies are supposed to be
enjoyable. Even though things keep happening, with Indians and fighting
and killing, I didn't give a darn about the movie or anyone anyone in
it. I kept looking at the time. Which dragged on and on.This movie didn't have 5 minutes of story, let alone 2.5 hours. There's
one cool scene, and it lasts 3 seconds. Coolish.Don't believe the trailer. They hyped this garbage up, and put in a
plot, but there is none; just like with The Grey. You want to see it
because of Leonardo Dicaprio. Do yourself a favor and cry yourself to
sleep instead.

Yet another over the top movie with too many graphic effects and no
substance. At the end of the movie, I just sat there wondering what the
whole point of the movie was, because if I wanted to see raw violence,
I would just go on the Ogrish website and watch the be-headings and
other atrocities from ISIS.Perhaps it is this continuing pointless display of violence that causes
the manifestation of all the violence in this world.For me, the movie went wrong as soon as the bear attack happened. Of
course, only in Hollywood would it be possible to create an epic fight
between a bear, four to five times the size of the pro/antagonist, yet
with the bear still loosing the battle. What gives, though; as long as
there is an epic CGI battle with blood splattering all over the screen,
then the movie must be good.Truly disappointed in yet another Hollywood garbage movie that is meant
to excite the Zombies here in America.

The cinematography is excellent but the story is so unbelievable that
it snaps you out of the movie. The bear mauling if brutal then to be
left for dead no food and bleeding? Gun powder in your throat to
cauterize the wound? Body surfing down a river after all that in winter
which a healthy person could last about 10 min before hypothermia would
set in? Its not one thing, its not three things its the whole movie
that is one thing after another that anyone older than 6 would say this
is total Bull crap. You have to watch the movie to know that someone
had no idea what the hell it was like in the cold trying to survive
healthy not to mention half dead no food and Indians tracking you. I
believe Indiana Jones is more believable jumping out of planes with
rubber rafts. If you want a movie that just to kill time this will
work, but don't get the idea its going to be some great look on how
things were. Its an upscale B movie.

One of the best cinematic experiences I've had in my 50 odd years life.
There are movies with better stories or plots. Not great dialogues
either, but this is not what the film is about. What sets this film
apart is a visually overwhelming experience where you can almost feel
the hardships DiCaprio as Glass is going through yourself. Impressive
nature, great music, memorable scenes (and not only the bear),
painstaking emotion. And no, it's not necessary to have emotion in a
scene and explore it verbally for hours. That's not what they did in
those days anyway. This is the kind of film that stays with you long
after, for which you need to go to a cinema for the mind-blowing
camera-work. This is a trip for which you need no drugs. That's is to
say: if this is the kind of movie that suits your taste. If you think
it isn't: please give it a try.

Very gripping movie in the sense that it grips your attention and pulls
you into the world it creates. "The Revenant" is an immersive
experience. I found it harrowing but I was thrilled to be pulled into
another time when things with almost none of the creature comforts that
we take for granted.The story has so many surprising plot twists that it's astounding to
realize that it's a true story.I was thrilled that Leonardo DiCaprio won the Best Actor Academy for
this movie. In no way do I think that he was given the award because
the voters believe he finally deserved it. He out right won the award.Although it was one of the best movies of the year. It was not the Best
Movie of the year. As much as I like "The Revenant" I was pleased that
it didn't win. "The Spotlight" deserved to win. I never expected it
would because so seldom does the best movie actually win the Best Movie
Academy Award.

Utter, utter, utter, utter, waste of 2.5 hours of my life. One of the
most boring films I've seen. Unintelligible dialogue and no real story.
Leonardo Di Caprio is a fine actor and should have been given an Oscar
for Wolf of Wall Street instead of this tripe, where he hardly has to
act. OK, the conditions were harsh, but not as harsh as having to sit
in a cinema and watch this. Tom Hardy was mumbling, as ever, and seemed
to be a baddie for the sake of it. After an hour I was looking round
the cinema to see if anyone else was as bored as I was. Di Caprio's
character, Glass, is mauled, constantly frozen and wet, starved,
dehydrated, witnesses (in his delirium) his son being murdered and
rides off a cliff and yet I didn't really sense the suffering. Bilge.

He has done it again-Alejandro González Iñárritu brings us yet another
classic in the form of THE REVENANT,fresh off from his masterpiece
BIRDMAN.The Revenant is a westernized epic film, which takes place in the
frigid North American Wilderness during the early 1800s.The film
showcases a tour de force performance by none other than Leonardo
Dicaprio,who plays the indestructible Hugh Glass,a frontiersman bent on
avenging the death of a loved one and to take revenge on those who left
him for dead.His fellow fur trappers namely the conniving John
Fitzgerald(Tom Hardy) and the naïvely Jim Bridger played by William
Poulter,are left to care for the gravely injured Hugh Glass,but soon
his found to be a burden and is dumped in a shallow grave in which he's
left to die.What follows from then on is an epic tale of
endurance,revenge and survival.The true scope of The Revenant is not to be missed in theaters,because
honestly I don't think it was meant to be enjoyed any other way other
than in it's full boldness on the big screen.Alejandro González
Iñárritu's directing is superb if not groundbreaking,at times you
surrounded by vast frozen landscapes with its bleakness which is
seemingly brought to live by rampant wildlife;ensuring battles or some
sort of weather occurrence,and don't get me started on the characters
whose emotions are effortlessly captured with pure resilience,now that
is evidence that the director and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki had
a great understanding in putting together brilliant scenes from the
first to the very last one.Backed by an outstanding score consisting of
tribal drums,flutes and chants the film is populated with a strong lead
and supporting cast which deliver and do they deliver.This film is truly a magnificent piece of art and will be defined by
its sheer realism and extraordinary dedication endured by one man in
the harshest of places on earth.Clocking in at 2hours 30minutes,might
seem long but its duly worth your time and money. A Definite Must Watch

The short summary of the movie above basically is the movie. "A
frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for
survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of
his own hunting team." And then he comes back and gets his revenge. And
they drag this on for 2 and a half hours. No wonder there are so many
shots of they sky. Best actor? For what? Eating raw liver? Is that all
it takes to get best actor thesedays? No interesting dialogue or
confrontation. This is just a bad movie. Bad directing. Acting wasn't
bad but certainly wasn't Oscar worthy... or maybe it is worth it since
Oscar is worth garbage thesedays.

It's not about which story you tell. It's how you tell it that counts.Now, while the accuracy of this statement might be debatable, it is
certainly the truth in the case of The Revenant. Take the simplest
story you can think of, and tell it in a way that is artistically
striking. Not all films can pull it off, but this one does.Sure, some viewers will leave the theater with a feeling that there was
not enough substance here, that the movie drags itself too long, that
there isn't enough character development, that some scenes are
pointless as they don't advance the story, and may find the overall
experience too shallow.I advise you to look past those preconceptions. We're all too used to
the typical Hollywood formula. But we should not be afraid to try a
different approach to cinema. And honestly, this film isn't too alien
in that regard. It walks a fine line between film for the masses and
film for the artsy, hipster types, never drifting too far from one or
another, and so it achieves a perfect balance. Your average movie-goer
will be entertained throughout the experience. There is enough
suspense, action, drama, tears and blood to satisfy the needs of such a
consumer. But there's also more than that. There's some kind of poetry
going on, that you may feel but may not be completely aware of. Is it
due to the absolutely majestic environments? To the incredibly smart
cinematography? To the gorgeous soundtrack? To the slow but steady
pacing? It may be due to all those things, but there's also something
more. And that extra mile may have something to do with the very
believable acting. You don't feel like you're watching actors, you feel
like those are real people, with real, dangerous, short lives. You can
feel their emotions. Their fear, sadness, joy or anger is also your
own. Even the cold from the snowy and icy landscapes seems real, and
every time a character lights a fire, you can feel the warmth coming
back to your bones.There are, however, a couple of points where the immersion seems to
fail. Sometimes, the amount of punishment that Glass (the main
character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio) suffers is just too great for
him to realistically survive. It's not that it theoretically couldn't
happen, the thing is that, at certain points, you can feel it all comes
down to convenient story-telling. But don't let it deter you from
watching this movie. Any minor flaws are easily forgettable and
forgivable.Also, Leonardo DiCaprio nails it. As he always does.

The Revenant attempts grandness but ultimately lacks something.Maybe it is the lack of character establishment - we join the saga
already in progress and are given little reason to care about mountain
man guide Glass. Sure, the flashbacks show he had a hard loss and
dearly loves his son but who doesn't?Maybe it was the lack of visual variety - how many long shots looking
up at the vast sky through towering trees are enough? Terrence Malik he
is not.Maybe it was the lack of real geographical place. High granite mountain
ranges and vast open plains with roaring rivers. One group goes over a
high mountain pass to get to the fort, Glass goes down and around to
get to the same place.In the end, I just wasn't that moved. Although the snow avalanche was
nice.Also, the dialog was not in vernacular of the times. It detracted from
the overall effect to have characters saying things like "Jesus Christ"
and other contemporary expressions.just sayin'...

I'm new to reviewing films and this is my first official one so I'll
keep it short. The Revenant was undoubtedly an un-matched visual and
artistic experience, the film won the Oscar for Cinematography and when
you see the film it is easy to see why, every shot in this film is of
nature I have heard there was no use of artificial lighting! Northern
America has never been more grandly viewed than in this film. However
the film also tells a fantastic story of Vengeance, trust and survival,
it does all of this without ever feeling pretentious or over the top.
Leonardo gives a brilliant performance and as we all know, this is
Leo's first Oscar win, although he is criticised for a lack of
dialogue, Leo makes of for this with his physical expression and
stress. Action scenes in this movie are above anything I have ever
seen, in a certain battle containing Tom Hardy (who also gives an
outstanding performance) it was so hard to both watch, and turn away,
and although there are limited major conflict scenes in this film
(which never feels disappointment) every battle is so beautifully
tense, brilliantly shot and choreographed, I can honestly say I had no
idea what to expect and tried hard not to blink. Finally, I would like
to say that this film is not for the impatient, the film often takes
its time to display its epic cinematography which is obviously not for
everyone. I will never give a 10/10, but this film got extremely close,
definitely one of my favourite films.

Alejandro G. Iñárritu's film has Oscar nominations written all over it.
The film begins with a bloody conflict between a group of fur trappers
and a marauding bunch of native Indians; Emmanuel Lubezki's dazzling
photography not only captures its bloodiness but sets it against the
washed-out colors of a barren landscape, making us painfully aware of
how the elements remain indifferent to human activity. The standards of
cinematography are excellent throughout: Lubezki is particularly fond
of the lengthy panning shot in which the human characters are depicted
as mere specks on landscapes that almost seem to swallow them up.And then there is the stellar central performance of Leonardo DiCaprio
as Hugh Glass. He does not have many lines, but director Iñárritu
concentrates on his sufferings as he quite literally rises from the
dead on at least two occasions while trying his best to cope with the
exigencies of a harsh winter. There are some memorable moments - for
example, when Glass takes the guts out of a dead horse and crawls
inside its corpse, thereby creating a cocoon to protect himself against
the snow. In another sequence he manages to evade a posse of native
Indians by concealing himself against a river bank, and then swimming
out towards the rapids. Although buffeted by an apparently inexorable
tide, he manages to cling on to some driftwood and thereby ensure his
survival. We have to admire the actor's courage as he (or his stunt
doubles) subject themselves to a series of almost unendurable tests of
physical and mental courage. It is hardly surprising that DiCaprio won
the Best Actor Oscar at the 2016 ceremonies.But lush photography and stellar performances do not necessarily make a
great movie. THE REVENANT is 156 minutes long; the plot unfolds at a
leisurely (some might say almost a snail's) pace, with plenty of
attention given to the central conflict between Glass and his
arch-rival Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The first half of the movie offers a
convincing depiction of the trappers' existence, and how they struggle
to survive while trying to make a buck. Unfortunately the second half
turns into a rather hackneyed revenge thriller set on an unforgiving
landscape. One can't help but remember that classics such as George
Stevens's SHANE (1953) told the same story in a much more economical
(and dramatically effective) way.In the end we are left with the feeling that, while THE REVENANT has a
historically convincing story to tell, director Iñárritu somehow missed
the opportunity to do so.

I went to see it last night. I wasn't disappointed and enjoyed every
second of it. The cinematography and the acting is superb. Its content
raw, violent and the story pulsating. Señor Iñarritu, Mr. Di Caprio &
Mr. Lubezki all deserve the Oscars they got. This is a project of
blood,sweat & tears. The graphic content and intensity of some scenes
was too much for some people. Btw: What I particularly liked about the
movie was the quiet which also seemed to be an unbearable element for
some of my fellow moviegoers. In the rear row were 3 British lads in
suits who had to fill these breaks with their constant tedious BlaBla.
As I wrote in the title: this movie is only for a certain audience.
Those folks who are able to enjoy the quiet and nature and art.

A highly anticipated contender for Oscars, "The Revenant" landed with
winning the coveted awards for Best Director and Best Actor, giving
Leonardo Di Caprio his much awaited Oscars and losing Best Picture to
"The Spotlight." The film deserves a heavy applause for two very strong
reasons. The first for the superb cinematography it uses which gives
the depiction of the 18th century America and an expedition of the
hunters in the snow capped mountains of North America. The landscapes
and the camera angle chill your spines and frightens for the force of
nature and isolation it can bring. For most of the part, the film uses
the natural landscape than computer generated images which has
dominated film making for quite a time which makes it a visual treat.
The second reason to admire the film is the superb performance of
Leonardo Di Caprio, who appears away from his Titanic fame boyish
performances which he has been giving most of the time. Without much of
the dialogues, he somewhat gets into the skin of the character
sparkling the screen in his presence.Undoubtedly, the film is flawless technically and sets a benchmark in
the cinematographic achievement in movies. But regarding the story and
script, the film lacks a tightness and fails to grip at times. The
tightness of Alejandro's earlier movies "Amorres Perros" and "Babel" is
somewhat missing in this one. The film becomes a survival game in the
wilderness of American landscape, somewhat familiar from Tom Hank's
"Cast Away." Then the film draws to a revenge story where the
protagonist avenges for the desolation from his friend who attempts to
kill him and his son, which seems pretty obvious. There isn't much
substance in the story and it somewhat drags and is interested in
holding the viewers for the star power of Di Caprio with scars and
anticipation to be free from the desolation rather than the story. Had
the story been tighter and the length been trimmed a bit, the film
could have been much memorable.Rating: 2.5 stars out of 4

For me, a more appropriate title for 'The Revenant' would have been
'The Neverend'.... At 2 hours and 36 minutes, the film, which was shot
outdoors in Canada, U.S.A and Argentina, is beautifully framed and
filmed , glorious to watch- for an hour or so , but as compelling
cinema - i beg to disagree!Leonardo turns in a competent performance but didn't deserve an Oscar
for this one.Anyway it was an award overdue so guess its OK. Watch it
if 'Nat Geo' is one of your favourite channels and also if you have the
time and patience. There have been interesting similarity's drawn
between the composition of scenes from Andrei Tarkovsky's films and the
framing of quite a few of Innaritu's shots in The Revenant. Decide for
yourself.

The four-way battle of man vs. man vs. nature vs. himself has never
been construed in the way The Revenant does in this Oscar-nominated
epic survival film. Once again, Alejandro González Iñárritu blesses us
with a masterclass visual poetry as he cements his spot into one of the
world's visionary directors in cinema. The Revenant, inspired by true
events, tells the gruesome tale of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), an
experienced frontiersman on a fur-trading expedition to a journey to
retribution after being abandoned by his comrades. Stuck amid miles of
harsh and uncharted wilderness, Glass is fueled by only two things to
survive: his insurmountable love for his family and his desire for
revenge.Snippets of peaceful life and the sound of soothing calm water open the
film, and we are subjected to this dream-like meditative state of life,
a false security from the maelstrom that ensues in the next frame 
when a gang of Hawkeyes and Katniss Everdeens Arikara Native Americans
lay slaughter on Glass' fur-trapping team. In this thrilling one- take
action sequence, the film's first arrow whooshes through a mouth and
then a series of sheer carnage follows. Shotguns are fired, axes are
swung, faces are bashed. For the love of pelts, the Peter Pan books
taught as wrongthis is what war among aboriginals looks like. The film
begins with a testosterone-driven start but in its entirety the film
succeeds in bringing out heavy themes of loss and redemption.Full review here: www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-revenant

First of all: Yes, I am glad that Leo got the Oscar. Finally. 'bout
time. Although I have to say that he had about a dozen movies deserving
it better than this!A man witnesses the murder of his son and ever after fights his way
through all obstacles to take revenge on the murderer. So far, so fair.
Anyone being a parent would relate to that one. But anyone who has lost
a dear one will also know: Hate, pain and desperation can be eased by
nothing... ... except maybe forgiveness. Only like half an hour into
the movie I knew: He mustn't get his revenge. If this movie is worth
only a penny he mustn't get his revenge. The rest is quite a bit to
watch. Lots of very beautiful landscape shoots. A hell of a lot of
blood and guts and disgust. Leo is suffering and suffering and
suffering, he fights and fights and still keeps on fighting. In the end
he arrives at the Fort, he finds his enemy, he dares him and at this
point of the story you start asking yourself what's this all about.
What is the point? What does it want to tell us? The murderer says a
quite reasonable thing in the end. He says: This is your revenge, enjoy
it, but it will not bring your son back. That's it. It will not bring
him back. There are too guys with nothing left to loose and they lay in
the snow fighting each other, trying to cut off as many limbs as
possible but - why? Where's the sense? They could stand for the
insanity of mankind itself. Could be. Next moment the Revenant
remembers something: Revenge is not upon man it is only upon god. This
would have been a good punch line. Let go of it, it doesn't bring you
any relief. However revenge is not upon god in that movie, at least not
if god isn't an old Indian chief who was in search of his kidnapped
daughter all along. The Revenant lets go off his enemy and witnesses
how he gets killed by the Indian tribe. He himself gets spared because
he accidentally saved the life of the Indian princess earlier. The end
is a bit ... flat. Uninspired. Plain. Would have been waiting for more
deepness. Leo had a bunch of real deep roles in other movies making of
him the actor he is and for being the actor he is he got the Oscar.
It's alright with me.

The film is well acted, well made, nice scenery. But the story is
really thin. It has won a lot of awards, but only because there wasn't
really any competition. Having said all that, the bear attack was good,
even if it was played by a cartoon bear......I always have had a soft
spot for Yogi, and I'm glad he's still getting some work, even if it's
just supporting parts. A bit of a come-down from fronting your own
series, but at least he's still getting a gig. I found The Revenant to
be just a series of events strung together, a bit like the plots in
formulaic TV series, one thing happens followed by another, you get to
the end and think...so what... Good stories have twists and turns, with
sub-plots that weave themselves around each other, go off at tangents
and finally meet at the end for the money shot. Well, none of that
happens here. This film was a missed opportunity.

The movie is at best 'good', actually its an average story, very
linear.The cinematography was commendable, mostly no background music gives it
a special feel, bear scene is the creme of the movie and not Leo's
acting. Leo was good, but nothing special like Wolf, Shutter, Beach,
Django. The Oscar was, in my opinion, obligatory.Getting back to the movie, after watching Bridge of Spies, Spotlight,
The Big Short, I was counting on this one to be equally good, after all
it was nominated at the same scale. To my disappointment it was quite
boring and unimpressive.Maybe if you watch with low expectations, you'll like it.

Well, glass has a crazy fight with a bear and the bear almost kills
him(he's beating and biting glass for like 15 minutes) and then they
fight again and they roll down a hill hugging each other and the heavy
bear ends up lying on glass! Glass is beaten to death and bleeding like
hell , when after some time, his crew find him and try to heal him with
nothing ! (I mean they are in the middle of a jungle and the story
happens around 1820 ). They carry him for an hour ,no real food , no
nothing. They leave him alone in that jungle he has apparently lost
tons of blood and most of his bones are smashed. But surprisingly
(stupidly!) he succeeds to crawl towards his son's body have a little
chat with him like they are in central park and nothing is wrong. He
crawls some more, after hours he finds food he meets an Indian. The
Indian cures glass better than any doctor in 21st century, with some
ashes only. He's fine again so he goes for another adventure and falls
off a canyon ! He survives again , the crew find him again he goes for
another adventure , he kills the man who killed his son , but this time
glass finally dies just because he got a few knife stabs.

i really anticipated to watch this movie and see if all the hype about
it was justified .to cut right to the
chase,cinematography,picture,effects and performance of Leo are all
worthy of the buzz with bleak winter nature being the main
character.but this kind of movie with no real story and dialogue to
support it, is a heavily reminiscent of a Terence Malick movie (not his
late ones)and he (Malick)is better to this kind of movies.nothing new
to the way Alejandro González Iñárritu decides to tell the story as i
said before is almost as copying Malick's way of direction and to some
extend Nicolas Winding Refn's Valhalla Rising.if you are into those
kind of films, you will enjoy this one but ''the revenant'' is not
s'thing we 've never seen before.

This was the film which enraptured my mind long before when I saw its
trailers. Innaritu always comes up with some soul wrenching stuff that
stays with you for a long time even after watching it loosely. Creative
thoughts, mind boggling scripting and beguiling cinematography all
leading to a smart conventional film. And what else remains to make a
film more grasping and scintillating? Leonardo Dicaprio with his not
the best but enlightened acting steals your every nerve to praise the
beauty of the film. This is the drama you might want to forget what
Innaritu did with his previous Birdman. If Birdman gained an Oscar for
a mild direction, this is a sure winner in most of the compartments.
Each dialogues or I should say each quotes used in the film is
inspirational. The scenes will seize your heart with all it's beauty
and you might want to embrace it all after the movie. If you are in
search for some stunning film this one surely is for you. What makes
this film a little average is the pace it runs with in the second half.
Leonard's character should have got some more words to share but it's
alright as long as the film is more enlightening.

I am seeing quite a few bad reviews for this movie and all I can think
is how? How could anyone have thought this movie was even slightly bad?
This movie is almost three hours long but it does not even feel that
long when watching it because it is so action packed and has scenes in
it that will completely suck you in and just blow your mind. Also, this movie had the most beautiful cinematography and special
effects. And while there is not that much actual dialogue throughout
the movie it does not need it because the events that happen in this
movie speak more than dialogue ever could.Another thing I would like to say is that Leo definitely earned his
Oscar win for his performance in this movie, his win was long overdue.
Well deserved win for Leo and a ten out of ten performance on his part. All that being said, this movie was astonishing in so many ways. And it
gets a 9 out of 10 stars from me.

Oscar winner for best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), best director
(Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and best cinematography (Emmanual Lubezki), THE
REVENANT is an epic production and in truth Nature is the leading
character. The film is a visual spectacle, the themes of survival and
for love between a father and son are moving, but this is a long song
and requires endurance on the part of the viewer for sitting through
156 minutes of repetitious gore and raw natural elements. The film is
based in part on a novel by Michael Punke, and the screenplay is by
Mark L Smith and Alejandro G. Iñárritu.The film may be excessively long but the story can be quickly
summarized: While exploring the uncharted wilderness in 1823, legendary
frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) sustains injuries from a
brutal bear attack. When his hunting team leaves him for dead, Glass
must utilize his survival skills to find a way back home to his beloved
family (his son Hawk - Forrest Goodluck  dies on the same trip).
Grief-stricken and fueled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry
terrain to track down John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), the former confidant
who betrayed and abandoned him.The hunting troops are well portrayed by Tom Hardy (very difficult to
understand his mumbling accent), Domhnall Gleeson. Will Pouster (a very
talented young actor), Forrest Goodluck et al. But the overwhelming
power of the film is the depiction of man in Nature and the concept of
survival against all odds. For that aspect alone the film is well worth
seeing.

This movie is simply a journey through the minds of director Alejandro
G. Inneritu and Emmanuel Lubezki, fuelled with creativity and flair
from the offset. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous. It is an
honour to watch such a spectacularly filmed movie, it's almost like a
dream. Although some shots may seem repetitive (low angle tree shots)
the shots seem relevant and important to the film as it focuses on the
harsh reality of nature and the environment in which we live in. The
representation of the 19th century is also a brilliantly executed
aspect of this movie, showing the viewer what times were like in the
era and how difficult it was to earn money.The narrative of this film is simple yet underestimated. Revenge is
always a tricky topic to cover for film makers, as sometimes it can end
up being somewhat far fetched or cheesy, but this time, it was really
effective and had me hooked from the moment Hugh Glass' journey to find
Hardy begins. The acting is always the crucial part of any film, and in
this particular film, it needed to be the best performance for all
involved, which would be tricky as DiCaprio and Tom Hardy have had
extremely impacting careers. As for Tom Hardy, this was undeniably his
best 'Supporting Actor' role, showing the fierce, unrelenting nature of
his character and in end, rewarding the actor with his first Oscar
nomination. For DiCaprio, I believe it was up there with his best
performances, but the lack of dialogue from his character could not
mean that it was his best unfortunately. This does not in any way mean
that his performance was anything other than world class and he
deserved all credit received from this film, if not more, for me, The
Wolf of Wall Street was his best, closely followed by his short spell
as Calvin Candie in Django Unchained.Overall, the film showed positive signs in all aspects, notably visual
effects, make up and costume design, as well as the obvious directing
and acting, but it was not perfect. However, I would recommend the film
to any passionate film fan, especially fans of cinematography and
directing.

Glass lives with the spirit of his slaughtered wife and in the last
shot appears to rejoin her in the spirit world. Indeed the title may
connote dreamer and avenger but it literally means a returning spirit.
As he says before his last mission, "I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd
done it already." Hawk says to the moribund Glass, then Glass says to
dead Hawk what he said to his dead wife: "I'm right here. You hear me?"
The spirits are there to address. This rebuts Fitzgerald's last remark:
"You came all this way just for your revenge, huh? Did you enjoy it,
Glass?... 'Cause there ain't nothing' gon' bring your boy back."The Revenant is a classic case of style over substance. Fantastic
actors, slipping effortlessly into a range of clichéd characters,
stunning cinematography, and zero emotion. I'm a crier, I will cry at
the majority of films and TV shows (and occasionally books), so the
fact that I not only didn't cry, but felt absolutely nothing towards
any of the characters, says it all.

Don't deem The Revenant shallowly a revenge thriller, Just as the
subhead " Bloody lost, Life found." implies, there is more beyond the
poetic beauty of nature and the breathtaking revenge plot. There is sin of the North America colonist, the director make a white
man suffering all these to bring more sympathy to the autochthons.
mauled by brutal bear (they have already accustom to the struggle with
nature ) is actually not a very big deal, the slaughtered wife and
murdered son(in front of his face) are most unbearable things for every
human on earth, that's those millions of autochthons suffered. Glass got his revenge, got his life's back, what about the others? As
we seen the autochthon who have the same fate was hanged by the French
colonist...

Adapting the mostly true experiences of fur trapper Hugh Glass that
took place in Montana and South Dakota in 1823, "The Revenant" is an
amazing existential tale of survival and revenge that'll leave you
feeling gutted and skinned, thanks to the remarkable vision and
cinematic artistry of the great Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the director of
last year's multi-Oscar-winning "Birdman", and who has just won his
second Best Director Oscar for "The Revenant". He was also the Mexican
genius who gave us three narrative-juggling films of great humanism:
"Amores Perros", "21 Grams" and "Babel", the latter I consider his
masterpiece.Forget the stories of its difficult production (being filmed in
authentic remote and bitter cold locations), and how star Leonardo
DiCaprio actually suffered throughout by being immersed in freezing
water, stuffed into a horse carcass or actually consuming a bison
liver, what you'll bear witness to on the screen will pull you
completely into its stark, ruthless, primal world and hold you there,
thanks to DiCaprio's career-best performance as the film's protagonist
which justifiably earned him his first Best Actor Oscar. The film is
long (arguably too long) and unrelentingly slow, but few viewers will
find themselves bored due to its calculated hypnotic pull, completely
enwrapping viewers in its frozen world almost as much as Lean's
"Lawrence of Arabia" put us in the desert. Above all, it has two
sequences that will stay with you forever: the grizzly bear attack
which occurs, as do many sequences, in one seemingly single long take
-- but I found even more effective the first Indian assault. That scene
delivers such brutal realism I actually felt terrified as never before
in a movie theater due to the scene's directorial staging of the
trappers' panicking while the Indians' arrows frenetically strike the
men's flesh with the force of stinging missiles. This scene makes every
other Indian attack I've ever seen in a film postured and artificial.Iñárritu is a Mexican genius, born in 1963, who managed to build up an
extensive amount of cultural experiences through early travels,
beginning at age 17 by crossing the Atlantic on a cargo ship then
working his way across Europe and Africa. After his journeys, he
returned to Mexico City, majored in communication, then began a career
as a radio station host interviewing rock stars and hosting live
concerts while single-handedly building WFM into the number one station
in Mexico. All these experiences apparently became the source of his
eclectic filmography, beginning with writing and directing a famous
Mexican TV pilot, "Behind the Money", and making a few short films
before beginning his feature career with "Amores Perros" in 2000. His
best work conveys a cinematic exuberance close to a Mahler symphony in
its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering
the human experience. "The Revenant" finds him at his most obsessive
and committed during its long shoot in a way reminiscent of the epics
of David Lean: an 80-day principal photographic schedule in the coldest
weather at locations so remote it required more than nine months in
unbearably torturous conditions, all due to Iñárritu's refusal to use
computer-generated imagery (saving the few effects scenes that
necessitated it). The director's monomania for realism became so
intolerable that many crew members walked off the project (or were
fired), and Tom Hardy wound up attacking the director, nearly
strangling him. The efforts of Iñárritu (and his collaborators) can be
seen in the final production.Cinematographer Emmaunuel Lubezki (whose nickname is 'Chivo' which
means 'goat' in Spanish) has an affinity with this director (he won an
Oscar for Iñárritu's "Birdman" before winning one for "The Revenant").
After tests on 35mm and 65mm film stock, Lubezki and director Iñárritu
decided to shoot "The Revenant" on 6K high-resolution digital to be
able to schedule one more hour of shooting time per day, almost
exclusively in natural light for authenticity. And since lensing
Alfonso Cuarón's "Children of Men", Chivo has been justifiably famous
for long unbroken takes (in fact, most of "Birdman" is constructed as
if its entire drama is uninterrupted by a cut), and he continues that
tradition, if in a less obvious fashion, with "The Revenant" in its
Indian assault and grizzly bear attack..Though the film ultimately does not attain formal perfection, I left
the theater carrying a new life experience unlike anything I'd seen
before, achieved through Iñárritu's singular vision conveying a
quintessential portrait of the American wilderness with great cinematic
poetry. One of the year's most significant achievements in film.

I was freezing on his behalf the whole movie.It as not realistic, several times he is freezing before getting wet
and still manage to survive. Most people can only survive minutes in
the cold river. His wounds are recovering faster than the Terminator. The movie is simply to long.The best part of the movie is actual the discussion of killing a
colleague as the most humane thing to do, and the effect fear and cold
having an impact on peoples decisions.I admit Leonardo is good in the movie and he deserves his Oscar - but
still the movie is boring

The opening scene was great excellent cinematography, directing,
editing and all the rest of the whole Hollywood Oscar thing of it...The
following scenes were all fairly decent but after about 30 minutes into
the film it just grinded to a slow crawling pace pun intended with long
extended shots of yada, yada, yada... I love the scenery but some of
the long extended pain and flashback scenes were just a but much...The
biggest problem I had with this film are the major inconsistencies with
the weather snow levels to be exact. (Maybe Global Warming is so bad it
is causing our greatest American commodity to be messed with that being
the Film Industry) I know it is very hard to match up weather with
shooting sequences but come on Alejandro you can do better after that

OK, well, this was like watching a National Geographic documentary with
breathtakingly beautiful nature shots interrupted by scenes of the most
extreme and crude brutality I think I have ever seen. Undoubtedly
hyoerealistic, at the limit of believeabioity (I know, it is based on a
real story, but this does not make its cinematographic representation
realistic...); the story is weak, the dialogues almost absent apart the
conitnued grunting of LdC - Tom Hardy, in his fake Texan accent, is
virtually ununderstandable. LdC won the Academy Award (long overdue...)
but it seems to me more an Oscar to his career (he performed equal if
not better in another half dozen movies). Overall not a bad movie, just
oberrated.

After Birdman, I expected great things from Iñarritu (even though I
consider Birdman a little overrated). He is great at visualizing what
he wants his film to look like and proceed to create his vision, but
I've had trouble getting into his stories. The Revenant is no
different, beautifully shot but with definite story issues.From the brutal opening scene to the vicious climax, The Revenant is
filled with gorgeous depictions of the wilderness capturing the beauty,
and ugliness of nature. When it came to the fight scenes, the camera
remained close to the actors making us feel we were right there with
them but also, there were very little cuts, if any, during these
intense scenes making every punch, every kick, every cry for help
appear real instead of staged.Again, Iñarritu was blessed at directing a top notch cast of actors.
DiCaprio, again, stole the show. He seemed to have gone to hell and
back as he played much of the role of Hugh Glass alone but got the
occasional friendly hand along the way. He gave lots of emotion and
life to a man I knew little about beforehand and made me feel his pain
through all his suffering. And Tom Hardy was right up there with him
acting wise as the realist of the group who came off as a hardass half
the time. He may have been the antagonist, but there was meaning to
what he was doing. Now, that doesn't mean I'm glamorizing or agreeing
with everything he did, but there are many films out there where the
antagonist does what they do for no reason just so there's a conflict
present. Besides these two actors, there also solid appearances from
the up and coming actors of Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson who
appears to be everywhere nowadays.Now my biggest problem with the story is the "Why should I care?" or
the "Why do I need to know his story?" part. Before this movie, I've
never heard of Hugh Glass. At the beginning, he seemed like an okay guy
who did what he had to do for he and his boy to survive. By the end, he
seems crazy. In between, he went through hell and never quit no matter
how close he was to death. But why would I care? This idea has been
used before with movies such as True Grit or Memento where we learn
more about the main character and who they truly are, as a person while
seeking out their vengeance. With The Revenant, I get the same feeling
at the beginning, middle, and end towards High Glass. So why did I need
to hear a story about him in the first place? Seems like Hollywood just
wanted to do a massive CGI bear fight because of this guy.The Revenant is a very good film, definitely one of the best shot films
of 2015, but it's still missing something that keeps me from seeing it
as an extraordinary film overall. I think Iñarritu got exactly what he
was envisioning and he has a great cinematic eye, just not for
storytelling.

BEWARE  CONTAINS SPOILERS! Oh my, what a horrifyingly heroic journey Hugh Glass and I have
endured. There was power in that there movie, something universal,
mighty and indestructible about the human spirit. Intense, involving
and beautiful though it was, I was wondering why Hugh had not gone to
meet the great trapper in the sky about 20 minutes in. Sometimes it was
all so implausible I had an attack of the involuntary giggles. I can
suspend my rational mind for the sake of art, and get swept along by
the story, but there was just sooo much that would make a Boy Scout
with a camping trip or two under his belt want to scratch his head
until it was raw. For starters  all this standing for lengthy periods up to the knees in
freezing winter water and keeping on one's wet cold soggy trousers and
boots afterwards. If the Fitzgerald had not murdered Hugh's son, such
antics would have. I mean how could he even feel his appendages? Good
Pawnee genes or not, frostbite, hypothermia or maybe gangrene would
surely have done for him. At the other end of the excitement spectrum
was the grizzly attack. Even if a helicopter had swooped in and carried
Hugh off to the trauma unit, he could hardly have survived it. Oh Hugh, all that whole body immersion in a freezing, ferociously
tumbling river, even if it didn't drown you would have caused your body
to seize up with life-threatening shock in seconds. The blood would
have rushed from your periphery to your core organs, leaving your brain
blank and befuddled. Perhaps that's why your speech stayed
unintelligible ad nauseam and you made funny decisions like wearing
that fur poncho effort with the fur facing outwards, mountain man
style, rather than inwards to warm your perishing core. The brain hypoxia could explain why you just kept walking and walking
with no idea where you were going, just spiritual guidance from his
missus (always clad in unseasonably light Laura Ashley hippy attire).
OK, she's a spirit, I know. But hats off to you for your uncanny Boy
Scout sense of direction. Dib dib. Oh yeah, and that horse jump over the precipice. Yikes! Incidentally,
did all those chasing riders manage to pull up? Really? Hmm. Jeez, Hugh
might have had his fall broken by that super-tall pine but for all we
know, he could have floated down on a snowflake. His oxygen deprived
and now semi-concussed brain is getting madder. And madness makes you
strong. So he decides to make like a horse, slice its belly and heave
out the massive innards. For a minute, I thought he might dine on them
as it's been a while since the raw buffalo liver, but he cosies down
for the night in the bloody body cavity stark bollock naked. No jim
jams. No hotty. He'd have woken at dawn in this horse shaped freezer
with an annoying draught piercing that belly crack straight onto his
perishables. So out he climbs after a good old smelly kip and pulls on his nice dry
clothes. How come after a night in the blizzard? I can only put that
down to the missus hanging them on some heavenly radiator overnight.Oh and there are other things. How exactly did the captain manage to
make his mount walk forwards, err.. while dead? Why did only two of
them pursue Tom Hardy when there was a fort full of men to help? We
will never know. One thing's for sure, his lips had their own story to
tell, and proved a diverting subplot. Spittle, blubber, bloody spittle,
and more spittle. Then scaly, chapped to pieces, and super scaly like a
dead fish. Phew! No wonder Powaqa gave him that look of muted disgust
as she rode past at the end. It all explains why no one kissed him
hello at the fort gates. I'm sure at the end, his wife was giving him that 'Darling, that's
really enough now isn't it?' look. 'Time to come in for a cuppa and
Eastenders '. Go to her Hugh and put your feet up.

This is an amazing movie ! It depicts the scenario of a mountain man
and his fateful survival story..... After a major, brutal,
blood-curdling, spine-chilling event (which you will come to know when
you watch the film), this survivor is left alone......to die. Will he
survive ? Experience the ultimate test of 'Survival of the Fittest.'
Great performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and others as well.
This movie correctly portrays those 'dark elements' of human nature -
violence, hatred, sadness, wounds and scars, betrayal, etc.Each and every person may not like this movie and it's definitely not
for the faint-hearted, for many scenes showcase true survivor / death /
sudden violence with a blood and gore fashion. Cinematography / scenic
beauty of the wilderness is beautifully captured in this film; it is an
immersive experience in itself, which must be experienced on the big
screen !!!

THE REVENANT is directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu and stars Leonardo
DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhall Gleeson.Set in the 1820s we follow the members of a fur trading group who
operate under incredibly dangerous conditions. Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is
simply plying his trade with the help of his son, and is clearly an
individual who is scarred by the events of his past, something we are
alluded to throughout the film.One of his expedition partners John Fitzgerald (Hardy) is a passionate
man, one who simply wants to be paid his way, no matter what the cost.
They are both lead by Captain Andrew Henry (Gleeson) who tries his best
to keep order and stability in the group as they attempt to return
home.Each actor in this film gives a stellar performance, particularly
DiCaprio and Hardy who play two very different but incredibly intense
characters which you are unable to take your eyes off. Hardy is
menacing, brooding and unforgiving, whilst DiCaprio is passionate and
intense in equal measure. If both of these actors don't win an Oscar
for their efforts they will no doubt feel hard done by, especially
DiCaprio, who gives one of the best performances of his career.Will Poulter also gives an engaging performance as the character of
Bridger and Domhall Gleeson, an actor I admire greatly, does well here
too. There is also a strong showing from the unknown entity Forrest
Goodluck, who plays Hawk, the son of DiCaprio's character. A muted but
incredibly polished performance will surely lead to great things for
this young actor.Iñárritu directs each of these actors incredibly well and
professionally pulls us into this dog eat dog world where no one can be
trusted. The cinematography is gorgeous, offering us sweeping, intense
shots of the desolate and unforgiving landscape we find our characters
within. The decision to film using only natural light was an incredibly
admirable choice and one which pays off massively, lending the film an
intense realism that is hard to pull away from.My criticisms of this film are few, however I do have some gripes.
Mainly with the pacing of the film which at times can be incredibly
slow and measured, allowing the tension to build up, which may put off
some viewers who are hoping for an action packed DiCaprio romp. The
opening is a cataclysm of spectacle, but this slows down very quickly
and we move along at a canter until the dramatic moments of the final
act. The score on the other hand was a very muted but hauntingly
beautiful work which punctuated and complimented every single scene it
featured, making up for the somewhat snail pace and long, drawn out
shots of the landscape which while beautiful, offered little to the
flow of the story except as filler between story beats.The most intense and incredible moment of this film is without doubt
the infamous bear scene, which involves DiCaprio coming face to face
with the brutal beast in what is a harrowing five minutes for the
viewer, one which is both intensely realistic and fiercely brilliant.
Without spoiling anything it is one of the most enthralling scenes
you'll see this year and the execution of it is fantastic. DiCaprio
really showing his incredible acting range in this film, particularly
here.The Revenant while slow, is an excellent piece of film making with a
stand out performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, which should win him the
Oscar he has been striving for all these years come and gone.For more reviews go to www.filmathon.co.uk

Plot: A fur trading expedition goes wrong and wildered after an attack
by the Native Americans. The onus is on tracker Hugh Glass (DiCaprio)
to get the team safely back. The pursuit becomes more complicated when
Glass is viciously attacked by a 500lb grizzly bear. When his team is
unable to carry him further, they leave him behind after paying
mercenary John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) to stay back until Glass breathes
his last. The untrustworthy Fitzgerald betrays Glass by the worst means
possible. Thus begins the ruthless quest for survival and revenge.For starters, The Revenant is a visual spectacle from scene one. Ace
Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has two back-to-back Oscars to
his name for his impeccable work in Gravity and Birdman, hits the
bull's eye yet again. Each frame is a work of art in itself, a feast
for the eyes. Based in the nineteenth century, the film is shot in the
most exquisite of locations in Argentina and Alberta and look almost
heavenly. Alejandro G. Inarritu, the Mexican import who dished up the
intense drama 'Birdman' last year helms a project much more complicated
and ambitious. And he checks all boxes, well almost.The film, which looks like an extended episode of Bear Grylls' 'Man Vs
Wild', seems a tad too disbelieving at times.From Cast Away to 127
Hours, we've all seen survival films where the odds are heavily against
the leading man. But Inarritu's protagonist, who by the way is
'loosely' inspired by a true character and true story, goes through
stuff that even the manliest of Bollywood heroes wouldn't be able to
endure.From getting ripped off and shattered by a merciless wild bear
(in a spine chilling sequence- a highlight of the movie), to defying
the Arikara warriors on multiple occasions, to falling off cliffs, to
getting washed away in menacing streams, Glass has to be the toughest
man to have ever walked on planet earth to survive it all.That probably
is the only flaw in the otherwise flawless project. Innaritu's camera
work is thrilling and mesmerising (Kudos to the brand new 6.5k ARRI 65
camera which makes its debut). His cast couldn't have been better. Will
Poulter does a fine job. Tom Hardy, whose look reminds you of Game of
Throne's 'The Hound', puts up a solid performance. At times, you cannot
help get a reminiscence of Bane due to the similar voice pitch. All
said, at the end of the day, The Revenant is a film made for Leonardo
DiCaprio. Oxford dictionary might have to come out with fresh
adjectives to describe his no-holds-barred performance, it is that
good.He fights a grizzly wild beast. He eats raw bison body parts. He sleeps
in animal carcasses (The latter two for real to attain authenticity).
He does it all. And with mind boggling finesse. Amidst freezing cold
temperatures and fighting constant hypothermia. His struggle shows on
the screen (in a good way of course). He speaks lesser dialogues than
he ever has and that too in a husky voice, but expresses more than
ever.Leo's scintillating performance takes the survival turned revenge drama
to an all new level of immensity. Without him, the film could have been
just another visually appeasing film. Leonardo turns it into something
else. You live with him throughout the length of the film, almost
holding your own body at times to check if it hurts. As Hugh Glass
defies all odds in surviving the wrath of nature, DiCaprio defiles all
odds an actor could ever face. If this doesn't get him the coveted
golden statuette, nothing will. There a famous joke that someday there
will be a biopic made on how Leonardo DiCaprio never won an Oscar and
the actor playing him will win an Oscar for it. After this role, that
joke is ought to die a welcome death.The Revenant might not be Leonardo DiCaprio's best film, but Hugh Glass
is surely his best performance. It has all the ingredients the Academy
looks for in an Oscar winner for Best Actor, something which critics
have claimed he lacked all this while. (Yes even after Titantic, Catch
Me If You Can, Aviator, Blood Diamond, Departed and more recently The
Wolf of Wall Street). This year seems to be his year finally. Yes we've
said it a half a dozen times before only to be proved otherwise, but
this by far is the most realistic bet. After all the years of struggle
and disappointment, the moment when it finally happens would be quite
historic to say the least. Over to the 28th of February.

Its all about dealing with personal loss, Deception, Revenge and
finally Making peace with one self. The bear scene was so brutal yet to
real, and what needs to be pointed here is how this scene reflects
power, fear and patience. It also provides you an opportunity to
immerse to their reality: the freezing, skin peeling and pain, but most
importantly is the way it connects you to the intense emotional loss
the main character is going through. Leonardo did a good job in this
movie depending on his body language mainly after loosing his voice due
to the bear attack incident. Tom Hardy as well performed impressively
he was the love to hate character in this movie. The movie was very
well executed, the incredible soundtrack did successfully complement
the gorgeousness of the soft blue and blackish natural light.

I enjoyed this movie alright. On paper it had everything I love in a
movie: beautiful scenery, good cinematography, adventure, the theme of
man against the elements, a realistic portrayal of the fur-trading
industry, native Americans and early 19th century America, and so on.The initial Indian attack and the bear attack were the most exciting
parts of the movie. They were beautifully shot. Truly gripping. Must
see! Di Caprio is an amazing actor, and he didn't fail to disappoint
here.However, the film was a little on the slow side and it went on for a
little too long.In the end, this was really just another American chase and shootout
movie.The physical hardships that Glass went through evoked sympathy in me at
first (especially the bear attack!) but then it seemed to be endless
and this had a numbing effect on me. The phrase that came to mind was
"suffering porn". I didn't really care what happened to him in the end.
He was lucky to be alive at all.I suppose the themes included survival and fate. Not being in a
philosophical mood when I saw this film, All I got out of it was that
some people have horrible luck and yet survive it. The Job story, I
suppose. I didn't have a feeling that there was a higher purpose for
any of it.Another demerit for this movie: it didn't move me at all. There were
plenty of powerful moments that should have moved me, but it just
didn't happen.I want to give the movie 7.5. 8 feels too high, but 7 feels too low.
I'm going to give it an 8 because it was a beautifully shot movie with
many interesting aspects to it.

One has to respect Leonardo DiCaprio, whose career could have gone the
way of Ryan Reynolds or Mathew McConaughey--since repented-- cashing in
on his boyish looks with hollow romantic-comedies for half-wits.
Instead, he chooses to work with Spielberg, Mann, Mendes, Nolan,
Tarantino, and, of course, Scorsese--narrowing in on challenging, often
unlikable characters.In an astounding turn-around from last year's "Birdman," Alejandro
Inarritu takes a by-the-numbers folk song about one man's thirst for
revenge and strips it naked of all barroom romanticism. With "The
Revenant," he holds up his thumb to unrelenting nature, sees the beauty
within and begins the shaping process.The film's first victory was the decision to shoot on-location, with
natural light. While the concept might seem somewhat pretentious at
first--considering the luxuries computers afford--it pays off, creating
one of the more immersive film experiences in recent memory--and no 3D,
what do you know? No matter how advanced computer generation becomes,
you can't beat the real thing--that works with movies, Coca-Cola and
nearly everything else.I'm normally not a huge proponent for realism in films--I already know
it's fake, so just have fun with it--but "The Revenant" is the rare
case where I can't imagine the film any other way. Perhaps, it's
because much of it isn't fake. Or perhaps, it's because the story is so
naturally thin, and the realism puts a magnifying glass to the
cinematic fine print--delicate human moments--that would otherwise go
unnoticed. Yes, I think that's it.The action sequences--and they are that--are leagues above anything
seen in any superhero film, placing the audience amongst the gun-
smoke, zipping arrows and the horses who move like heavy machinery. No
better is this accomplishment signified than the already notorious
"bear scene," in which Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is eviscerated by a
grizzly. The scene is unrelenting in its brutality, the bear acting as
the physical manifestation of cruel Nature, and Glass as helpless Man,
always on the defensive. And unlike most blockbuster films, the action
has purpose and repercussions; it doesn't feel like a child playing
nonsensically with his toys--not that I don't occasionally enjoy such a
thing. One would be remiss to fail to mention DiCaprio's performance as
Glass--if ever there was a man less suited to his name. He's the kind
of actor who never goes for the admirable base hit, but spits in both
hands and points to the rafters each and every time; here is no
different. He's as raw and inexorable as the film itself. Same goes for
Tom Hardy, the villain of the piece, a man so detestable, the Indian
who scalped him changed his mind half-way through. The character had be
worried for a bit, as he comes off a tad mustache- twirling, but he
rounds out in the end."The Revenant," is a film that unfolds rather than unveils; that
reveals rather than relates; a film of driving, raw emotion.

Grisly and grizzly is written all over it. The biopic that carefully
walks on the edges of jaws of death that Glass managed to return from,
couldn't have possibly ended up being more complete and perfect."My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands." Aforesaid escapes Hikuc's mouth, a Pawnee who happens to the
protagonist amidst complete chaos. He walks in and out of his life like
a savior whose only intent seemed to resuscitate his dead and pass on
the above rad message.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a genius behind the lens. Right from the
very beginning you can't help but notice how he walks you amongst the
characters. With clean close up shots taken right next to individuals
he lets you stay with them, feel the angst, the immediate pain and
empathize. His famous long uncut shots are persistent here as well as
they complete big takes without breaking the flow. His genius can be
seen in parts where the camera swifts gorgeously between pumped-up
killing characters on the battle ground and stays on the ones living
till their death knell resounds. He even captures breath-gasps on
screen by giving a proper follow up to its characters for emphasis.Leonardo DiCaprio is downright exceptional. To say he ate real bison
liver and slept in animal carcass would be to say the least. He wears
the skin of Hugh Glass like a pro. There is a constant tension he
carries throughout the movie where his brows barely relax and rarely
speak of relief. The bear mauling bit is one jaw dropping memorable
scene that will forever haunt us in our dreams. To fight right to the
moment of being incapacitated was something he aced to perfection. The
aftermath of the attack where he loses his vocals, speaks with a
wheezing sound, hisses and coughs whilst talking, drinking and eating,
are all marvelously mastered.The Revenant reeks of heart-melting pathos. One of the saddest bits in
the flick is when Glass crawls his way to his son's cadaver. He stops
twice whilst doing so taken aback by the sight of the blood and the
corpse as he puts his head on his chest, and says:"I am not leaving you, son. I am right here." If you wish to see pain personified, behold Leo's eyes! Period. To
watch him gnaw on that Bison liver whilst knowing it was the real one,
couldn't help you feel sorry for him. To see him get under the quilts
of horse flesh naked to beat the cold and all odds, was how you would
have wanted the Glass story to be like.Watching The Revenant is like watching the enthralling head of Emmanuel
Lubezki. Tranquil frames visit one by one amidst the crawling story,
engaging you with its magnificence. Shots of winter ridden trees,
capped mountains, frozen leaves, dewed branches, bubbles of water
sluggishly moving 'neath the river, cloudy moon shots are all badass
results of Lubezki grandeur.The Revenant is an intriguing affair with nature. You behold the might
of nature in the biting cold, the hailing storm, big slaps of
relentless water that take the protagonist down (water-shot was
brilliantly taken as well) and animal savagery in the punishing snow
and feel them tingling your bones. It celebrates gore fights where
fingers get chopped off, ears plucked off, heads lanced with arrows.
Downright brutality! In all that barbarity, there is beauty lurking in
its originality. The way things happened has been given precedence.
That's what makes it special and unique. It is a cold blooded biopic,
played outrageously well by its ingenious actors.Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy can't be ignored either. He isn't all
evil, but with one knee in perversion, he could have been anyone put in
a dire situation. But he was the one insinuating trouble from the very
beginning, trying to justify his act by pointing "you blinked" and
attempting to put justice to his killing act. Tom Hardy plays John
extremely well with his brilliant accent, and thoughtful eyes that he
carries whilst giving explanations.Bridger is a character that could have been any one. So Poulter plays
him with perfection. A little kind to begin with, yet overpowered by
power. Not exactly wimpy either but a stone trampled down by
Fitzgerald, left without a choice.The music of the flick is apt. Complements the sadistic theme the flick
runs on. It is uplifting in a way, always suggestive of the imminent
revenge lurking in the corner. Screenplay is confined, but is no doubt
great.There are brilliant well-thought of parts strewn all across the movie.
Hugh's dreams are quite poetic. They are well supported by whispers and
a majestic backdrop that impart meaning. The music there too
supplements it. Little things like, a bird escaping from the heart of
Glass' wife signifies her soul leaving the body. One time when Glass is
hungry as hell, he sees a herd of deer crossing the river. He imagines
he has a rifle, points the stick at them and signals shooting them.
Such games of despair! As the movie concludes, we see the wife of Glass
conjuring him, ultimately leaving him alone yet again. It was a perfect
way to end it. A typical Inarritu finish that leaves you with
questions! The aforementioned is suggestive of how eager Glass was to
visit his wife, but he is bereft of death once again. Sheer amazeballs!

The best about this movie is the way that it shows how the characters
are feeling/thinking (even when they are not on screen), what is the
direction the story it's taking or going to take, what it's happening
at the moment (again, even not on screen) and the general atmosphere in
the different situations.This is more valuable when you realize all the factors that made this
possible, in detriment of too many unnecessary- dialogs. The montage,
sound and image are pretty well worked. Gestures, Looks, attitudes,
clothing and makeup also help a lot to achieve this.My note is not higher just because the elements I just explained are
lost a bit at some particular moments, enough to believe, like a humble
viewer, that some parts of the movie might been "better", following the
previous points, without exaggerate. My advice is to watch "The Revenant" in the best possible quality, and
with the most surrounding sound system (In the theater, perfect). I
believe that is exactly the way this movie was conceived to be seen.PS: sorry about grammatic, my native language is Spanish.

Let me start by saying that I have never heard wheezing in pain that
was so convincing that I believed it Oscar worthy. However, Leo is an
absolute genius in this picture. As my friend quipped, "I couldn't even
make my leg look that dead; how does he do it?" I can't even describe
for you how great DiCaprio's performance is in this film. I honestly
have never been on the Leo bandwagon. I think he's a great actor who
has turned in many Oscar worthy performances, however, I do not worship
the ground upon which he walks. This is not a Leo groupie lauding
unnecessary and bloated praises. This performance is genuinely one of
the best I've seen. This film generally has a small plot, which includes a lot of violence.
Frankly, I have never been accepting of these terms, but this movie
makes up for it else where. The cinematography of this is flawless. The
cut to shots are beyond genius, the camera work is brilliant, the
colors are rich, the costumes are great, the makeup is greater, and the
technicalities are perfection. Every t is crossed and every i dotted.
The film won't wow you with an incredible plot but it dives deep into
what it has and let's the visuals speak for themselves. It is an
instant masterpiece of filmmaking which turns in great performances
from two of today's top actors. I don't know whether it will pull down
a Best Picture Award from the Academy, but it doesn't need accolades
for longevity. It is genius. Innaritu has proved himself one of the
best filmmakers in the industry today. There isn't much more to say
about this movie. Go see it and you will see exactly what I mean. It is
polarizing so whether you like it or not, I think we can all admit that
it a great achievement all around.

The movie is a visual spectacle. The cinematography team definitely
deserve every award - nature was filmed so beautifully and watching it
on the big screen definitely enhanced the experience. And also, the
mesmerizing music score was fit perfectly into the movie. The action
sequences were incredibly violent and gory but still felt very
realistic. The attack scene at the beginning was filmed similar to
Birdman in that it appeared to take place all in one shot. It was very
fast-paced, gripping and horrific. But what was truly horrific was the
further-on bear attack scene that got everyone talking. You must watch
that scene to truly understand how terrifying it was. Now to the
acting, Leonardo Dicaprio yet amazes me once again in The Revenant.
Hardly any words are spoken by him, yet he keeps the audience
captivated for 2.5 hours. What was the best part of this movie was
that, as an audience member, I felt for Glass (Leo's character) in
every single scene. When he was being attacked, I watching in pain;
when he watched his son die helplessly and was betrayed, I felt angry;
when he was surviving and plotting revenge, I was rooting him on. Leo
definitely deserves the awards he's getting, not many actors can do
this. Not to mention Tom Hardy was absolutely brilliant as the
antagonist. Since coming out of the cinema hating his character, it is
evident he was completely devoted to bringing his role to life. Flawless cinematography, great direction, amazing acting... However, this movie was 2.5 hours long, with hardly any dialogue. I
believe if the movie was half an hour shorter, it would be a much
better movie since the changes of pace were drastic. The beginning was
great with the attack, followed by a gruesome bear attack, and
deception between the characters. As well as the ending, with an
extremely tense final shoot off between the two main characters. But
then, in between the two, there was what felt like an hour and a half
of extreme weather survival and wandering through the snowy forests. I
mean, I wasn't bored, it didn't feel dragged and it wasn't too slow
thanks to Leo's performance, it was just a lot less exciting in
comparison to the beginning and the end. And I would have liked to seen
more of that. Another problem was that this was unrealistic in the
state Glass was in - first ripped to shreds by a bear, then surviving
extreme freezing temperatures on his own, floating in cold waters,
falling from a cliff and landing in a tree... It's just not believable.
For a movie that has been created so realistically, his journey through
the cold was perhaps too much. Too long, unlikely situations...In conclusion, it's a visually stunning movie with captivating
performances. I felt for Glass completely, the action sequences were
gruesome, intense and very thrilling. I would have definitely liked to
have seen more of those scenes, as well as less extreme weather
survival in order to make the film better paced. I have rated this
therefore a 7/10. Although this movie may not be for everyone, I would
definitely recommend to go watch this on the big screen. It wouldn't
feel right any other way.

Leonardo DiCaprio is primarily known for playing dashing men but this
film had him going out of his comfort zone. And do you know what? He
did a great job. I'm not a DiCaprio fan but I thought he was well cast
in this role. He played a harsh, angry man driven by a desire to
survive for his son and later a desire to avenge his death. While he
wasn't exactly a great father as shown by his rather harsh behavior
around the kid, Hugh Glass' son was his main motivation for living and
after his death, all he had left was revenge. Furthermore his harshness
towards the boy fits the nature of the film which is essentially about
survival of the fittest. Evidently Glass' son was not the fittest.The film is bleak and dark but in no way does that make it bad because
the bleak atmosphere was entirely intentional. There was also a rather
shocking amount of blood and even a brief rape scene. This is a very
masculine movie with very few women and none in a main role. The Indian
Chief was often talking about his daughter but throughout the entire
movie, she was only on screen for about five minutes which was slightly
disappointing. I liked the open ending where it implied that Glass was
dying when he saw his late wife in the snow. He claimed he felt like he
was already dead by that point so to him, killing Fitzgerald was just
tying up a loose end before his spirit could actually leave his body.I liked the subtle little touches DiCaprio added to his performance. He
had quite a few scenes where he wasn't talking so he needed to do more
than just show off his good looks. For example after he used a horse as
transport and later shelter after it died when they fell off a cliff,
he gave its body a gentle touch before he left which I interpreted as
him thanking it for keeping him alive. The harsh, wheezing voice he
used towards the end of the movie is explained by his throat injury as
well as the fact that he had no reason to talk between the time where
his Indian friend was killed and he was found by the search party.
However I wouldn't say DiCaprio was completely perfect, although he was
pretty damn close. When Glass found his son's body, I think tears would
have made his performance even stronger and even more deserving of his
BAFTA award. To be fair, he was playing the kind of man who most likely
saw tears as a sign of weakness but I would have liked to see a tiny
bit more vulnerability in this tough and harsh character. However
that's literally the only criticism I can give him. DiCaprio was still
easily great enough to show that it's not only his looks that make him
such a successful actor and I'm pleased that he finally won an award.DiCaprio carried the movie and prevented me from losing interest
despite its long running time. Tom Hardy was also good as Fitzgerald
but I was more impressed by DiCaprio because he broke out of his
typical pretty boy role and tried something different.

The Revenant is another snowy western that's come out recently, the
other being The Hateful Eight. They are very different kind of movies
though: H8 is much about killing and talking, Revenant about not dying
and not talking! Anyways, The Revenant is a good and beautiful movie that tells a story
which is interesting in a way. See, this is one of those movies in
which some character is a little evil already and only needs a tiny
push to fall to "the dark side", if you will. Same as in Saruman in
LOTR and Sgt. Barnes in Platoon. Tom Hardy does a really good job
playing a bad-ass character as usual. That character (Fitzgerald) also
loses his honor and becomes a coward...As I said, a major part of the movie is plainly about Hugh Glass trying
to live on to avenge his son. Leonardo DiCaprio acts realistically but
I'm not sure if this is the movie he should get the Oscar from. That
should've happened already. Not a single character in this movie really
does anything I could REALLY remember them from. They do what they're
supposed to but there is not much interesting dialogue like in, well
Hateful Eight for example. Instead, what we find is an amazing story of
survival, betrayal and revenge that is detached from the characters
themselves. It's quite universal.I love the cinematography here and the movie is very enjoyable to
watch, really. I long to go camping in clean and fresh forests and
mountains, drink straight from a river. Maybe I'll just pack my bags
and head for Lapland. Maybe I got a little carried away. Nice views and
excellent work there whatsoever. Finally, if there is something that bothered me during watching The
Revenant, it's the sound mixing/editing. I often felt like I was
listening to three layers of sounds and music. Even the silent parts
often had some sort of weird humming or screeching in the background.
It made me feel nervous in the bad way. The actual sounds of the movie
+ the score were enough. Someone fix that for me?8/10

If you truly appreciate movies and the art of cinematography, then this
is definitely one you should watch. Leonardo Dicaprio delivers probably his best performance to date, and
this is an actor who has 5 Oscar nominations to his name. Each
character has a strong personality in this film and Alejandro González
Iñárritu definitely brought out the best out of all them. Alejandro González Iñárritu keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat,
delivering really intense action sequences throughout, and makes you
appreciate movies a lot more.Some of the viewers might argue that the film is too long (2 Hours and
36 minutes), but the film definitely has many action and thrilling
sequences to make you forget about time.

I went to the movie theater thinking that The Revenant would be a
masterpiece, considering both its cast and trailer. The movie has a
very significant amount of violence, and might not be suitable for all
audiences. Even though it's a great movie, it has a few downs.Every actor had an outstanding performance, with Di Caprio taking the
upper hand. With that in mind, I believe that his Oscar is well
deserved (which he should've won in The Wolf of Wall Street, by the
way). Although the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat most of the
time, the movie is very slow and doesn't seem to move forward which,
combined with its cliché plot, makes it a bit boring sometimes. Not to
mention that it's a very long movie (2h36min) that should have had a
wider story to work with.In my opinion, The Revenant deserves a 7/10 for the cast's performance
and a few gore scenes that exceeded many levels.

Let us begin with what makes this movie a good one. Unlike many films,
'The Revenant' depends almost exclusively on the vision of the
director. 'Revenant' does not rely on a complex story to touch its
audience, it does so through a near-flawless execution of the limited
material it had to work on. It is easy to see that Iñáritu has had to
dig deep in his artistic mind to make up for a rather unimpressive
screenplay, for the movie contains an incredible amount of description
and very little narration, which basically renders the plot non- active
for the majority of the movie. Iñáritu has been able to make an
otherwise dull story an interesting one where, consciously or not, the
audience suffers alongside the character of Hugh Glass, the audience
wants him to attain his goal and where the audience wants to see how
this will all end. Through visual metaphors and imagery, the director
has been able to create interest in the story and character although,
in the end, many, but not all, of his artistic pieces are not given
further development. This, in turn, can lead to the issue of style over
substance. True, the style is what makes this movie a success but there
were certain scenes which I really believed were unnecessary and
pointless since they did not quite serve any purpose at all. All I can
think of is that they were an attempt at providing character
development for Glass or perhaps, they were a device that should have
made the audience sympathise more with the character but ultimately,
they simply left a bitter after taste of incomprehension. Mark L. Smith
shined at providing a believable and engrossing setting for the epic
tale but his job stopped there. The time he wasted at wording
unnecessary artistic scenes, could have easily been used at many
instances to give Glass a few moments that would have greatly helped to
develop the character. As a matter of fact, they did a better job at
developing most of the other characters than they did for the lead one,
which is truly a shame. With DiCaprio bringing in his talent, they
could have done so much more but oh well Next in line is, of course, Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. Well,
there really aren't many things to say about Chivo's work. It was a
good cinematography. Don't mistake me. There were scenes where it truly
was an incredible work to achieve on camera. The handwork alone simply
grasped the audience into a natural frenzy and never let go for a
single second while they were other scenes which settings were so
perfectly designed and filmed that they warmed your heart just enough
not to let you die in this frozen wilderness. But unlike
cinematographers like Roger Deakins or Dariusz Wolski where the
audience is fully aware of the aesthetic beauty of each and every
single shot, Lubezki's photography is more about capturing the feeling
of the setting and trying to bring the audience as close to the real
thing as is possible, such that you feel transported when you watch
'The Revenant'. And as is the case most of the time, when you are in
the middle of something, you often fail to notice just how beautiful it
might seem to those who aren't. But all in all, I expected nothing less
from the man. He was top notch, as always.And now the acting. Tom Hardy did a brilliant job at portraying a
despicable human being but to be honest, that was not his best work. He
did the best he could with the little he had, of course, and for that,
he deserves acclaim. And finally, the man DiCaprio. I often say that
DiCaprio's best work, in my opinion, is in 'Blood Diamond' and that was
because he simply owned every aspect of the character, making him
believable while managing to retain what is needed for him to be a
fiction character. With 'Revenant' DiCaprio impersonates Hugh Glass. He
gives himself to his maximum, compromising on everything so as to give
one of the most authentic of performances ever. Perhaps, one of the
most visceral and marking performances in the history of Hollywood
cinema. Where he sometimes fails is where the screenplay fails and
therefore through no fault of his own. It is true that, at many
specific instances, I found myself holding my breath or wincing, while
watching the hardship through which his character had to go through and
his performance is what makes such a level of empathy possible but on
the other hand, there was no real connection with the character. Yes,
he wanted revenge and us, as the audience, we know that, but the
screenplay lacked the little details that make us really care for him.
I found myself watching the movie till the end mostly out of curiosity
and out of admiration of DiCaprio's work than out of real care about
what is going to happen in the end. Again, as I already mentioned
before, my problem is with the screenplay which, I believe, is the
weakest element of the movie. Ultimately, I cannot say that 'The
Revenant' was a disappointment. Sure, while I had greater expectations
for certain things, I was still pleasantly surprised by others. And
there were a few elements that I was already certain would hit the
bull's eye and they did just that. Taking into account everything I've
written about, I definitely recommend the movie as a cinematic
experience that mostly would appeal to enthusiasts and, therefore, may
not be suited for all types of audience. So, if I had to sum up what
'The Revenant' stands for me, it would be actually pretty easy. 'The
Revenant' is visual poetry. Nothing less, but also, nothing more.

I'm NOT a big LDC fan, although I do have to admit he's skilled.
Gripping movie to the last, though a bit unrealistic surviving that
bear attack. Infection alone would have taken him, and he would have
never used either hand again. A bear that large pouncing on a man again
and again... and returning for more, would have shattered his entire
rib cage, and burst all of his organs, and I'd think it would have
taken at least one bite out of him, and/or finished mauling him while
her cubs were within shouting distance. I guess a little mud and some
native American chanting, and of course a little peyote was enough to
give him the constitution of Superman. Second best bear attack on film,
see the best one, Backcountry, and you'll have nightmares for years.Brutal attacks ofKeep working Leo, someday I'll be a fan.

This is a movie that really made a lot of noises and is still making,
with an Oscar winner director, an amassing cast with DiCaprio ahead of
it and else. The cinematography is amassing, the soundtrack is really
good as well as screenplay and everything else that cineasts do which
I'm not mentioning, but one thing I don't get from this movie. What are
makers thinking with this ordinary story. A very low rhythm, boring I
can say in some scenes and completely exaggerated. This movie may win a
lot of Oscars but I don't believe that the best motion picture of 2015
will go for him, if it goes I don't know they will be making a big
mistake. For tow things this movie will be remembered in years one is
the bear scene and the other is the horse scene. Overall good movie but
not something super deep or touching, I recommend to everyone to see it
for the cinematographic aspect, because is really amassing.

Good movie. The (Canadian?) backdrop was both authentic and
spectacular.Lennie the Goat hammed it up as usual - I can never seem to take him
seriously - but fair play to him for freezing for his art. Tom Hardy
was mumbingly miscast as the bad guy trapper and went way down in my
estimation. No one else took the eye - probably because they were all
trying to keep warm. But this is to miss the point - this movie was about the story and the
wilderness setting, not the acting. Much has been said about the
violence and gore. There were horse-guts loads of both and a lot of
effort was put into making us all look away from the screen at certain
moments. Most of the horrifying bits made me laugh out loud because
they were over - contrived. The famed bear scene, although reasonably
well done, was a hoot.All in all, worth going to see unless you're squeamish about not-real
blood and guts.

I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and i find most of his work
impressive. This movie is one more addition to the great work that he's
done. The movie is about the suffering/revenge journey of a
frontiersman who fights for survival after a bear attack and the death
of his son by a member of his hunting team. The story is great and the
overall acting of Leo is great as well but the movie is a bit boring. I
believe the movie needed to have a faster pace. Also, Tom Hardy did an
outstanding performance that to my opinion made him outperform Leo at
least in this movie. Don't get me wrong, i am a big fan of Leo as i
mentioned before but i believe his acting was a bit exaggerated and Tom
was slightly better. Again, the movie is great but it needed faster
pace and less exaggerated acing.

I don't know if I've ever wished for a movie to end so many times that
I enjoyed as much as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's newest outing The
Revenant (2015). Fresh off an Oscar with Birdman (2014), Inarritu
continues his trend of a natural unstoppable force constantly pressing
throughout his films. A force so strong that it won't even allow us to
breathe. It is also worth mentioning the progression from Birdman, a
dark comedy mostly centered around the ways which we present ourselves
to others, and The Revenant, which replaces all of the dialogue in
Birdman with brutal moment after brutal moment.The films structure calls to mind thoughts of Gravity (Cuaron, 2013)
lying mostly on its protagonist dealing with just about every single
thing that could go wrong going wrong, initiating with the now infamous
bear scene. While Gravity seemed to replace interesting story telling
with these humongous set pieces, The Revenant uses these constant
natural disasters to help supplement the spiritual journey that Glass
(Leonardo DiCaprio) endeavors. In an interview with Variety, the film's
director spoke heavily about the two tiers that the story revolves
around.Being both beautiful and completely brutal, this film will rip into
your mind and leave you with mental and emotional scars all too similar
to that of the main character. Inarritu collaborates again with Birdman
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who once again has proved he is an
absolute geniuses with the camera. Whether he is a 'mad' genius is up
for debate. The themes of the unbreakable human spirit in the film seem
to mirror the production perfectly. Shot in entirely natural light,
sometimes only shooting for an hour a day to find the perfect light,
the film went through tremendous difficulties to perfect Lubezki and
Inarritu's vision, and it pays off marvelously .While the image is completely breathtaking, The Revenant seems to have
its weakest aspect lying within the screenplay itself. I by no means am
saying that having little dialogue hurts the film in any way, in fact
it enhances it, but when there is so little dialogue when it arrives it
needs to be cutting and important, and most importantly interesting.
Now the dialogue by no means is boring, but it does not reach the same
peaks as the technical aspects of this film.As relentless as this film is, it seems as if this was an earlier cut
of the film. By that, I mean that it seemed as though there was still
needless moments that only heightened tension for a moment but ended up
not contributing to the overall necessity of the movie. I never got
bored, but there were certainly moments where I thought to myself
'alright, this needs to pick up the pace!' When every minute feels like
three, because the pain is so real, it's hard to sit through any
moments that seem redundant.The Revenant is brutal, gut wrenching, and painful, yet beautiful and
endearing. It was probably the most visceral film of the 2015 season.

*This of course contains spoilers. (Also probably better reviews than
mine but who cares.)The Revenant was as intense in some moments as it was beautiful. The
cinematography, to the sound, editing, acting, everything, was perfect.
I didn't give it a 10/10 because the very end was false but changing
the script to satisfy the story was in correct direction in my opinion. You start off with a single shot scene that carries on for I'm guessing
ten minutes or so but without paying attention to the details, you
would never realize; it's very similar to the way Alfonso Cuarón does
his films. Some of the camera work of the low angle shots and
transitions really made it breath to where you actually are a bit
frightened during the scene, more so than some crappy horror flick.There's not much to say about the acting other than what everyone
already knows through social media.I personally heard it through
internet, word of mouth, and on TV but I wanted to see it because hey,
Leo and Tom together in one movie? Duh. The film was delayed due to weather by a full three months I believe so
Tom Hardy missed out on Suicide Squad to do this film so you know it
has to be good. Even in an evil role you can't not love the great Tom
Hardy. He's one of the most captivating actors of his time. He has a
scene talking about his father and God which(watch the movie) He makes
into a mockery of God through a joke from his father and then stares in
silence where you're forced to look into his eyes. It's a very eerie
moment but in a good way. He is of course the actor that acted mostly
using his eyes for an entire film. - The Dark Knight Rises.As for the social media and what not about Leonardo DiCaprio winning
his first Oscar kind of speaks for itself. Everyone knows how amazing
he is in everything he does an the lengths he goes to. Fun fact:
Leonardo is a vegetarian in real life and in the film he ate a raw
liver; as you see him eat the liver in the film, he is actually eating
it for real. Which for me(know before I saw the film) made me laugh
because I'm immature but immediately vomits after the first bite, know
that was real just made me crack up. Anyways, Leo is king.Again, there are better reviews than this one but hey it was fun. All
in all, the film was pretty incredible and was absolutely better in
theaters. Go see it.

**No spoilers**Whoooooowee! What a great film! This is one of the rare excellent
movies that in my opinion, you only need to see once. The only other
film that left me with this type of impression was The Passion of the
Christ.This movie is emotionally and physically draining. Just watching a man
get the hell beat out of him at ever turn is surprisingly tiring to
watch. The message of this movie is quite simple: The power of
vengeance to fuel a man's will to survive. By the time you leave the
theater, you just want to sit by a fire and sip some hot cocoa. The visuals are stunning. Panoramic nature shots, gripping close ups,
computer graphics (The bear), and everything in between was
fantastically done. The opening scene alone is quite literally THE BEST
choreographed and shot battle scene I have ever seen. You can tell that DiCaprio, Hardy, the supporting actors, and the crew
went through absolute HELL to make this movie and it is definitely
worth watching.

Having just watched Iñárritu previous and fantastic movie Birdman
again, and knowing this film was nominated for 12 Oscars my
expectations was very high, despite the fact that the trailer made the
movie look boring. I thought it was just a bad trailer. But no; this
long long movie is boring from start to finish, and when the movie ends
I could not care less who lived or died, so even in the grand finale I
did not really care how the movie ended. I'm so disappointed. I really
hope it will not get any Oscars, and feel so sad that a great actor
like DiCaprio probably receives an Oscar for a part, where most of his
lines are grunts, instead of for one of the many great movies he has
made prior to this one. But I guess he will win because he deserved to
have an Oscar already, and this is how the Oscar often goes when great
actors have been overlooked.

I used to live in Northern Canada so I definitely enjoyed the visuals
in the movie but even that pleasure was lessened by inconsistencies.
One minute DiCaprio was walking on flat land with no mountains even in
the distance and then boom he was in the mountains. Unless two weeks
had passed that could not have happened. The story line was incredibly
weak, just too many coincidences and inconsistencies. Even to the James
Bond style of leaving the hero almost dead but without finishing the
job. We have to be able to suspend disbelief to enjoy a movie but it
was very difficult to do that with such a weak story line. It was
nicely filmed and there was some stunning scenery but that could not
compensate for the weak script.

The Revenant is a really well made film. Almost every shot is flawless,
the acting is brilliant, the dialogue is great - you have to start
nitpicking to find things to critique. Yes, you can see that they have
used CGI a couple of times, but it still works really well. The movie
is a bit long, but I never lost interest in it.The story is at its surface a classical western, almost. Revenge,
kinship, man versus nature, and so on. To me, the most interesting part
about the movie was how it explored man as animals. You see the
settlers looking at the natives as savages, and you also see the
settlers acting like savages in front of the natives. If anything, this
movie shows how cruel life can be, and how bad circumstances can bring
out the worst in people. On the surface, there is a "good" and an
"evil" side of this story, and the villain of the story is at times
cruel. But at the heart of the conflict is the will to survive, at any
cost. Humans are animals. The natives know this, and thus are more in
peace with the horrible conditions. The settlers struggle with this,
and thus turn into savages.

The Revenant is a cinematic journey, depicting the lengths a father
will go to avenge the death of his son.Every second of the films 2 1/2 hour runtime was felt, leaving me with
a feeling of accomplishment as I left the theatre and begin to
contemplate what I saw on my travelsLeo is great as usual, pulling off a performance you would expect but
having to go through hell and back to achieve it. Acting as a whole was
fine but I'm left asking myself one question.... What the f did Tom
Hardy say in this movie? Although the actor has a number of accents up
his sleeve, this one just left me scratching my head as he seemingly
impersonates Jeff Bridges in cowboy roles.The film is intense, brutal, barbaric and at times hard to watch which
is exactly what was the aim and reflects both the true story of which
the film is based as well as the story behind this films making.For me the Revenant is a well acted, well directed film with brilliant
cinematography with a daring choice of only natural lighting
throughout. With the Oscars fast approaching I wouldn't be surprised if
the film came back with a few awards(LEO FINALLY), even if Best
Production design is laughable, the film is well made across the board
and has the nominations to prove it.

A first impression makes me wonder: is it 12 nominations? Is it best
picture or director? I think that many nominations ... but it certainly
is a flawless film (Iñárritu could win best director again) but would
not be among my favorite classic or. I did not see her again.The photograph really liked it, looks like a documentary Natgeo; and
all this combined with the frame and with two great performances (Di
Caprio and Tom Hardy) makes us feel the freezing cold. Both actors
would give the Oscar, although I have not seen all the other nominees.
Di Caprio as an actor conveys the desire to survive in the worst
conditions as described by the myth of Hugh Glass.I applaud the perception that conveys on indigenous. relatively leaving
the politically correct indigenous: Dances with Wolves (1990), and
assumes the historical reality of being a world in constant conflict
between tribes which intensified with the progress (accompanied by
genocide suffered) from the white and the State . It is a story of
"frontier" of the United States in 1823, of that world that pits men
over land and resources, but also for the honor and survival.

I haven't seen one review that mentions that this movie is a remake of
"Man in the Wilderness (1971)" which starred Richard Harris and John
Huston! It is an overdone remake at that, considering that it's running
time of 2h 36min is 52 minutes longer than the original movie! And
don't you just love these so-called reviewers who blather on about the
Producers, Directors, Actors, Cinematography and on and on...??? OK so
the movie has made $14 million over it's budget of $135 million but in
todays market that doesn't pay for half of the cost for advertising it!
At last i'm nearing the 10 line minimum to post this thing, so I will
finish this by recommending that all movie-goers watch the "original"
movie first! Semper Fi...

I tend to appreciate Alejandro G. Iñárritu and I have begun to notice
Leonardo DiCaprio's strengths, but I am pretty sure that without vast
advertising and multiple wins and nominations I would have postponed
The Revenant for much later. But now I have seen it and I cannot say it
was boring or disappointing... but no wow! either.Apparently there are still more elements I liked: direction,
cinematography, magnificently created scenes (e.g. fighting with bear,
riding into the ravine), two eminent performances (DiCaprio and Mother
Nature - yes, nature here was no supporting actor, but a leading one),
wide use of non-US actors (seemed that US ones were in minority), but
its sparse plot stretched into almost 2.5 hours and long staying on
violent scenes diminished the total value for me, I felt sometimes that
I was watching Discovery channel... Plus the thing that some actors
were so "defaced" that they were difficult to recognize, Thomas Hardy
included; well, the latter is a good actor, but I am a bit hesitant
regarding his Oscar nomination for his John Fitzgerald.All in all, Mr. Iñárritu and others knew how and managed to do well,
but it is hardly a movie you would multiple times, unless you
masochistically try to feel "abandoned but wild" while sitting in the
warmth on the sofa and ponder on and over how one could survive in the
1st half of 19th century when eating raw fish was not eating sushi and
raw meat was no Boeuf a la tartar...

There has been a lot of hype about this film with much talk of Leonardo
DiCaprio's dedication to his performance, and the brilliant Tom Hardy
lined up next to him it certainly sounded like it was going to be an
epic and epic it was, in a few different ways.The moment the film starts you're taken back to the early 1800's in the
cold and desolate landscape of Montana and South Dakota with
breathtakingly gorgeous scenery and an almost endless vista. You can
literally feel the coldness oozing out of the screen. Long lingering
shots are plentiful, with a slow and powerful soundtrack combining to
make the films overall pace seem somewhat sluggish at times (with a 2hr
36min running time it could have been comfortably shorter). Putting
that aside the story does tick along and there are plenty of tense
scenes which keep you on edge and focused.The gore though, wow there is a LOT of gore in this film. Whilst I'm
sure it's very realistic it can't be described as anything other than
brutal. Some scenes are literally a brutal onslaught and are often
difficult to stomach, not what I was expecting. The cast were first
class, DiCaprio immersing himself in the role to an incredible level
whilst Hardy playing his slightly crazed character in that incredibly
satisfying way only Hardy can. The two of them work together perfectly.Up for many Oscars this film is certainly worth of the nominations,
this is one well worth seeing but just be aware of its stark brutality.

The Revenant is a modern visual masterpiece. A poetic beauty of nature
marked by the ugly human violence imposed upon it. And while the
struggle of a man trying to avenge his murdered son seems to be a
simple plot, Iñárritu made it sure that it is a transportive experience
like no other. The director's fascination of long shots and complex
camera work are well presented here (quite often so), and the
undeniably outstanding work of Lubezki's cinematography will not stop
him from getting that well-deserved Oscar three-peat comes Hollywood's
biggest night.Full review: http://notimeforbadfilms.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-

I would have almost walked out of the movie, if i hadn't gone into the
theatre with my friends. Nominated for many Oscars, viral discussions
about the movie in the social media and a huge hype everywhere. I had
high expextations but the movie couldn't meet them.There is no story, it is only about revange in the North American
wilderness. There is pointless violence, lot's of moaning and groaning,
blood and plenty of unrealistic szense and story lines that do not make
sense. When Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is attacked by a bear, he has
injuries that no human would have ever survived. In one second he is
almost diying, in the other second he is swimming, talking and hunting.
These ambivallece of a men whi is almost dead and then absoluetly fine
again did not make sense for me. Falling from cliffs without injury,
getting stiched together without any affect on the well being was to
extreme for me. The biggest mistakes are for me the ending, where two
men alone hunt down a criminal. The way that is being done was non
sense. A day before Hugh Glass wasn't able to walk, the next day he is
ready to hunt someone and win. ALso the day before tons of men search
for Hugh Glass, the next day two men alone walk out and follow a
criminal. In the very end Hugh Grant leaves the criminal for the native
indians. For what reason? for me this is one of the most overrated
movies ever. I would not watch it again.

When Alejandro González Iñárritu directed Birdman last year, he showed
to moviegoers that he was a very talented filmmaker. That movie had so
much art in it and it was quite a mind-blowing masterpiece. When I
heard that he was directing this movie, it made me wonder: What is he
going to do to impress us this time? The trailer for this movie looked
amazing so I was very excited to see this movie. My anticipation
definitely paid off for this movie and I loved every bit of it.A frontiersman named Hugh Glass is on a fur-trapping expedition deep in
the forests of a territory of the Louisiana Purchase. After he is
mauled by a bear, he is left for dead. He barely survives the attack
and he sets out on a path of vengeance for the man who left him for
dead.Emmanuel Lubezki is my favorite movie cinematographer. He has shot so
many amazing movies and he puts a ton of effort into all of his work.
The cinematography in this movie is also very great. The outdoor
landscapes are beautiful and majestic to look at. The scenes in the
forest and the snowy landscapes are breathtaking as well. Like "Tree of
Life", all of the scenes in this film were only shot in natural light.
I could definitely see this movie winning an Oscar for Best
Cinematography.Hugh Glass goes through a lot in this movie. He narrowly avoids getting
killed by Indians, he is mauled by a bear and suffers from the damages
days afterwards, he is forced to watch as someone (I'm not going to
spoil and say who) dies while he is unable to help him, he falls off a
waterfall in a desperate attempt to escape Indians, a horse he is
riding falls off a cliff with him on it in an attempt to escape
enemies, and so much more. His character is really beaten up throughout
the movie and he has to do a lot of intense things to stay alive. As
the viewer, you cannot help but feel sorry for him for all that he went
through. This is one of the few movies which doesn't need to provide
character development as it is able to provide something which
distracts you from it.The action in this movie is actually pretty impressive. Its use of long
takes, expertise cuts and camera angles, and great visuals makes each
of them stand out. When I first watched the movie, I was a little
worried that it wasn't going to live up to my expectations, but I no
longer felt that after the first 15 minutes of the movie. The fighting
scene near the beginning was definitely the best one in this film. It
did a great job at getting me into the movie. It was very impressive
because it used many different camera techniques to make it always feel
original from beginning to end. It was a great way to start the film.
Also, all of the other action scenes are pretty good as well.Another big accomplishment in this film was that it depicted the
characters, not as villains, but as another species trying to do
whatever it takes to survive in the harsh environment. Their decisions
and actions in the film aren't really guided on hatred and insecurity
as much as they are guided on fearing what will happen to them if they
don't do what they do. The final fight in the film gives us another
viewpoint on the movie and it makes us speculate if Glass fighting
Fitzgerald to the death is really worth it. Most of the violence from
the movie comes as a result of self-defense. Even the character that
comes closest to feeling like a villain (John Fitzgerald) is driven by
fear rather than by hate. Also, the bear attack scene was the most
realistic and intense animal attack I've ever seen in a movie and I
don't think that it will be outdone for a very long time.The acting is really great. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy do great
jobs as the 2 main leads. There is actually very little dialogue spoken
in the film. For most of the movie, the viewer becomes use to the
environment and the viewer experiences what the characters are going
through just by their facial expressions. Leonardo DiCaprio barely
speaks anything in the entire middle section of the film. However, his
performance is great just by his facial expressions. He shows to us how
much pain his character is in and he is able to do it so great without
saying much lines of dialogue. Hopefully, he finally gets an Oscar this
year because that Oscar he has deserved for all of these years is long
overdue. There is something about Tom Hardy's performance that I like
so much, and I sometimes have a hard time explaining what it is. I feel
that it has something to do with how his tone of voice. Every time when
he opens his mouth, he always interests me and I become drawn to his
performance. Both of them have a pretty good chance at winning an Oscar
and I think that they both did the best this year by far.In conclusion, this movie is a visual masterpiece which has very
interesting characters and intelligent action scenes. With all the
praise I gave it in this review, it is not perfect because I feel that
the middle of it could have had at least 15-20 minutes cut off of it,
but that's my only complaint. Make sure you watch this film because you
will definitely not be disappointed.

--There are no spoilers in this review-- Im writing this review for one specific reason: I want viewers to know
what they're getting into. Im gonna start this off by saying if you
haven't already watched the trailer, do yourself a favor and don't
watch it. I feel like the trailer is kind of misleading. At least it
was for me. The trailer made the movie seem like a very action packed
movie. If someone explains this movie to you as an epic revenge tale,
don't listen to them. Yes, there are some very good (and beautifully
shot) fight/action scenes in here, but it's not what drives the movie.
This movie is a very realistic survivor story. Probably the best
survivor story i've ever seen. It is full of great performances.
Leonardo DiCaprio was great in the movie. He doesn't have very much
dialogue, his acting is very physical. But that actually just made his
performance even more impressive. Will Poulter was also good in the
movie, but for me Tom Hardy was the scene stealer. Evey scene Tom Hardy
was in was in my opinion great. And I also think he was the best and
most interesting character in the movie. This movie is also one of the, if not the best shot movie I have ever
seen. You may have heard by now that the director shot this movie in
entirely in natural light. And it really payed off. Also the shots in
this movie goes on for a long time. There aren't very many cuts which
was very cool and impressive to see. Like I said: this is probably the
best shot and one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.If you're a lover of cinema you've probably already seen this movie, if
not why are you still reading this review? Go see it! And if you're
just a casual movie viewer you'll probably also like this movie. You
just have to know what you're getting into which is: A very realistic
survivor story with great acting and great visuals.Rating: 8/10

The cinematography is amazing. Stunning. Beautiful. The battle scenes
are incredible. The plot is strange, fragmented and didn't really work
for me after reading the book. I felt like this was a wish mash of
films and genres squashed into 2.5 hours. It felt like a homage to
Dancing with the Wolves, Rambo, and pretty much any other
wilderness/survival story that includes the moral dilemma of what to do
if someone is injured and you are isolated in the middle of nowhere.I found many parts of the film were unnecessary, and can't understand
why the screen writers took such a large leap away from the Michael
Punke novel (who also took some artistic licence with the original Hugh
Glass story.) Hugh Glass never had a son or native America wife - this,
for me, added nothing to the story but to give Leo the bitter
motivation to hunt down Fitzgerald. I think they should have emphasised
just how isolated and dangerous a world the fur trappers lived in, they
were exploring the unknown wilderness of the eastern edge of the
rockies, 300 miles from the nearest fort. He was attacked by a bear,
and they did leave him for dead - as they were attacked by Indian's
while waiting for him to die. This was another aspect of the story left
out, just how dangerous the native Americans were. The filmmakers could
have created a very tense atmosphere based on the prospect of Glass
running into them at anytime (like he did.) They never emphasised how
leaving him without his rifle, and most of his equipment was a death
sentence in that environment. The book really shows the reader how the
basic survival equipment and weapons each man carried were invaluable.
This is what really annoyed glass, was he wasn't left with any of it.
Making his survival all the more remarkable.The french 'trappers' or soldiers were not needed in the story (they
weren't in the original.) Neither were the roving band of natives
looking for a stolen girl. They're were plenty of different native
American tribes in that area, some friendly and most not. In the book,
every time he meets a native American you have the nervous tension
feeling wondering if they'll kill him or help him. Also, with the
different band of characters quite regularly and often bumping into
each other, you get the impression the journey spanned a relatively
small area packed with people. In reality Glass travelled 300 miles
alone south, while the trappers north. He then follows their footsteps,
and faces many dangers along the way.I watched the movie mesmerised by the cinematography and landscapes.
But I never engaged with the characters. I didn't really feel much for
glass, nor felt any emotions when he lost his son. The french were
disliked, but so were the Indian's trying to find the missing daughter.
I didn't really feel like vengeance was served when Fitzgerald meets
glass. Amazing cinematography but flawed story and unoriginal. w

The film is not as hunky-dory as it is cracked up to be. On the one
hand the storyline is played out as agonizingly and painfully slow as
all the excruciating and unbearable pain that the seemingly
indestructible Leonardo DiCaprio has to put up with throughout the
entire film. His relentless suffering together with the nudity scenes
in those freezing temperatures are simply beyond credibility. At some
point I thought DiCaprio had been graciously touched by some
immortality Indian spell because nobody could have been able to endure
such agony. One gut-wrenching scene they could easily have done without
is that of the horse plunging with DiCaprio on top over the ravine.
That was totally unreal. In my opinion DiCaprio doesn't rightfully
deserve the Oscar for best actor for this film because rather than
speaking he seems to do nothing but groan and moan throughout the whole
film. On the other hand I also found the music deadly dull as it didn't
help me submerge myself in the film if this had been at least more
engaging. It's also worth mentioning that Tom Hardy could have
pronounced his lines more articulately and clearly. There were parts of
his speech that I had difficulty understanding. The Revenant is one of those films I wouldn't put myself to the torture
of watching it again when it comes out on DVD, not even to understand
Tom Hardy's lines with the aid of the subtitles. It left me unimpressed
and what's more it hugely disappointed the great expectations I had
built up for this film.

Reaction from someone who is both nutty about photography and survival
techniques: (Or - Things I didn't like and which broke the movie for
me) - Use of a fish eye lens in certain places. The distortions in the
visuals broke the illusion.- Repeatedly letting the lens get dirty or foggy, or wet, or snowy.
Broke the illusion.- Lens glare, lens flare and star flares, broke the illusion.Those things were put in I guess to make the movie feel more artsy but
it backfired for me.Also, I know that the main character was a pretty tough guy, but I
can't help but notice that many of the survival techniques were
portrayed cheaply. At one point when a fire was made, you could see
clearly that the fire wasn't sparked by the flint and steel (as hardly
anything was coming off it), but smoke and ember came from outside the
camera's viewpoint, and created that first flame. If you insist on
showing survival in such detail, then at least get it right, or pretend
you get it right and cut to where there is already a fire. But don't
base what you show on something you've seen on Discovery in 3 episodes
of Bear Grylls' survival fairytale and assume you know how to do it.
There were a few such instances where survival scenes were shown in
great detail. The scenes would have been awesome, if the director would
have gone that extra little step to make it full out real-looking, not
just mimicry of something on TV and then not actually getting the
mechanics of it right. It would not really have been hard to make it
good, if the director had really understood what he was doing, or what
he was asking for. They would have spent maybe a few more hours on
recording the movie in total, but made a big difference in how the
survival stuff was portrayed.Besides, since he would have died of hypothermia 5-7 times in the movie
already the scene reminiscent of "The Empire Strikes Back", was
unnecessary and too much. He could have just as well just curled up
under that tree and been fine (since he had been so many times before
already).Lastly, when you have an axe and supposedly know how to use it... (or
did he not? He missed the first hit when trying to cut that branch, I
never miss like that myself and use an axe maybe twice a year.) ...
then how can you be so silly as to not use the reach of it against a
knife fighter? That broke it for me further.All that gave the movie its 5 points for me was the acting of the main
actors, actually all actors. The acting was superb and saved what was
left for me in the movie, kept me watching. So all applause goes to the
actors who did an awesome job, but I'm not impressed of the
storytelling by the director, neither the cinematography.

I enjoyed this movie, even though at times it was slow (but not
terribly slow). As most people here, I also expected more, but if you
only expect an action movie, you will not be disappointed. Other than
well directed action scenes and nice, occasionally beautiful scenery,
the movie has nothing else to offer. Di Caprio is plain average,
scenario doesn't always make much sense (Di Caprio laughing with old
Indian only days after his son was killed), Tom Hardy played his part
good, there is no climax to the story as it goes towards the end, there
is no "message", no "higher cause", nothing of artistic value.But still, as I said, if you think of Revenant only as of an action
movie, you won't be disappointed (well, not too much).

Visiting the Pacific Northwest has kinda been on my bucket list, and
this film just saved me using miles on my American Airlines'
AAdvantange card, but that's the good news... Sadly, this film borrows
too much from the equations of Saving Private Ryan, extraordinary
opening battle scene, but really, Gladiator with snow, where the wife
and son flashbacks were way too similar and predictable. I barely heard
the dialogue, whether it was poor recording of the audio during the
shoot or the theater's sound system. (I resorted to reading the
characters' lips.) Inasmuch as I wanted to believe the story, a bear
attack of such magnitude, open wounds, loss of blood, albeit modern day
medical care, and recovering with such ability, killed its credibility.
Les Stroud and Bear Grylls would cringe regarding hypothermia's effects
while swimming in subzero waters, wearing soaked garments, without
succumbing, nearly had me walk out of the theater. Overall, the film
should win an Oscar for cinematography, as well as a camera operator
who handled a Steadicam quite well. If anything, the film makes me long
for The Wolf of Wall Street II.

I came to the theater with so much expectation, because well,
Internationally, It gets very high rating in many website. I should
have learn my lesson. Sometimes several movie critics is just a bit
clueless what it makes a good script. The camera work is outstanding I
will give you that. But Masterpiece? You must be kidding. This Movie
lack so many key aspect and element that makes a movie a masterpiece.
The main element is a good script. Too much style, but little substance. The first act already have amazing setup and build each character
nicely that makes us rooting for the hero and the rest. but the
screenwriter somehow lost the plot at the second act (just like many
other with not so good script has suffered), too many filler scene (the
same circumstance keep showing. lazy writing) and Leonardo Dicaprio
character become the most center character and we hardly see others
character development (in which Leonardo Dicaprio's gain because it
showcase his acting talent). This movie can scrapped into 1 hours movie
and it won't lost the main narrative, that's how bad the writers has
waste his 2 hours 30 min to make a movie more meaningful. I will give the show credit for make the movie watchable just for the
real setup that it's really look too real at the beginning of the movie
(well, the writers really lost the plot because it's become ridiculous
the more you watch it). If Only it can handle with a more capable
screenwriters. such a shame. But Nice try by the way.

This movie was shot with a very good camera. You can tell by watching
the lingering shots of trees. It's got good low light sensitivity as
you can tell by certain night time shots.The revenant has a slick surface. But what's underneath it in the end?
It's a story about a man who sets out to enact his revenge on a "bad
guy". There's a "bad guy" in this movie who does bad things and this
movie's main character wants revenge which he gets in the end. But what
does this story show us? What can we see in it? What can we learn from
it?We can see a lot of nasty, uncomfortable stuff. Like a rapist getting
his penis cut off. That shows him, right? If he didn't want that, he
shouldn't have raped that woman. Just desserts! It's that kind of
mentality that this film has and it's rather stupid.There are some cliché lines like "Revenge won't bring your murdered son
back" as well as the most problematic one namely "Revenge should be
dished out by God". That last one is just irresponsible in this day and
age where in the real world people actually go on killing sprees
because they think "God must dish out revenge". The movie just wants to
sound more sophisticated and deep than it actually is by having those
lines in its script but it just makes it sound more stupid and empty.
The movie has nothing to say.We can't learn anything from this flick. Other than that they make good
cameras nowadays and there's no shortage of daft screenplays. No amount
of impressive camera work will save a movie if the script is no good.
And this movie's script is terrible.

I just got back from seeing this movie tonight (that statement will
probably date this review quite severely before long), and I must say
it's quite a rewarding cinematic experience.The Revenant has a very powerful atmosphere. The vastness and elemental
hostility of the environment feel very real; you can almost feel the
harshness of the freezing winds and the aggressive waves of the
waterfalls. The emotional interaction between the characters adds a
great deal to the harsh atmosphere as well; there's a great deal of
catharsis in many of the action scenes, due to the sheer expression of
anger displayed.Generally speaking, the film is very well directed. The use of intense
camera angles and mesmeric long takes give off an enticing photogenic
quality. On top of that, each of the cast members turns in quite a
strong performance, particularly its leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom
Hardy; both of their characters are very believable. I was intrigued to
discover that DiCaprio's role is a touch more physical than those he's
played in the past, which are usually more dialogue-based.Another point of interest is that, while The Revenant is a relatively
mainstream film, it has flashes of an art-house aesthetic. Of course,
this can be said of many modern dramas and thrillers, but more
specifically what's worth noting here is the call-backs. There are many
visuals in The Revenant which call to mind other great films such as
Andrei Rublev; Aguirre, Wrath of God, Come and See; and even
Deliverance.So, all in all The Revenant is a pretty good movie: it's unique, it's
intense and it's exceptionally strong in terms of production.

The movie is filmed with very high quality. Also both Leonardo DiCaprio
and Tom Hardy played they role great. Leonardo does deserve an Oscar
here, it is definitely one of his best performances. However, the plot felt very plain and boring to me. As if nothing
really happens through the entire film. Also, since I am familiar with the native American culture I found a
lot of known stuff (tribe names and how they live), but I do feel that
this information was not presented well to the public that is not aware
of the native American people, their history and their culture.I can add that some of the specific scenes were too unrealistic to be
"based on a true story". You can say which scene is definitely NOT
true, which I think spoiled the movie for some viewers.In addition, there were too many slow scenes that present nothing
specific to the viewer, they only made the two-and-a-half-hour
experience a more unpleasant one.To summarize, this is the best made movie that I'll never think of
watching again.

One year after the release of Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Oscar winning
effort, Birdman, he and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki look to take
their seamless, almost cut-free brand of cinema, from the
ultra-intramural of their previous effort, and apply it to the
diametric opposite; the wide-open, exhilaratingly earthy, extramural
scene of a brutal 1820's Dakota. Following the mourning Hugh Glass
(Leonardo DiCaprio) traipse his broken body in pursuit of vengeance
across the fledgling American frontier. Sometimes trippy, sometimes telluric, always proximal to the action of
the unfolding events  for better or worse, this is oft poor Leo's
bared, mud-clagged incisors. This new piece stays away from the naval
gazing, creative existential crisis of Birdman, in favour of a
surprisingly straightforward blockbuster romp; if that's what you want
from it.Being an Iñárritu film, there is plenty going on beneath the clart
cosmetic. Since its release, a number of those involved in the film
have gushed about the West's treatment of indigenous peoples; if
bringing this subject to a wider discourse was the film's intention, I
must admit, I find myself at a loss to have recognised it. While we are
subjected to a very corporeal painting of atrocities against such
peoples, the film never seems to go beyond a 'we did this and we should
feel bad' level of insight. The focus of the goings-on is much more on
the Caucasian players, namely the fur- trapper Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio).The ill-starred Leo, over the course of the film, falls and, quite
literally, hits every branch on the way down. In one of the film's most
indulgent moments, it does fall prey to crossing into self-parody as it
turns into a DiCaprio suffer-a-thon. A rather inapt laugh was uttered
when upon seeing what next disaster was befalling the protagonist, a
mental image was conjured of Homer falling for a second time into
Springfield gorge. This is done with relatively early on in the film's
substantial 156 minute running time, however, and soon gets back on
track, never missing a beat until its climax and allowing Leo to show
some range beyond exhausted, in pain, getting spittle on the lens and
so on.The manner of DiCaprio's performance leads me to address the bison in
the room: The Academy Awards. The timing of the film's release, along
with the casting of the 'always the bridesmaid never the bride' Leo is
a shame, because the film stands to be notably excellent when viewed in
a vacuum, whether it boards the band wagon of Academy attention or not.
The idea that an actor must suffer 'x' in order to get the gong they so
crave is a shame; perhaps, without that unfortunate, extraneous thorn
in his mind, Leo would have given a more nuanced, less grimacing and
frothing approach to the character. Tom Hardy as the wild eyed,
mumbling, but brilliant John Fitzgerald and Dohmnall Gleeson as the
sober and solemn Captain of the beleaguered band, have the room to
fully showcase their expertise in their craft and really impress. Will
Poulter equally inspires and shows competence far beyond his years as
the baby-faced voice of morality amongst growingly desperate men.A somewhat unforeseen turn in Iñárritu's body of work but one that is
no less valid: We are given a spectacle that feels truly like something
never done before in the way which it is presented. Amalgams between
real, in camera work and CGI are seamless, performances, when viewed on
their own merit, are colossal, and if there was ever a film to make you
subconsciously want to pick the grime from underneath your fingernails,
or take a shocked breath of the imagined frigid air, this is it.

Watching this movie, I had a hard time deciding if it was impressive or
ridiculous. But the moment Leonardo DiCaprio cut open a fresh horse
corpse to crawl into it in order to protect himself from the cold, I
knew it had to be the latter.It was a pity really, because after two great scenes at the beginning
of the movie, I inclined towards 'impressive'. The Indians attacking
Leonardo DiCaprio's camp of fur traders is a wonderful scene. Not only
because of its camera work and cinematography, but also because it
shows the fur traders as a bunch of scared, clueless losers. The other
great scene is the bear attack, which is a truly amazing piece of
cinema that makes you wonder how it's done.But after that, the exciting action scenes make way for endless
landscape shots with trees reaching up to the skies, scenes of the
wounded DiCaprio crawling through the snow and miraculously surviving
in the harsh weather, and dreamlike flash backs of his Indian lover,
accompanied by strange whispering sounds.It became harder and harder to take this film seriously, after
DiCaprio's character not only survives the bear attack, but also a fall
in an ice cold river, an attack by violent Indians, a snow storm which
makes him fall from his horse and collapse, and a jump down a ravine
that kills his horse but not him. Also remarkable is that even in a
fierce snow storm his companion is able to find dry twigs to make a
fire, and that in this remote and sparsely populated territory, groups
of people keep bumping into each other.On the plus side: this is a beautifully filmed movie, with some very
intense scenes and a unique view of the way the American wilderness was
conquered. But did it have to be that long?

The Revenant. In this movie, we meet Hugh Glass. He is a frontiersman.
Together with a group, they are on a hide- hunt. But due to a series of
events, Hugh gets attacked by a bear. After this attack he gets left
behind for death by his crew members, and kill his son, now he is out
for revenge for the one who left him behind and killed Hawk... (Hawk is
the name of the son)Let me start this part of my review of with saying that this was a
goddamn beautiful movie.The director of "The Revenant" is Alejandro
González Iñárritu. Last year, as I said in my "Birdman"-review, he was
a unknown man for me. He has this special style, and I really like it.
There were a lot of spectacular scenes in the movie. (More on this
later) The cinematography is so, so pretty. The landscape was brought
into a beautiful picture. The editing was great to, which brings me
back to the scenes. My favorite scene of the movie was the first attack
scene. They made it look like it was one long take, without any cuts.
Alejandro González Iñárritu did this to with "Birdman". But the
brilliant aspect of this was, that there really are cuts, just hidden
away, using CGI, or just skillful editing. Using this technique, they
create a lot of tension. This scene also brings all the characters
together. Due all of these reasons, this was my favorite scene.
Throughout the movie, you can see more of these scenes (like the final
scene, in the end, i'll talk some more about it). The costumes were
well done. They looked worn out, and old. The make-up, looked fine. It
wasn't easy to look at the wounds of DiCaprio, but the scars looked at
moments not too good. The lighting was maybe one of the more impressive
aspects of the movie. It was very good, but they only used real
lighting! This includes fires, sunlight, etc. The music is the next
topic i am going to discus. In "Birdman" there was a lot of very good
music. So I went into this movie expecting the same, unfortunately I
didn't get it. It was still well chosen music, but not as good as in
"Birdman". The sound was good as well. The set design now. Well, there
weren't really a lot of sets. It were almost all nature-sets. The set
that was there, was the camp of the other frontiers. This looked very
realistic to me.The acting. This was amazing. Please, give Leonardo DiCaprio just an
Oscar already! This guy was amazing as Hugh Glass. He keeps surprising
me, with his acting talent. He didn't have a lot of lines, but his
facial expressions, was already enough. The antagonist of this story is
nature, but also Tom Hardy. Hardy played Fitzgerald. He was the person
who killed the son of Hugh, and left Hugh for death. His character was
the most interesting for me. He manipulates persons. Even right before
he starts to fight with Glass. He starts trying to convince him, that
he wasn't lying after all. He was good too, so he can get an Oscar too!
:) No, I am just kidding, he was good, but I don't think that it was
Oscar worthy. Another crew member was Bridger. Will Poulter played him.
By his acting performance I was really surprised. Also by the screen
time he had. I wasn't expecting that he would have such a big role in
the story. His character was like ably. You felt sorry for him, when
they beat him, because of something that he hasn't done. Like I have
said I was surprised by his performance, because it was very good.
Normally I am annoyed by his acting jobs, but this time I luckily
wasn't. The leader of this crew is called Captain Andrew Henry, played
by Domhnall Gleeson. Gleeson seems to appear in every movie I see.
First "Ex Machina" then "Star Wars", and now here. But anyway, he was
very good too. The supporting cast, was well. The one that stood out to
me was the actor of Hawk, Glass' son. Forrest Goodluck played him.The script was written by the director himself, and Mark L. Smith. The
story was good, but not for everyone. There were some boring elements,
and that's why I think a lot of people won't like the movie. The
dialogue was good, even though there wasn't a lot. That was also a very
impressive part. They managed to keep the story interesting, even with
almost no one talking. This also kept me interesting, due to Leo's
Fantastic acting. But now something more about the ending. This was
also shot in almost one take, which made it very tensfull. The fighting
was gritty, which fitted the theme of the movie. It was realistic as
well. It was unpredictable, I wasn't really sure if Glass would win.
Another 'bad' thing was the fact that they tried to put in the thoughts
of Glass. I didn't really mind, but I can understand that some people
will. I think that this was a thing to make us understand Glass better.But overall this was a beautiful shot movie, with fantastic acting, and
some good writing. It is not a movie for everyone, but I would still
recommend watching this movie.8,5/10

The main goof of film which was so annoying was the extraordinary self-
healing system of Leo! It was so exaggerated and obviously no one in a
real world could survive half of his adventures. Moreover, the concept
of movie which is "survival" is an over-used genre and has been
observed in many brilliant movies before like Cast Away. However, it is
good to mention the movie conveyed a good sense about foundation of
United States which was not unseemly from the director Alejandro
González Iñárritu. In general, it is a pity that academy is paying so
much attention to this movie while a masterpiece such as "The Hateful
Eight" is not even nominated for best picture.

Just saw this movie yesterday and it was great. It's about Hugh Glass
who travels with a group of men through the mountains and is left
behind for death after a bear attack. The power of the movie is the
cast (DiCaprio, Hardy and Gleeson) and the way the movie is made. As a
viewer I got the feeling I was there with them. It is very realistic
and some times horrific. Most people, like me, did not get the end of
the movie. It was very quiet when the movie ended and everyone left the
cinema.I left the cinema with the feeling that although this movie is
wonderful to watch, when it will win some Oscars I think the movie (and
the wonderful actors) will be overrated. I kept thinking about Mel
Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) which was, in my point of view, a much
better movie than this one. The Revenant was exciting and authentic,
but from time to time boring. There is no doubt that the bear attack
will become epic. But compared to previous results of other movies,
like the one I mentioned, I think this one is slightly overrated.

5/10 In my opinion it's a bit tiring movie. Great acting by DiCaprio.
Spends too much time at the first part ( survival part) instead of the
second. Worth going to the cinema. It would be better if it didn't last
this much. Worth watching but certainly not the best movie i've ever
seen. I just created an IMDb account and I'm trying to understand how
it works. Very useful so far. This is my first review. I'm pretty bad
at this so it will probably be my last one as well. That's all I had to
say but it won't let me post it because it does not contain enough
lines so I'm writing whatever comes in mind. So I'm sorry if you're
reading this. And also sorry for my English. I'm Greek. Anyway, that
should be enough. Watch the movie if you have nothing better to do.

Alejandro González Iñárritu's two-and-a-half hour odyssey tells the
story of Leonardo DiCaprio's character coming back from near-death to
seek revenge on the man (played by Tom Hardy) who abandoned him and
killed his son. The film is inspired by the true story of Hugh Glass, a
frontiersman who was mauled by a by a grizzly bear near the Missouri
River in 1823. Iñárritu's decision to film "The Revenant" exclusively
with natural light adds to the movie's visceral potency, but some
elements remain unrealistic, including the CGI bison stampede and
certain aspects of the bear mauling. Still, the film's imagery and keen
camera angles force viewers to experience the unrelenting journey with
the characters as they search for meaning through survival.Read more on GAYOT.com

I've now seen all the films nominated for this years best picture Oscar
bar one ( Spotlight ) and without a doubt , in my mind , The Revenant
is the best of the lot . True , it's not a vintage year but this does
have the feel of a film that will stand the test of time. Leonardo
DiCaprio play Glass , a frontiersman who fights for survival after
being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of his own hunting
team , one of whom is particularly nasty , played by Tom Hardy. This is
a classic survival/ revenge movie that looks fantastic ( especially the
bear fight ) and despite being over two and a half hours , never
flounders and that's mainly thanks to a career defining performance
from DiCaprio. This looked like a really tough film to make because of
the conditions and the physical transformation needed but Mexican
director Alejandro González Iñárritu did a fantastic job.

This is a decent movie, but probably not one I will watch again. It's a
"movie experience" kind of movie. Incredible landscapes, sound design,
visual effects, emotional melodrama and wonderful performances from
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, but not a whole lot in the way of a
script beyond the simple revenge narrative. As such, this is the
perfect kind of movie to see in the theater. You really get the benefit
of the big screen and the loud, high-bass surround sound. Basically, go
see it on the big screen, buy some popcorn and enjoy the spectacle and
gritty violence (it is quite uncompromising, I was squirming in my seat
at one part at the end). It will be worth the effort and the money.

This movie does an excellent job portraying human nature at it's roots,
survival! The western expansion timeline and the cold, mountainess
wilderness captures that characters in a unique setting. The story
builds from the start and provides several climactic moments. At times
there were a few points where the scenes were slow and did nothing to
enhance the drama. The acting was captivating and Leonardo DiCaprio
does an excellent job displaying the grit and vulnerability of his
character. Some of the battle and survival scenes can be very gruesome
and vivid, however it is carefully and intentionally done to make the
piece more realistic. At times you will often catch yourself asking "Is
this really happening?". This action/western drama could have looped-in
the different story lines the plot alluded to. It would have helped to
add a little more cohesiveness and understanding of Leonardo DiCaprio's
character. But overall it was a great time period flick that stressed survival,
revenge, loyalty, honor, bigotry, and cultural partnerships. I would
recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a story about
action, drama, and conflict. It is not your typical old western movie.

Directing is great. Acting is, for me, best in 2015. Script is good,
could be better. Cinematography is awesome, costumes are great as well
as editing and visual effects, but there is just something that does
not let me rate it above 8. It's not really a legendary movie. Nothing
makes it special. Survival/adventure story about revenge. Revenge is in
the second plan even. It gets a little boring. Overall they should have
spent some more time to make the story better and more interesting.Alejandro is brilliant. The use of natural light is done perfectly.
Combination of brilliant directing, acting, really surviving in the
nature and beautifully captured landscapes is what brought this movie
best picture and all other Oscar nominations.Sound mixing and editing is excellent, but there are some other movies
that could get an Oscar for that, so all in all great, but needs a
little more to be best in 2015 for sound mixing and editing.It is, I would say, 100% guaranteed that Leonardo will finally win an
Oscar. His role was the hardest one this year and he pulled it of
beautifully. Maybe his best acting job ever. Tom Hardy, brilliant actor
with huge potential. Great acting from him, not just in this movie, but
in all movies he stared in 2015. Three great movies and three great
acting performances from him. He worked hard in 2015 and has done
everything beautifully, so he deserves an Oscar.To sum up. Excellent piece of art brilliantly made by cast and crew.
Some of the best acting performances in 2015. Everything is done
perfectly, but there is just something missing to make it legendary, to
make it really stand out.

I normally like these type of movies ,love survivorman , yet this was
an awful movie IMO and way too unrealistic. The fact that Leonardo got
nominated for this and Will Smith didn't shows what those old white
guys like.They remind me of the NFL back room old white guys just
wanting to keep rolling in the money whatever the cost.Last year Selma
was ignored and specifically David Oyelowo.The phoney part of the Revenant ,besides the bear , to me was when he
was in the freezing water with huge heavy coats on, didn't sink and
didn't freeze and after getting out had no dry clothes or a fire. And
how many grunts and groans were in this script for him.

Leonardo Dicaprio in yet another Oscar-nominated leading role. This
time he embodies the most physical role of his career. Muttering
minimal dialogue (sometimes not even English) all the while going thru
hardship after hardship. He plays a man with nothing left to lose but a
riveting will to prosper. But yet again as we've seen in the past, Leo doesn't steal the show.
The ensemble cast is terrific. Domnhall Gleeson is understated and
professional, Will Poulter is the most relatable, being naive and
trusting in a world full of selfishness he's a character we feel for.
Tom Hardy as his leery self is as grumbly and mumbly as ever, he plays
a despicable man terrifically. That being said his character is
complex, not just another cardboard cut out embodiment of evil, instead
he's a man of his time, ruthless and degenerate while all the while
still admired albeit in a nasty way.The technical aspects of this film are terrific but may come off as
pretentious to some. Iñárritu and lubezki push the boundaries of modern
film yet again, a period piece shot like a documentary sounds arty and
shite on paper but on the big screen it is completely immersive.The film is not perfect... Heavy handed in it's message and literally
Gladiator in early America. But these obvious minor flaws are
outweighed by the proficiency and skill of a great crew with everybody
from cast to cinematographer on top form giving it there all. You can
not only feel the toil on the screen but from behind the camera as
well.

through all the tribulations the cast and crew had it while shooting
this film, I must say, HATS OFF to everyone who stuck together to get
this modern day masterpiece come to all of us. I am still hunting and
going through each and every detail related to the making of this epic,
bits and pieces, newer things are getting discovered. Story/Screenplay
- 7/10 Editing: Wow, I mean. FLAWLESS. 9.5/10 (worthy of a nomination)
Cinematography: 100/10. (And the Oscar goes to EMMANUEL LUBEZKI) (Koi
Mai ka laal khada nahi reh payega is film ke saamne) Performance: Job
well done by both Leonardo and Tom Hardy. Will feel pity If Leo gets an
Oscar for this film, there are far better films he has worked and he
deserved then (It will be similar to Scorcese winning it for Departed -
‪#‎pityoscar‬) Direction: Great. Fantabulous. Larger than Life.
Amazing. (Let's not waste an academy here at least)

Honestly I was expecting a little bit more from this, it's a good film
still but it could have been polished up a lot more. I have to say this
film is very brutal even when Leonardo DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass
is violently mauled by a grizzly bear, gosh he ended up in a right
state after that, realistically most people would not survive from a
bear attack, even after this he would go into extreme lengths to
survive. Other than this the film had a lot of parts where nothing was
happening, this is what I mean by wishing the film had more
improvements like DiCaprio going all Rambo or something but that's just
me and my wishful thinking mind.

I absolutely understand the critical acclaim heralded onto The
Revenant. If you begin to look deep inside the inner working of The
Revenant you can't help but be impressed. They shot 100% using natural
light, the cinematography is stunning, the camera work beautiful, the
performances gritty and real...the film from a film making standpoint
is a masterpiece. However from a pure cinematic entertainment
standpoint it is a very, very, very long story about a guy stumbling
through the wilderness for two hours and exacting revenge for another
half hour. The Revenant is a piece of art, it was made to be so. I
don't know how anyone could defend it for it's brilliant script or
multi-faceted characters because neither one is true. Don't get me
wrong, Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic in the role but he's fantastic at
showing a man surviving, not for giving this historically powerful
character. It is like seeing a beautiful painting that is just stunning
but staring at it for 2 1/2 hours. I guess what I'm getting at is there
isn't a lot of substance to it and I cannot agree that it is anywhere
near the best movie of the year because it is successful in one area of
film making.Does that mean star Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't deserve an Oscar? No not
at all. DiCaprio is mesmerizing in this role. He shows an intensity and
a fear and this grit for survival that is really quite powerful. He
desires vengeance enough to survive the very worst conditions possible.
The bear attack is definitely brutal and really something to remember
in the beginning. Tom Hardy is what Tom Hardy is nowadays. He does a
funny voice and acts odd and that's his role. His character is
essentially the villain and the focus of DiCaprio's vengeance but very
underdeveloped character and not a lot of scenes considering. There are
a few other half decent supporting roles that are almost cameos more
than anything such as Will Poulter and Domnhall Gleeson.One thing I am certain of is that director Alejandro González Iñárritu
deserves his Oscar nod. The man has incredible style and if you watched
The Revenant with no sound on, I think you would likely be mesmerized
by the world he creates. As I mentioned before the setting and camera
work is brilliant. I could go back and watch this again just for the
little details in the background. The Revenant is a beautiful piece of
art but from an entertainment standpoint it misses the mark in several
ways. It has some intense climatic moments (the bear attack and the end
scene) but what is in the middle leaves you scratching your head more
than enjoying the concept. It's a two and a half hour film that was at
least an hour longer than it needed to be. It certainly wouldn't be my
choice for best picture but for those wild and crazy critics, I do
understand. 7/10

When a movie like this hops into the IMDb top 250 and keeps rising with
each passing day, I gotta see what the big deal is. I have been aware
of this movie for quite sometime and I was already curious when I saw
the trailer, but now that it had a high rating, it had my attention
(see what I did there?).Forget about the plot synopsis, I'm just going to tell you my thoughts
on the movie. It's pretty good. It obviously looks incredible and
Emmanuel Lubezki is probably going to win his third Oscar in a row
(after Gravity and Birdman). What struck me the most about this ambitious film is how well it
captures the feeling of being out in the cold, just trying to survive
with the possibility that you might not make it home. With a running
time of 156 minutes, the film feels like it's four hours long. The
pacing is intentionally slow and really allows us to suffer alongside
Dicaprio as he endures plenty of discomfort (saying it like that feels
like an understatement). However, there was very little about the story and characters that
resonated with me. It's not bad, but I didn't feel like it was great
either. It also doesn't help that you can't understand what they're
saying part of the time. Tom Hardy does a lot of talking in one scene
early on but all I understood were select words here and there. I get
that they were probably trying to go for a sense of realism, but if a
character is talking for a few minutes, what they have to say is most
likely important and we should at the very least here most of it. But I
didn't and think there are many others that are in the same boat. So be sure to check out The Revenant, I didn't find it amazing, but you
might and even if you don't, it is certainly a unique experience.

This movie is Eye candy .. a visual treat for movie lovers although it
doesn't have dialogue the movie speaks by it's actions , I am not
saying it's the best movie of the year many find it boring and that for
an extent is right too .. the movie dragged at the end it can be better
edited ..Pros -1.Visually the best movie i saw till now . 2.Leo's acting is amazing
(as always). 3.That bear scene is gruesome and terrifying. 4.tom hardy
and rest of crew did well too.Cons -1.movie length , it can be trimmed a bit to grab audience attention.
2.nothing more if you like action movies you may get a bit disappointed
by this flick !! hope my review helped you all :)

This movie is visually stunning. The landscapes, sunset,sunrise, clouds
etc., were simply magnificent. The entire credit for this film goes to
Emmanuel Lubezki for his top notch work in cinematography.But the
drawback of this film is it's duration.The entire film can be wound up
to one hour but it's duration is 158 minutes! After 30 minutes you feel
bored and the script becomes predictable.Performances by Dicaprio and
Tom Hardy were outstanding. This film may not deserve an Oscar but the
artists do deserve them. May be this film fulfill the dream of
DeCaprio. Watch out for best landscapes and the performances if you can
bear them.Else wait to watch it in Blu-Ray. Note: This is my personal
opinion. No offense.

Well, well, well. I watched The Revenant on the recommendation of a
friend who is usually spot on with his films. The film opens in great
fashion, with an attack by the natives. The cinematography for this
scene and the Bear attack was fantastic. The cast is extremely strong
too, and the back drop is stunning a visually beautiful film, and that
is where it ends. After the Bear attack,the film is one of the most
boring films I have ever seen. If not for the above I would have given
it 1/10. I have never seen such hype over such a bland film. There is
no meaningful dialogue at any point of the film. There is no epic
musical score, which a film like this craves, and worst of all, an
extremely threadbare story. The Revenant is almost the abandoned love
child of Wolverine and Last of the Mohicans. The entire film is
extraordinarily unbelievable, with Glass being the man who can't die.
If you want to watch two and a half hours of watching someone crawl
around the floor, growl and dribble then head to your nearest city
centre on a student night. It'll save you £25.

I went to this movie with high hopes. The trailers looked awesome and,
after such classics as Inception, I would see anything with Hardy and
Di Caprio. I left at the end of the movie, though, terribly terribly
disappointed.Don't get me wrong; much of the movie is very strong: the sound design,
the visuals, the strong sense of realism. As a travelogue for the wild
mountains, it is superb.However, when I enter a cinema to watch a movie, I enter a contract
with the director: I will give you my attention, reactions and
engagement if you give me the opportunities to engage. I therefore
expect that a director will give me character development, mystery,
surprise, plot development, unexpected twists or one of the basic (and
ancient - decent story telling is not a modern thing) elements of good
stories. Engage me, Mister Director! Give me a reason to care! Make me
remember - and rave about and love! - your movie for years to come! Let
me know that part of your craft is a desire to please the audience!
However, Revenant gives me none of that. Apart from one delightful,
terribly short - and brutally terminated - moment of humour, there is
nothing in this movie to engage me. There are no human connections, no
surprises with the plot, no character development, no suspense, nothing
that asks me to care.The characters remain flat and unchanging throughout and the end is
obvious from early stages. The movie is a brutal, hyper-realistic and
bleak exercise in portraying a series of events without ANY concern for
the audience. It is, ultimately and sadly, tedious. It should really
have finished after 1.5 hours, but dragged on for many dull minutes of
Di Caprio being forced (by the director ultimately) into one
life-threatening situation after another.As a technical exercise, this movie is superb. As a human story, it is
empty and without heart.Avoid.

The best thing I can say is that this movie was beautiful, a real feast
for the eyes. Every shot was truly breathtaking. You could tell that he
was using all natural light and it really payed off. As far as plot and substance, I personally I felt like I had to wade
through A LOT of unnecessary gore to get to a highly unsatisfactory
ending. Not to say I don't like gore, I have been known to like my fair
share of bloody dramas. Its just that this film just seemed to be
"beating a dead horse" so to speak, amongst other things to that poor
dead horse. The ending (which I wont get into) was just.... a let down!
at least to me. If I'm going to feel that uncomfortable during a movie
I want to feel validated at the end.

Really, folks? Eight out of ten? Was this because of the star power,
(only heard of one and that's L. DiCap.), or because you all were
drunk? First of all, the dialogue was no more than probably 500 lines
or so. Secondly the movie was basically black and white. Thirdly half
of the movie is with L. DiC. writhing around on the ground after first:
being torn apart by a bear, (which was the only good part of the
movie), secondly: beginning to heal, fourthly; after someone, (and I
won't say who), gets knifed, and finally after he and his horse go
riding over a cliff and he gets ejected into a tree. (Maybe the story
could have been called JOB, Part II). Oh, and I forgot the audio sucked
and it was difficult to understand what little was said. The bear scene
was cool I'll admit, but what dope would stand around doing nothing
after seeing baby bears running around? You gotta know WHO is around
the corner and she ain't happy.

Leo DiCaprio is being suggested for an Oscar for this film.No idea why.This film starts well...the attack on the camp by native American's is
brutal and realistic then there's the Leo versus the bear scene which
is great. Most interesting factor in the movie is the relationship
between Leo and his son but that was cut short when bad guy of the
movie Tom Hardy kills his son to force the plot pretty early in the
film. Then Leo spends 75% (maybe more) crawling around injured with his
throat damaged which means nearly zero dialogue from his character. So
we're left with Tom Hardy to carry the film and story verbally. Which
is never a good idea since in most movies he's in majority of people
can't understand a word he says half the time.There's little action in the second half, mainly just a forced Leo
versus hardy finale which is nothing special.This movie is insanely over-hyped and will go on the pile of films that
won't be watched twice.Leo DiCaprio if you do get an Oscar be sure to realize it wasn't for
this film but something you did earlier in your career.

A shaw, who are all the black and white film converts,the
cinematography has merit, that is if you live in a colorless world but
I personally enjoy movies that have some color. By watching the film
you will learn some survival techniques but really, is this what you
want? There is walking and more walking with some gore (the highlights)
in a bleak environment. Kudos to DiCaprio to have survived the filming
in these conditions, but it wasn't deserving of a Golden Globe and
certainly will not be deserving of an Oscar, although he will probably
win it. The dialogue is non-existent, but grimaces of the painful
experience seem to be what the film underlines.

As a piece of art this movie should deserve a 10 star rate. Stunning
photography , great actors'performances and great filming with
astonishing camera angles and movements. Cinema is not only art but
entertainment - we go to the movies expecting to laugh, cry think and
feel part of the story. In my opinion considering these aspects this
movie fails. The movie tells a story of a frontiersman and pelt trader
that is left by his own luck after considered near dead due to severe
wounds caused by a bear attack. Everything that follows are the
struggle for life and the revenge appetite to find the man that killed
his son. A very well done movie production but based on a loose and not
captivating story.

An excellent film. The story was overwhelmingly impressive, and the
shots used took my breath away. This film has it all, actor talent,
good use of cgi, best atmospheric music I've heard in a film for a very
very long time. And the setting, spectacular. If you have not seen this
film, I would recommend the cinema screening, as it enables you to
experience the landscapes in all their glory. Every scene in this film
makes me want more, and it delivers, the shots may be long, maybe
borderline dull for some, but I could not get enough of the rustling of
trees, Leonardo breathing, and walking. 10/10, this is what a movie
should be.

From the opening of the movie, you already have a good idea that the
work is masterful. From the shots of the flowing water in the middle of
the forest to the shots of the mountains and the sky, the technical
achievement is impressive, most notably the camera work and the
visuals. It started great, and then augmented by Leonardo's
performance, it retained its strength towards the end. Although it's
not much on the writing department, with some forgettable
conversations, its driving force is the visuals, and perhaps it can be
even told well as a silent film, although we might miss the aptly
written film music. The point here is that this is one of the best
directed films of the year and in many years. One notable scene is the
raid of the American natives against a band of White hunters. Albeit
small in scale, it felt grand and challenging to shoot, given the
unique angles and action sequences. It was rather a gory scene, which
Alejandro Inarritu masterfully mixed with artistic values.There were a lot of other scenes with bloodshed and gore, and in terms
of effective use of visual effects, it is the battle with the huge bear
that stood out among the rest. If we talk about the most violent among
them, one cannot rule out the combat in the last part of the movie.
Although it is not really as violent as most of Tarantino's movies, one
cannot help to notice the director's fascination of the artistic value
of blood in the snow. Apart from the direction, there were two other strong driving forces in
the movie: DiCaprio's performance and the cinematography. The role was
definitely challenging, but then it was a bull's eye. The other
characters were not developed well, but you will not be bothered by it
because the plot is simple. Miss some of their conversations and you
won't miss a lot. It was after all a director's film about survival and
revenge, impressively made.

'The Revenant' provides me with all I have been looking for during the
last year without success: a bunch of feelings, which get my full
attention through the movie.The film is based on a true story that leaves you without words. The
realism is obvious from the very beginning. Believe me or not, but the
natural light makes a difference. Native dialogues fit well in the
script. Moreover, the interaction of the characters is fluent during
the entire plot. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is majestic (he truly deserves an Oscar
this time). He is able to express all the necessary types of feelings
using few words. Tom Hardy makes a credible antagonist producing hate
on the viewer. Even Will Poulter is good and believable in this movie.In conclusion, when I watch a film, I search for learning and emotions
and 'The Revenant' fulfill these requirements. Hence, I strongly
recommend you to see this masterpiece, but please go to the cinema; it
is worth it.

Great Director? check... Great cinematographer? check... Grade A
actors? check... The Revenant has been number 1 on my watch list since
I first heard it was getting made. The movie took the best director (
Innaritu) and cinematographer (Lubezki) of the the last few years and
matched them with Leo and Tom Hardy in the main roles. I am slightly
biased since those two actors have been my favorites for years, but
this combination made The Revenant the best movie of the year for me!!The Revenant is based on a true story, as Hugh Glass (Leo) has to
battle a winder of the 1820's. Glass is attacked by a bear, and then
has his son killed by John Fitzgerald (Hardy) as he is left for dead.
Glass then starts a track for revenge as the story unfolds.I was first interested in this movie because Leo was set as the star. I
was not disappointed in his performance at all as I believe he should
win the Oscar this year. He was not the best actor in this movie
though. That title should go to Tom Hardy. He gets so into this
character that its hard to even tell that its him! I was shocked that
he didn't get nominated for a Globe, but I think he should definitely
be in the running for the Oscar. He is magnificent and had his best
performance of his career. Leo made me interested in The Revenant, but that is not the reason I
loved this movie. The scenery and technical aspects of this movie were
outstanding. I was left in complete shock after seeing some of the
scenes. How can they possibly shoot a movie so well?? I was left
wondering how they put together a few of the scenes while keeping them
so realistic. A great example of this is the bear attack seen, which
should go down as one of the best shot scenes in cinema history. Put
these scenes together with the beautiful scenery and landscape, and it
is easy to say that Inarritu made a masterpiece.The Revenant is quite simply the best movie I have seen in the last few
years. There is no flaw. The acting, the editing, the visual, etc...
All of it was done to perfection. Expect The Revenant to clean house
this year at the Oscars, as it should.

I've just watched this movie and I gotta admit that this movie is the
best in 2015. This movie was release yesterday in my country and I
won't hesitate to watching this film as soon as possible. The settings
are great and very eye-catching. The plot has made me feel like I was
in the film. I know this film won't disappoint me. Everybody I know
seems like it and said that this is very good. And that opinions
strengthen my desire to watch this movie. It's amazing. Thumbs up for
the director, crew, and of course, the actors! Good work and good job.
Hope you guys get the Oscar because you deserve it. The Revenant is
worth your time.

I never review movies that has so many reviews, mainly because
everything is said when it has over 700 reviews. This time though I've
only read this movie is great but has no plot, that this guy has more
lives than a cat, and that revenge is second to the survival story.*BIG FAT spoilers* I don't think so, this is not a survival story,
cause Glass's purpose was never to survive. He only wanted to revenge,
and moved by this desire, he survived the unthinkable, which makes
sense because only with a huge determination and soul pain, could
somebody endure all he went through. So it only makes sense that his
pain would motive his revenge desire and his fight for survival. He
said it himself, that he was not afraid to die, so he only did it to
revenge.Sure, probably there was not a plot twist or i wasn't the most original
story. But life is kind of always the same stuff over and over again,
and this movie made epic and beautiful, things that we all know: human
determination and love, making possible the impossible.

I've seen The Revenant three times and intend to see it again. It's a
flat-out masterpiece.This film is widely misunderstood, in the way many great works have
been. When I read comments like "non-credible plot twists" and
"boring," I remember that critics called Beethoven's Symphony No. 9
"very wearying." Missing the message, they called Hemingway's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, The Old Man and the Sea, "boring." They called
Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby "not too probable."If you're looking for a feel-good Hollywood movie that does your
thinking for you, then no, this probably isn't your film. If you're looking for philosophical depth, breathtaking cinematography,
and cutting edge film making, go buy a ticket. The Revenant is a classic hero's journey, and it's a shamanic one as
well. DiCaprio's character, Hugh Glass, is ripped apart physically and
mentally. Along the way he is healed and reborn. By his journey's end,
he's transformed. We all have our own bear to fight in life. We all have the choice to
give up or go on. Ultimately, we all must examine our motives. The
Revenant's themes resonate more powerfully with each viewing--and the
glory of Nature through Lubezski's lens never gets old.

I must admit that going to see this movie, I was expecting prolonged
boring scenes to serve the purpose of brutal loneliness in the wild.
However, the opening scenes of mini battles between native tribes and
the fur trapping squad, the theatrical method by which the director
captures these moments drew me right in. Certainly the director with
his cast and crew members spared no effort to depict man's merciless
battle over the riches of one land, the rawness and brutality of how
far a man would go to survive death even if it was on the expense of
another man's life.Without a doubt the director's decision to shoot this movie in the
hostile wilderness made the movie what it is and helped the actors rise
to the state of mind of the real life characters who lived that same
rawness and hostility. What intensifies this piece of great work are the two gravely talented
actors, Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy, playing Hugh Glass and John
Fitzegerald. These two continue to excel and prove that they are indeed
the best in their generation. Leo with his amazing utilization of his
body and face to portray the character's agony, despair and finally
determination was behind yet another Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy,on the
other hand, as John Fitzegerald shows off his humongous acting skills
with the use of his eyes and voice, as the rest of his face is covered
in this big beard, to create this unyielding, rugged and sometimes
seemingly unstable character, that also won him the appraise of the
academy with a nomination for best actor in a supporting role. The movie would not have been the same without those two men.The Revenant has been nominated for 12 Academy awards including best
picture, best lead actor and best actor in a supporting role and I am
rooting for this movie in all these categories.

Just as the protagonist in his latest film, Alejandro G. Inarritu had
to struggle and will himself in finishing this ambitious project. The
production experienced numerous setbacks with locations, switching of
producers, cast and crew members suffering from hypothermia and an
overblown budget. This had me worrying that the project was just
impossible to make. Inarritu pushed through and the eventual end result
is the complete vision of a genius creative mind displaying some of the
best filmmaking I've seen in a while.The Revenant is an intense and visceral viewing experience based on the
true story of Hugh Glass's survival story in the frontier of 1823. The
screenplay of Inarritu is pretty straight forward: a group of fur
trappers, including Glass, are finishing up their deployment when Hugh
gets attacked and mauled by a grizzly bear, leaving him near dead. His
fellow trappers see no use in trying to keep him alive and eventually
leave him to die. Remarkably, Glass survives and vows to take revenge
on the trappers that left him for dead. In the Revenant, you follow
Hugh Glass on his incredible survival journey through the dangers of
hostile natives and the forces of nature itself. The reason this movie
works so well is because you truly care about its protagonist, played
brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio. He further displays his incredible
range as an actor in playing a role with minimal dialogue, with parts
in the native American language as well. This physically demanding role
forced DiCaprio to show the internal rage and struggle of Glass mainly
through his facial expressions and body movements, and he does so
exquisitely. All of the acting performances were impeccable including
Tom Hardy, who plays a fellow fur trapper John Fitzgerald and matches
Leo's intensity in every scene. Domhnall Gleeson, who plays captain
Henry, impressively holds his own alongside these two acting heavy
weights in mediating some of their interactions. Another addition to
his remarkable resume of 2015. I was pleasantly surprised by Will
Poulter's casting in the film, as his young career consisted mainly of
comedic roles. However, he gave a solid performance as the young and
earnest trapper Bridger. Credit Inarritu for getting great performances
out of all his actors and achieving good chemistry between them.Another great achievement of the film is the unbelievable
cinematography by Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki. Here, the man is on top of
his game, showing that he is the best cinematographer working today.
Throughout the movie, he only works with natural light created by
sunlight and fire, and uses them beautifully. The movie looks stunning
and features gorgeous landscapes, long takes to heighten intensity and
meticulous camera-work. Noticeably in the opening battle scene, which
is one long intense take where the camera point-of-view switches
between different character perspectives. Some of his trademark low
angle close-ups were even used during these scenes where water, spit
and blood would find their way onto the camera lens. In addition, the
composition of some nature images were reminiscent of his work in
Terrence Malik's "The Tree of Life" and fitted nicely during the
spiritual parts of the movie. The score by famous Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto is rather
understated but used effectively to convey pain and despair. The sounds
of the cold wind, snowfall, streaming rivers and mud are already
sufficient to make us feel like we are suffering alongside the
characters. All aspects of this film were done perfectly, whether it was the sound,
visuals, the costumes, acting or editing. This all results in a unique
film viewing experience I've never had before, transporting me to the
ice cold frontier. This all was topped by the awe- inspiring bear
attack scene, which is already turning iconic in the film industry.All in all, the Revenant is a great achievement in filmmaking, thanks
to the passion and sacrifice of all the people involved. As Leo stated:
"Suffering is temporary, film is forever."

Revenant *revuh-nuh nt*nouna person who returns. a person who returns as a spirit after death;
ghost.There is a lot that can be said for the unfairness in Leonardo DiCaprio
never receiving an Oscar, despite his tremendous performances in quite
a number of movies. I have a sneaking suspicion that some people still
think of him as the pretty-boy from Titanic and The Beach, and that is
really a shame. Because DiCaprio is one of the hardest working actors
today (he averages just over one film per year, ever since his
breakthrough in What's Eating Gilbert Grape in 1993, and has as of
today 36 projects listed as "in development" on IMDb 36!). And not
only that  he is one of the best actors out there, the man seem able
to play almost anything, and after seeing him in The Revenant, I have
come to the conclusion that Leonardo DiCaprio will from now on be able
to make me buy a movie ticket based on his involvement alone.The Revenant tells the (inspired by true events) story of Hugh Glass,
an explorer leading a small team of surviving fur trappers through the
vicious winter wilderness that is 1820's America, after they have been
attacked  and most of them killed  by native Americans. On a scout
tour in the forest, Glass finds himself standing between two grizzly
bear cubs and their mother, and he is brutally attackedI will say no more, even though there is a LOT more that could be said,
you will have to (and I encourage you to) see for yourself!Let's get a few things out straight away. This IS DiCaprios film, he
plays Glass and it is his story we get to follow. The pain, misery,
fear, frustration and anger are all very palpable for me as the viewer.
I can see it in DiCaprios face and I can hear it in his voice  what
little he has left of it, after the bear tore out his throat. He
embodies all the emotions to such a degree that I actually felt the
freezing cold water and the snow, sitting there in the theater 
dressed in my thick sweater. The camera is right there, in his face
His dirty, banged up, tired and determined face. This is a film about
survival, about determination and about not succumbing to any sort of
fate. It is also about revenge  but that is very much a secondary
point. -This is DiCaprios tour de force, and there should be no
hesitation about that.That being said, I would not be surprised if Tom Hardys performance as
John Fitzgerald is mentioned in as equal high regard. Hardy has always
been a fascinating actor, who seem able to play everything from the
leading man in romantic comedies (This Means War, 2012) to super
villains in superhero-movies (The Dark Knight Rises, 2012). But what he
does best though is play lunatics The kind of trouble stirring
lunatics that stand on the wall, screaming, banging their chest and
rally everybody to get the revolution going! But if you look in their
face, you can see that all they really want is chaos, violence and
disorder. Tom Hardy is fantastic in this film, relishing in playing a
character that you instinctively hate, already from the start! -It's in
the eyesThe Revenant moves seamlessly between intimate (and sometimes painful)
closeups, to sweeping landscape shots, showcasing not so much the
beauty as the isolation and the relentlessness of nature, interspersed
with Glass' dream like hallucinations of his wife and child. The movie
is shot using real light (as in no stage lights) and it has a very
gritty and real feel to it  a style not unknown to director Alejandro
González Iñárritu, who's breakthrough was the fantastic Amores Perros
(2000). Making my way through the movie, after the fact, I find it hard
to imagine anyone else, other than Alejandro, directing it  and
certainly no one else other than DiCaprio starring in it-Make no mistake about it, this movie is a MUST SEE!One last thing, because the scene where Glass is attacked by the
grizzly bear absolutely needs to be mentioned! I have seen a ridiculous
amount of movies where characters are attacked by large
animals/creatures. Everything from acid spitting aliens, dinosaurs and
toxic waste enhanced spiders to lions, tigers and bears  oh my. But
the bear attack in The Revenant is the most horrific, panic filled and
 for lack of a better word  REAL I have ever seen! I cannot remember
blinking, or even breathing at all during that scene! When you go see
this movie (and you REALLY should), it will grab you from the get go,
and you will have forgotten all about the bear attack  until it
happens, and then you will wish you could forget it.but you never
will!

Visceral... Onslaught on the senses... Nail-biting... Unforgiving...
Brutal... Punishing... Riveting... Chest heavingly breathtaking...
Spiritually meditative... Hellishly harrowing... Disconcertingly
beautiful. Believe the hype. This is master cinema!The Revenant feels like it could easily be reduced to the usual revenge
thriller platitude, but Alejandro González Iñárritu just loves his big
themes - redemption, loyalty, betrayal, survival, loss and revenge.
What Iñárritu does so masterfully well here is that he creates a world
so real that this is the only world that matters for 2.5 hours. Then he
amplifies these themes till they filled the entire canvas. This is no
wrong move. Every one is calibrated to hit the right note. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is fluid, contrasting against the
heaviness of the narrative. It feels like Birdman all over again with
all the sublime long takes but IMHO he absolutely ups the ante with his
hovering and weaving shots drawing you directly into the action. The
opening attack scene reminds me so much of the storming of the beaches
of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. It draws you in, making you one of
the frontiersmen under siege. There is such a level of realism to the
action because Lubezki uses natural lighting in all his shots except
for one scene. While my eyes were riveted on the mayhem and madness, I
remember feeling a little sad for Roger Deakins' outstanding work in
Sicaro. I have a strong feeling it is not going to be his year again. Talking about strong feelings, I think Leonardo DiCaprio is almost a
shoo-in for Best Actor. If the Academy loves to give the Oscar to
long-suffering and tortured soul characters, then DiCaprio deserves at
least 3 awards for The Revenant. OMG... The stuff that happens to
him... Getting mauled by a bear, left for dead in a grave, having to
eat raw nasties to survive... Give him the award already. Not only did
DiCaprio bring his A game, so too did Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson
and Tom Hardy. The latter fully deserves his Best Supporting Actor
nomination. His enthralling portrayal brought an internal logic to his
character and I could understand so vividly how he ticks. As much as the film is about so many things, I also feel it is about
nature. This isn't an ode detailing the awe of Mother Nature but about
the danger and no-holds-barred take-no- prisoner nature of it. Nature
is treated with the deepest respect and it is constantly fraught with
danger from every angle. Nature is definitely one of the stars of the
film. This is a film that above all else has a certain death rattle rhythm to
it and Iñárritu's hold on the proceedings is impeccable. He is the
master. To watch misery heaping on misery and pain piling on pain for
2.5 hours do not make for easy viewing but Iñárritu's command is
absolute. This is not a movie for all tastes. In fact this is not a
movie. It is an event and you are in good hands.

With so many poor stories and plot lines often undertaken in mainstream
film, when a director and actors get a chance to partake in a
potentially great story like The Revenant, you have to come through.
The potential for greatness is right in your hands. So without being too wordy or descriptive this movie is a Failed
Opportunity at Greatness and is completely over-rated. No reason awards
should be going out in this film except for cinematography and to Tom
Hardy (who was great!).PROs: -The film did do a fairly good job of capturing the brutal
frontier life, the hardship of survival in the west during the early
1800's, and gosh just how stinkin hard life must have been back then.
-The imagery and cinematography was GREAT. The scenes were visually
epic. The bear scene was so raw. The film was just plain raw and real
feeling. -At no point did you feel good or happy during the movie
(except snowflake eating scene). And that's a success, in that they
were certainly going for that feel.CONs: -Considering everything above, this movie bombed. Creating the
above PROs on a $135,000,000 budget is easy. Making it more than that
is the challenge. Not much was added on by directing and acting. -2 1/2
hour movie that had ZERO character development (except for Tom Hardy's
character Fitzgerald). He was great not by script but by personal
performance. Everyone else was hollow and uninspiring. -The story did
not grip you in anyway. At no point did I find myself caring for
Glass(DiCaprio), or anyone else outside of maybe Will Poulter's
character Bridger. -There was little clarity as to where, why, and for
who everyone was living for. No sense of purpose. -Leo's performance
was so OVERRATED. He did not portray ruggedness, mournfulness,
frustration, anger, revenge, in anyway. Not through facial expression,
sound, or action. I can't believe he's getting so much credit for this
role!?!? Why, because it was hard to film!? What a joke. -The revenge
chase should have lasted longer. It was a week ending. -The soundtrack
was just OK. With minimal dialogue, and a primarily visual film, you
need to hit a homerun with the soundtrack. Very disappointing. And that's quite it. Just a straight up disappointing film. Might be
worth watching just for the visuals and bear scene. Outside of that,
I'm glad to never see it again. It was a combination of "The Way Back" and "The Road". Just not as good
as either film.

The Revenant does something very different from what we see today in
films. It doesn't try to tell a story, but to have the audience
experience it. The Revenant is based on the real life journey of trapper Hugh Glass
(Leonardo Dicaprio) as he makes his way across the American Wilderness
in the early 1800s after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by
his fellow trappers. There are also several subplots in the film that
all culminate in the final, but by the end they all tie back to Glass's
journey. If you asked what The Revenant is in one word it would be visceral. For
most of Glass's journey he is alone, and that means much of the film is
without dialogue. The film chooses to tell its story through visuals
instead, and this is certainly helped by the beautiful cinematography.
The shots are so wide and expansive showing a huge, empty, snow-
covered land that Glass must trek. It truly is so breathtaking that it
seems to almost be alien, the land seems so unfamiliar by today's
highly modernized society that the film is almost a fantasy. However,
there is a point where the expansive shots become somewhat intrusive
and break the narrative's flow, but it is hard to complain as each one
is more beautiful than the last. There are also many nuances that help
the film become more immersive, such as when characters breathe the
camera lens will become foggy or the camera will switch from the
perspective of the character to the perspective of the audience (This
entails parts that go from a first person perspective to a third person
perspective). These are small details, but they help the film create a
much more realistic world. If you were forced to describe The Revenant
with another word it would be unpleasant. From the brutally clear sound
mixing to the downright terrifying action sequences, The Revenant is
not for the faint of heart. The film immerses you in its reality, but
that reality is an incredibly brutal one. Some scenes go on for so long
while Glass endures such physical pain that is hard to watch, let alone
stomach. Even the sounds and sights can be disorienting, confusing or
just downright painful (such as one part where a man repeatedly scrapes
a knife against a canteen) and even though the film going experience is
certainly not a fun one because of this, but it almost puts you in
Glass's shoes by subjecting you to the harsh reality that he lives in. Now since a lot of the film is just Glass attempting to survive that
means for the whole film to work, Leonardo Dicaprio has to be
believable as Glass. He succeeds with flying colors, and with very few
words. His actions and facial expressions communicate much of Glass's
thoughts from disgust to anger to one scene where Glass shows a hint of
joy. There are many little details in his performance that really help
make it further believable. There is one part where all Glass does is
turn around to investigate a strange sound, all Dicaprio has to do in
this scene is turn around. However, there is a slight detail in his
face that makes it more believable: he raises his eyebrow before
turning around. It seems like a very small thing, but it shows
Dicaprio's commitment to the role down to the slightest detail.
Conclusion: While certainly not without its flaws, The Revenant is a
brutal, harsh and quiet visceral experience, one that will draw you in,
thrash you around and spit you out.

When 'The Revenant' was announced, I figured it was just another movie
that Leo signed on for to get his Oscar. Then the first trailer dropped
and my opinion turned on a dime. This film was very well done. I see
where people are coming from when they think the movie is hollow.
However, people need to think a bit deeper in this film. There are
multiple deeper messages than just being a revenge story throughout the
piece. First things first, Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is some of the
greatest of all time. People will lean forward in their seats from
multiple long and up close shots that blow your mind and make you
wonder just how each shot was done.Many people are talking about DiCaprio's performance and ignoring
another large part of the film. While Leonardo DiCaprio's performance
is mainly physical as he only has about 20 or so lines of dialogue
(most of which not even in English), Tom Hardy's performance is mainly
dialogue driven as he provides context for pivotal points within the
film. Hardy and DiCaprio's performance go hand in hand to create a very
interesting dynamic between the two characters.The directing by Alejandro G. Innaritu is also extremely well done. The
shots and acting wouldn't have been possible without his brains behind
the computer. Overall, the film overstays it's welcome a bit. The two and a half hour
run time begins to become prevalent to the two hour mark. It would have
been possible to shave off some scenes like the horse sleeping scene. I
have a specific opinion that the last shot of a film is extremely
important. I believe this film wastes it's last shot and leaves a
strange taste in your mouth as opposed to the mystery it wants to leave
you with. In the end, the film is well done and well delivered with the
help of a likely Oscar winning performance from Leonardo DiCaprio and a
strong supporting cast of Tom Hardy, Domnhall Gleason, and Will
Poulter.

The Revenant, straight off the bat is a great film, the acting is
incredible with the standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio, Domhnall Gleeson
and Tom Hardy in my opinion even outshining DiCaprio in some scenes.
Ultimately though the best performance was delivered by DiCaprio. It
takes place in 1820's America, following frontiersman Hugh Glass on a
journey of revenge sparked during a fur trading expedition gone wrong. The effects were astonishing as well, every shot in this film looks
like a dope screensaver, the make-up is fantastic and the film is
scored perfectly. The film is long (at 2 hrs 36 mins) and certainly
feels long but I honestly couldn't look away from the screen. It takes
realism to the next level with camera work and cinematography (being
shot with only natural light) and the violence is not clean either,
it's gritty, realistic and hard to watch but its very appropriate for
the subject matter.This film is also very respectful in it's portrayal
of native Americans. All in all the pure devotion to this film really shines through due to
the hard work of the passionate cast and crew, DiCaprio's devotion to
this project alone is outstanding. To some this may seem long and
arduous and hard to watch due to the extreme violence and gritty,
realistic tone of the film but I found it thoroughly entertaining and
would probably watch it for the scenery alone. Great flick, psyched to
watch it again.

The Revenant takes place before the Civil War and tells the story of
frontiersman Hugh Glass, a navigator for a group of American fur
trappers. After being betrayed and left for dead, Hugh ventures through
the wilderness and endures through the beautiful yet brutal forces of
nature to seek his revenge.The direction and cinematography were excellent and were the driving
force of the film. From the very beginning, Innaritu pulls you into the
harsh world of Midwest Pre-Civil War America. If you're a fan of his
camera-work in Birdman, be prepared for more of that. Innaritu's vision
captures the right moments and details to gasp in horror and to cringe
in pain. The film often cuts to location nature shots; every shot was
absolutely beautiful. I felt like I was transported there and taking a
beautiful morning hike when I was not being mauled by a bear.Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Hugh Glass as our lead man braving through
the winter. It was almost as if the film was an advertisement to
convince the Academy to give DiCaprio his Oscar. "Look at all of this
crazy stuff he had to do this for this role! Give it to him!" Jokes
aside, DiCaprio performs the part well; his body and facial language
were well executed and helped convey the pain and wear his body endures
through the harsh winters and dangerous creatures within. I don't
believe the performance to be Oscar-worthy compared to his other roles,
because, in this film, he mostly acts in pain and suffering throughout.
There isn't much in terms of character development and depth; Innaritu
explores some of that in his flashbacks, but leaves the details subtle
and easily missed.Tom Hardy does an excellent job portraying the antagonist; he feels for
his character and, though he is portrayed as a villain, manages to make
the audience feel empathetic for him and understand his viewpoint.What surprised me was Will Poulter's emotional performance as Jim
Bridger. The emotion he conveys felt natural and tense at the right
moments, and his interaction with Tom Hardy brewed some unexpected
dynamics between the two in their respective roles.What I found the film lacking in was its story and its pacing. The plot
is very straightforward, and the form of the film presents it linearly.
We get it, there's tension and Glass wants his revenge. The story has
been told countless times in various (and better) forms. At times, the
film felt so slow because of its lack of plot. While the length of the
film helps accentuate how long Glass endures through the nature, there
are a lot of times the film focuses on the atmosphere and intensity of
the film rather than the actual plot and pacing.Overall, The Revenant is a survivor and revenge film all in one. With a
simple plot, Innaritu is able to focus on Glass' endurance and drive
through the beauty and beast of nature.

In 1971 I sat at the edge of my chair and watched in horror as actor
Richard Harris struggled to climb a tree while a grizzly bear viciously
tore at him and pulled him down. Such was the early scene in the
western film, Man in the Wilderness... and I never forgot it because it
was so very real. Now, we have a re-creation of that scene with no
tree, but so disgustingly real that it is a masterpiece of creativity
and ingenuity all by itself! I strongly recommend that you go see this
movie, even if its only because the special effects in the first
15:minutes are crafted by computer geniuses. Now, if you are the type
of person who cannot separate movie scenes from reality and are haunted
at night by flashbacks of the violent scenes then by all means stay
home! But then, let's get real...it is a fact that the European
settlers have been attacked by bears and also by American Indians...and
of course the settlers also attacked them. This is just history. The
Revenant may be a very unusual story about survival in the midst of
improbable odds but it certainly is not an impossibility. So, did it
actually happen? I believe that portions are based on facts...perhaps
not all of these unusual circumstances belong to the same individual,
but likely were each experienced by one or more people during the
1700s. I am convinced that Dicaprio's performance deserves an Oscar, if
for no other reason, because of the emotional challenges he was faced
with in portraying the character that this film is based upon. I rated
this film a ten, although it does slow down a bit upon approaching a
predictable ending.

No movie gave me such a unique and engaging thematic experience as the
Revenant did this year. Certain movies leave a viewer stuck in their
chair and speechless as the credits role. This film gave me that
feeling. The Revenant is able to take a rather simple story and turn it
into something special. This is all a testament to the direction of
AGI, great performances(especially from the leads), and quite possibly
the greatest Cinematography I've ever seen from the Legend Emmanuel
Lubezki. To begin, I could start boasting that I think this movie should win
almost every category at the Academy Awards but I feel like I would be
wasting my time. Anyone who sees The Revenant can simply agree. Rather,
I'd like to dive into the direction of this movie. AGI has once again
created jaw-dropping shots as he did in his prior film. After seeing
the way he shot Birdman I thought he would never once again achieve
such an accomplishment. However, he once again leaves me in awe of the
way he directed this movie. I feel like I'm experiencing these events
instead of Leo DiCaprio. I feel like I'm the one breaking
bones,freezing, swimming through rapids, etc. The Revenant almost feels
like it is being watched as found footage or a documentary. Next, let's talk about the performances. Everyone brought there best
selves for this one. It would be injustice if I didn't mention Will
Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson. They simply deliver some of the best work
of their young careers. These solid performances are often overshadowed
by some of the best actors of our generation. Those two actors being
Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio. Tom Hardy plays the villainous John
Fitzgerald who carries majority of the dialogue in this film. Every
performance Mr. Hardy does, he seems to out do himself and this one is
no different. He deliverers his normal bad ass self while then bringing
in an almost Jeff Bridges sounding Texas accent. Tom Hardy creates a
very selfish and disturbingly understanding character. Then as always,
the one and only Leonardo DiCaprio is the lead in this film as Hugh
Glass. It's almost sickening to watch the torture and pain that he goes
through in this film. At this point it does not matter if he wins an
Academy Award because everyone knows and loves him. That is because
every audience member gets lost in the character he plays and forgets
that it is Leo DiCaprio. With minimal dialogue, he is able to create
the best performance I have seen all year. The physical acting in this
movie is what creates the empathy and tragedy of this character. Hugh
Glass is of American Legend and so should this performance of Leonardo
DiCaprio. Emmanuel Lubezki better known as Chivo creates quite possibly the most
beautiful scenery I have ever seen. This movie is shot all in natural
light and I don't think enough people realize how hard that is. They
only had an hour and a half a day to shoot the scenes they wanted. It
may have been hard work but The Revenant is not as special as it is if
the cinematography is not this good. It is injustice to this film if it
is not seen on the big screen. When I say it feels like live events
being watched, that is because of the beauty and harshness that is able
to be captured through the wilderness.Besides a rather simple story, The Revenant is a near masterpiece. This
is something special and one of the best cinematic experiences anyone
can have. Everyone involved in this film, thank you for all the harsh
work you put in; you have produced something special that will be
talked about for decades to come.

This movie would be a perfection if the audience are unaware of the
magic that Inarittu can produce in his movies....movies like Birdman
would be a great example... Still this movie did really amaze me with
scenes like the bear attack and the ending scenes.. Leonardo Dicaprio
did great as usual, but what is really important is Tom's performance
because his performance shows us how much he has grown up as an actor
since the days of Inception. As a big Leornardo Dicaprio fan I would
recommend this movie before watching it myself, but now that I have
watched it I can say it with lots of confidence that you will not be
disappointed...

The Revenant is directed by Alejandro Iñárritu and is based on the true
events of an nineteenth century fur trapper named Hugh Glass (Leonardo
Dicaprio) and his epic tale of redemption. After he is savagely
attacked by a grizzly bear, Hugh must be taken care of by his fellow
expeditioners, which proves to be hard. After his team leader accepts
that he is just a burden, he pays three men to stay behind and take
care of him, while the rest push on forward. The three men that stay
behind are Hugh's Native American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), a rival
of Hugh's named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), and another teenage boy named
Bridger (Will Poulter). Fitzgerald eventually murders Hugh's son,
buries Hugh alive, and takes off with Bridger, lying to him about
Hawk's fate. Then, Hugh crawls out of his early grave to seek vengeance
upon Fitzgerald.I saw this movie the day it premiered in my state, on January 8, and
walked in expecting a crappy January movie, and I was dead wrong. The
Revenant, I think, is definitely an Oscar worthy movie, and only
competition would feature Spotlight, Mad Max: Fury Road, and The
Martian. If not for those three films, The Revenant would win without a
doubt. First I'll discuss the better qualities, then I'll jump into the
negatives.To start off, this movie has literally the best cinematography in movie
history, apart from Avatar (2009). This film looks absolutely
beautiful. Some of the shots look unreal due to how amazing they look.
When Iñárritu was filming The Revenant, he refused to use any lighting
effects at all. Yes, obviously, the editing team enhanced it, but all
lighting in the film was either form the sun, the moon, or fire. That's
risky, and it worked out masterfully.Another thing was Dicaprio's acting. It genuinely makes me mad that
this man has yet to win an Oscar, but if he doesn't for this film, I'll
just be that much more mad. He has already won the Golden Globe for
best actor, but that's just not the same. Another great performance is
Tom Hardy's. Tom Hardy is already an amazing actor, but this just shows
off his skill even more. He really proves himself in this movie, and
shows that his abilities are barely below, if not on par, with the
greats like Dicaprio.A third amazing thing about the film was the script. Prior to the live
burial of Glass, there really wasn't too much dialogue throughout. It
had bits and pieces here and there, mostly between Fitzgerald and
Bridger, but there was still a large absence of lines. Some people will
complain about this, but I think it really helps the film. This movie
is supposed to be very real and wild, and in a situation like that, a
man that's alone for most of the movie wouldn't really talk too much.
So the lack of speaking really advances the film.Now there are some bad things to the movie, just like every other one.
It's main problem is the run time. The movie is good, of course, and
the plot is exciting, but the movie seemed a little too long. The movie
comes in at about 2 hours and 36 minutes. Now, personally think they
should've shaved off 15 or 20 minutes, and it would've been a bit
better. Obviously that's a small problem, but I can't say the movie's
perfect when it's not.So, overall, I would commend The Revenant for its cinematography,
acting, directing, and script. After a lot of thought, I'd give The
Revenant an A, or a 9 out of 10 stars.

"The Revenant" is Alejandro González Iñárritu's follow up to his Best
Picture Winner: "Birdman". The film was shot using natural light,
meaning that during production only a select number of hours were
available for shooting each day. The crew was put through harsh winter
conditions in pursuit of shooting the film in the most authentic way
possible. However, is this all a giant gimmick for positive word of
mouth or is this worthy of it's Best Picture nomination? I am partial
to the latter. What it excels at: * The cinematography is absolutely stunning,
utilizing long takes to fully immerse you in the frontier setting. I
was shivering in my seat. The film is a technical masterpiece, the
finest film-making of 2015. *DiCaprio dedicates himself entirely to the
role. He may not have too many lines of dialogue, but he compensates
with excellent facial expressions and practical stunt work. Tom Hardy's
Fitzgerald is an enthralling antagonist, who's motives are easy to
grasp onto. * The violence is brutal and bare knuckle. No quick cuts,
No BS.Possible flaws: * The middle act can be repetitive, as it mainly
involves a chain of scenes, in which DiCaprio's character must overcome
nature's brutal conditions. * The movie has underlying themes of
revenge, religion and even capitalism. When the movie was over, it
wasn't entirely clear (to me at least) what I was supposed to be
walking away with in regards to the film's position on those themes.Who I recommend it for: Anyone who can appreciate stellar film- making
and in the mood of an exhaustive but rewarding survival adventure. If
you don't care much for beautiful landscape shots of nature, the 2nd
act may feel a but lengthy.

The Revenant is, for the most of it, DiCaprio crawling and moaning. Of
course, that gets tiring at some point. The movie could, easily, be
half an hour shorter, and that would perhaps make it more enjoyable.
But also The Revenant is a very ambitious movie. On the technical side,
it is flawless, and it uses the natural scenarios, the lights and the
sound perfectly. It is even more impressive when you know that it was
only shot with natural light! At some points it seems like the plot
(which isn't precisely noteworthy) is just an excuse for Iñárritu to
shoot a wildlife documentary, because the landscapes are truly
breathtaking, and they take a considerable amount of screen time.What is most memorable from this film is, I think, the camera
techniques. From extensively long shots depicting intense battle
scenes, to clever, smooth transitions between scenes, the use of the
camera has become something of Iñárritu's trademark. What I found most
interesting was the ways in which he breaks the fourth wall at
different points of the movie; from DiCaprio's final closeup to the
staining of the camera with the actor's breath/blood. Acting-wise,
Hardy's performance is definitely Oscar-worthy, unlike, in my opinion,
DiCaprio's (not that he is a bad actor; I just wouldn't give an Oscar
to a performance that is mostly, as I said before, moaning and
crawling).With its length, lack of dialogue, and somewhat experimental directing,
this is not the most usual Hollywood's awards season blockbuster. One
would expect the Academy to prefer more discreet dramas in the lines of
The King's Speech or Million Dollar Baby, but, who knows, maybe I'm
mistaken.

What strikes one about The Revenant is its realism. It gives the
feeling that you're actually there as the characters are (literally)
breathing unto the camera. It is a gorgeously looking movie that's a
love letter to nature. However the cinematography is almost better than
the story actually deserves.The problem is that The Revenant drags its feet. It is a two and a half
hour film and you feel it easily could have been shortened down to two
hours of even less when you look at the actual substance of the story.
Its slow movement and too many weird dream sequences can wear one's
patience down.That said if you don't mind slow moving films then The Revenant is
highly recommendable. It is a quality drama film with solid
performances. It is teeming with metaphors that will take many viewings
to decipher. The story was good, but I did not like the ending. For all
the time that it took to get there the final resolution felt quick. In
fact the movie is less satisfying the more it goes on.Overall The Revenant is a spectacle that's a visual joy, but I doubt
its for everyone. I'm not even sure whether I liked it and my high
score is due more to the film's obvious quality rather than personal
favour.

Sit back, take a deep breath and brace yourself for a 2 and a half hour
journey of the most gritty intense survival scenes you will ever
witness this year! Nature truly is a beast! The Revanant is another
visual masterpiece from the masterminds who brought us Birdman: Lubezki
and Inarritu. However this time they have moved on from black comedy to
give us a more realistic and bleak approach to a true story that
depicts the survival instincts of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) a 19th century
Fur trapper and Frontiersman. The one shot technique that made Birdman so unique is used sparingly in
The Revenant but to even greater effect, namely the opening attack
scene which is one of the most jaw dropping action scenes I have ever
witnessed in cinema. You cannot help but be impressed no matter how
pretentious you may have found the technique in Birdman. The sound and
visuals literally bring you right into the action depicted on screen.
You feel every arrow, shot and scream happening around you resulting in
a fuelled, thrilling and dare I say claustrophobic sensation.The Revenant contains some very long drawn out scenes designed to give
the viewer a mesmerising (if a little uncomfortable) watch at times.
The biggest example being the bear attack scene in which I was
clenching my teeth throughout! You could be forgiven for believing they
used a real bear at times as the use of CGI is incredible and is
nurtured in impeccable detail from it's movement and behaviour though
to the interaction with the Character.The acting is undeniably Oscar worthy from both Dicaprio and Hardy.
Dicaprio had the opportunity in this to act his absolute socks off, we
literally feel every bone crunching movement and lung shattering breath
that emerges from him after the onslaught which is hard to take at
times. Surely he's gone through enough to finally earn himself that
elusive Oscar that annually denies him but we'll have to wait and see!
Hardy as usual gives what always seems like an effortless natural
performance as Fitzgerald. He has one of those rare talents that goes
beyond acting and simply just 'becomes' his character like DeNiro used
to do in his younger years (before the joy of 'Grudge Match' and 'Dirty
Granpa!' haha) Like his portrayal of Bane you can't understand half the
words coming out of his mouth but it doesn't seem to matter, you know
it's good! ;)Beyond the intense brutality and dark tonal qualities of the film
however lies a layer of immense beauty. The cinematography of Lubezki
is overwhelmingly gorgeous and illustrates the natural surroundings in
all it's glory giving an almost hypnotic feel to the film, one that is
more than welcome to the viewer.However, in all it's visual beauty and intense action scenes the story
and screenplay leaves a little more to be desired and this is where I
believe the movie falls short. The taglines and discussions will have
you believe this is a great revenge story and they wouldn't be entirely
wrong, however the revenge plot feels a little forced (possibly to give
the main character even more motivation for his actions) and the
relationship with his native son lacks emotion. The real emotion of the
film comes from Glass' willingness to survive under the harshest of
circumstances and his relationships with some of the Ankara natives he
interacts with along the way. Sadly there is not enough screen time
between him and his son to draw up a real bond for the viewer to care
about and it's this problem that lets down the last 20mins of the film
no matter how intense Inarritu makes them.Having said that the movie hosts an incredibly haunting soundtrack,
GRIPPING visuals and brilliant performances through out to make this
movie a must see at the cinema. Some may not have the stomach to give
it a second viewing but I personally would go see this again. Looking
forward to Inarritu's next project. :)

The performances were excellent (Di Caprio does deserves the Oscar this
time), the pictures and filming were awesome and everything in general
about this movie was "correct". But the plot just wasn't for me. In the
second this movie started, I wanted it to end; and since I was watching
it online, I watched it at 20-minutes intervals. Boring is not the
right word, and I feel like this movie wasn't exactly slow. I think my
problem with The Revenant is that I didn't care. I didn't care about
what was going on or what was going to happen, because I simply didn't
feel attached neither to the story or to the characters. I like action
movies, but not when the only thing that happens is basically our main
character struggling in the edge of the death for TWO HOURS. I just
needed more plot, something interesting going on, and not just Di
Caprio making pain faces and surviving in un-human, impossible and
almost ridiculous ways. I couldn't relax or actually get into the story
during the hole movie. ¿Awesome performances? Yes! Good pictures and
scenarios? Of course! It deserves the Oscar's nominations? I guess so.
It was "correct", and I actually don't regret even for a second
watching this movie, it's obvious all the hard work that is behind The
Revenent and the watching is worth it just for that. But yeah... like I said before: not my kind of movie.

I've gone camping. I've seen bears. I watched Backcountry and I'm
sorry, but this film does not meet expectations. I don't believe the
entire story is true. Realistically speaking, the injuries sustained by
Leo D's character throughout the movie (let alone the bear attack),
would have been fatal, especially in the 1830's! Leonardo DiCaprio is a
decent actor, however he was not the right one for this character. It
seemed the whole cast was off a bit; but then again, the character
development was seriously lacking. I watched this movie without
judgement, with an open mind. Unfortunately, it didn't pan up and I was
genuinely disappointed.

I will concede a 7 for visual,the story a 5 ,the dialogue a 3 ,and the
ridiculous goofs a 2 ,for instance the number of times a man on the
verge of frost bite happily splash into freezing cold water makes the
film just stupid,plus. Best actor really ? why what acting did De Cap
actually have to do,apart from lying down in the snow and then leaping
to his feet on any number of occasions. How many viewers really cared
what happened ? I just wanted it to end.The tired story of old two men
stabbing each other but then carrying on scrapping as though they have
been attacked with a feather duster. O.K visually magnificent ,Oscar
potential ,2016 scraping the bottom of the barrel now.

The story of Hugh Glass and his survival through the cold winter is
amazing. It's a strong and powerful story, and it was crazy to watch. The cinematography - done by Emmanuel Lubezki - was absolutely over the
top. Everything was filmed perfectly and it had some amazing shots,
especially with Leonardo DiCaprio. But it shouldn't surprise anyone
that Lubezki can do something so well. Anyway, the plot is a bit thin,
but it shouldn't have been done differently, because I'm a fan of
sticking to the real story as much as possibly, and Alejandro Iñárritu
did a great job at changing small things about the story, so that it
would fit a movie - maybe an Oscar- winning movie, who knows?Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are absolutely flawless in this one. I
couldn't recognize Hardy at all. If I hadn't know it was him from the
beginning, I wouldn't have known. They played their roles so well, and
even though there wasn't a lot of talk, and most of the conversations
was foreign, it still worked because the actors did their part on
showing us what they felt without saying anything.It's a very strong movie, and there's not a lot of happy, fluffy
feeling in it - just to let you know. It's an action movie about death
and survival and races. It's beautifully done, and the costumes are
amazing, and the make-up even better. You'll definitely miss something
by not watching it.

This is a movie that a lot of people are going to remember, talk, and
think about for a very long time. One of those movies that makes it
hard to think about anything else for the next several hours. Its an
incredible true story that speak about so much more than the story
itself. I know that sound pretentious but this is a really really deep
movie and its hard to talk about it at all without sounding at least a
little pretentious. This movie blew me away in so many ways and I
really don't want to say too much about it because you know what its
generally about and its best that you go into it with what you already
know and just watch it. Like seriously though go watch it.

The one thing that really got me thinking upon completing this film is,
how did DiCaprio know that this was going to be a good movie? I can't
imagine anything about the script would cause an A list actor to jump
on the role. It's essentially a vengeance type film (someone
wronged/killed you or your family)... this film adds the extra element
that the hero has to achieve this while being on deaths door and has to
drudge through insanely beautiful terrain to do it. Also to note, the
bear attack scene is unbelievable! It's the best CGI I've ever seen.
Anyways, did DiCaprio go to a psychic, or maybe I'm just missing
something? I would love to know what caused him to choose this role? I
can imagine he wanted the challenge of doing something different from
anything he had ever done before. With one of the big challenges in
this role being very little dialogue and having to rely on facial
expressions etc. Very difficult role and he was excellent as always
(I'm not sure if this will get him the best actor nomination, but it
may). I can imagine one of the motivating factors was, Dicaprio had
just completed Wolf of Wall street, which I wouldn't be surprised if it
holds the record for the most dialogue for a character in the history
of cinema. So DiCaprio now jumps completely on the opposite side of the
spectrum in this film. Overall this movie is worth the watch for most people. As I said, the
plot is very simple, but the visuals are perfect. Some nit picks, which has spoilers. Watching the hero of the film
drudge around in constant pain gets to be kind of draining. I can take
it for a little bit, but dude! And when Hugh (Dicaprio) eventually
catches up to the villain dude... I understand they want to make it
suspenseful, but to me it comes across really lame and cheesy when
everything for the most part had taken the straight arrow realistic
movie style to that point only for it to result in your typical hero
meets villain final fight scene, with back and forths with both people
getting stabbed and beat etc. Hugh had been spot on with the gun up
until the final scene where he grazes the villain at point blank range.
Now we get to watch Hugh take more abuse...oye very!!! I would have
rather the suspense revolve around the villain breaking away from Hugh
to were it seems as though he just might be home free only for Hugh to
do something drastic in order to find him and/or catch up with him. No
need for corny back and forths.

There is a scene in this movie where a rider and his horse fall off the
cliff. A healthy horse. And a sick, bear mauled, hungry barely
surviving rider. Surprise! the horse dies and the rider survives. A man
is shown to catch fish with bare hands, eat raw buffalo, go hungry for
days. And he still survive fairly strong and able. There is no
emotional connect that the audience is able to develop with the
characters. The key villain is the only realistic character. Also,
annoyingly the protagonist keeps remembering a line by his dead wife
all through the movie about how branches shake but not the stem. This
line finds no meaning whatsoever in the drama. Still this line is
repeated like 10 times. Its such a silent screenplay I fell asleep
twice.

The scenes in this movie are breathtaking, when you see Hugh Glass
crawling in the wilderness, you tend to ignore Hugh for a moment and
look at the picture perfect scene. Alejandro G. Iñárritu made a movie,
again relying not solely on the actors but on every other ingredient
which helps make a movie great. I am not sure why Leo was casted, any
other actor would have been as great since there were not much of
dialogues. But then again, actors like Leo can help give a movie good
opening but the rest of course depends on the movie itself. Anyways,
coming to the movie, i did not find anything great in the movie except
the scenes which were of course natural. The pace is slow may be too
slow, the story is okay but nothing great. Flashbacks failed to elicit
any emotions other than again slowing down the movie. Leo will finally
win an Oscar for the movie i think but personally i would have imagined
him winning an Oscar for a movie like Aviator or The departed which
were based on the actors and without the actors those movies become
weak. But this movie is not based on actors really, we could replace
the whole cast of the movie and i feel we will still get the same
result..... In short, it was not what i expected it to be.......

I thought the first 40mins was excellent! The cinematography was
excellent, such beautiful shots. Unfortunately the cinematography
greatly supports my 7 rating, which might tell you what I think of the
story. One can easily watch the first 40mins and the last 20mins and
not really miss anything. Aside from the disaster, "The Lone Ranger",
I've never complained about a movie's length... but here it is, "The
Revenant" is an hour too long - the good thing is there's plenty of
opportunity to go to the bathroom and grab popcorn without missing
anything. I'm not sure why the movie has all the hype, unless you're
into 90mins of a guy limping along finding shelter and something to
eat. Best Actor? Really? I love DiCaprio, but this was far from his
best role to date. The character didn't have the foundation for an
Oscar nod in my opinion, and it would have been relatively easy for
MANY actors to turn in a similar performance. I suspect there once was
a compelling script here that was greatly tarnished my another writer
or director's theme emphasis which resulted in numerous scenes that
didn't add to the story, thus causing it to drag - like DiCaprio
through the snow.Sorry. It only deserved one Oscar nod. Having said that, there are
phenomenal individual scenes, and the cinematography is worthy of the
big screen - so go see it. At least it's original and not a franchise
sequel.

Firstly, the acting in this film cannot be questioned, Dicaprio, the
underrated performance( in my opinion) of Tom hardy, Will Poulter and
Domhnall Gleeson really bring alive what in fact is a simple,
predictable script and formulaic story. The latter of which cannot be
complained about as you must surely have a grasp on how the film will
finish going in, with Dicaprio(Hugh Glass) finding and killing( or
serving on a plate) Hardy(John Fitzgerald) in a brutal fight to the
death which was beautifully shot and captured. It is the way this film is captured that makes it Oscar bait and thus a
12 time nominated picture. With Inarriru and Lubezki choosing to shoot
with natural light, in real locations, with some of the long takes that
were so brilliantly seen in Birdman. Coupled with the engineering of an
avalanche, the brutal almost life like bear attack and the actors
willingness to push themselves that really take the film to another
level than you'd expect from what is basically a 19th century Hollywood
action movie with a 140 million dollar budget.I was expecting the film to probably stand still at points and
basically be time filling between the brutal battles at the beginning
and end of the film, with basically just 2 hours of Dicaprio
demonstrating his acting skills. However I was surprised at the amount
of on screen time for both Hardy and Poulter who formed an interesting
relationship on screen and I believe saved the audience from watching
Hugh glass drag himself across the floor for 2 hours+, as we know
Dicaprio has a talent for such a task(flashback to the Wolf of Wall
Street) and I believe credit has to go to Inarritu for focusing not
just on Glass and his remarkable story but allowing us to also revel in
Hardy's performance, which I believe is his best to date and worthy of
winning the supporting actor race. While Leonardo Dicaprio's
performance cannot be denied and as much as he deserves recognition and
will probably win best actor, I don't believe it's his best or in fact
as commendable as Michael Faabender's effort in Steve jobs. I imagine we will not see a film that feels so real and on a scale of
this magnitude for some time and it is nice to see an era of real live
action sequences (without CGI, minus the bear) beginning to emerge once
again with this and of course Mad max Fury Road, which is why I believe
people should look past the predictable nature of the script and see
the epic scale of what Inarritu and Lubezki persevered for years to
create.

My God.It has been years,since i have seen something so INTENSE and
CHILLING in a Cenima.I have seen some really amazing movies by Leonardo Dicaprio but nothing
like this.In my opinion, this is by far THE BEST of all of the Dicaprio
Movies.Everything from blood,gun powder,flesh,meat,animals,wounds,
stitches,scars (Even the special effects), all looks and feels RAW.The whole cinema was quiet throughout the movie except the times when
something intense came up.And there are many scenes that will make your
jaw drop.The attention to detail, authenticity and realism is next to
perfect.Leonardo Dicaprio does not deserve one, but more then one Oscars.It's a
SHAME how Hollywood is biased towards him . Especially after this
masterpiece of a Movie , he deserves something more then just an Oscar.

The Revenant satisfied all my senses on levels beyond my wildest
imagination. Shot in natural light, director Alejandro Gonzalez
Inarritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (best known for his work
on Gravity and Birdman) have outdone themselves with a scope and
magnitude which I can't even begin to describe. The Revenant is raw,
placing us in the life of Hugh Glass, a frontiersman in 1820's America,
fighting for his life and seeking revenge after being left for dead.
It's violent, tense and nerve- wracking, even when there's little going
on. It never feels too long, even at 156 minutes. It starts with the
most intense scenery to grace the big screen since Saving Private Ryan.
Emmanuel Lubezki's camera ducks, dives and weaves around frontiersman
and native Indians in one, brutal battle. He takes us from one death to
another, over hills, under water, never favouring one side over the
other, and yet we're still routing for our favourites, even though
we've just met them. Leo's sublime, the hardships he ensure makes him
an awards contender. He goes through unimaginable tasks most actors
wouldn't. Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter are great
alongside him, the latter quivering his way brilliantly through the
film. I haven't come out of the cinema feeling in cold, in shock, and
mostly, in awe. The Revenant is a must see on the big screen.

I mean,Leo has always been a great actor. But in my opinion I don't
know why this movie is up for an Oscar. It's like 90 percent Leo
walking through the forest looking for Tom Hardy. So entertaining.
Takes a lot of acting chops to actually act like you're in a lot of
pain after getting attacked by a bear but I really felt like a good
portion of the movie was just filler. Tom and Leo going at each other
though, that's a good fight. Also what's up with the naked guy shooting
a horse out of the blue? I didn't get that. All in all I thought the
movie was just meh. For me, nothing to write home about. Like I said,
mostly Leonardo just walking through the woods and grunting.

In 1823, a party of trappers under the command of Captain Andrew Henry
hunt for pelts in the unsettled wilderness of the northern Louisiana
Purchase. When Arikara Native Americans launch a surprise attack on the
party's camp, many of the trappers are slaughtered and the survivors
flee on a boat. At the recommendation of the party's guide and most
experienced hunter Hugh Glass, who has knowledge of the area and
natives, they abandon the boat and begin the journey back to their
outpost, Fort Kiowa, on foot. The decision bothers some, particularly
John Fitzgerald, who is hostile towards Glass's half-native son Hawk,
as he was partially scalped by natives years prior.While scouting ahead, Glass is ambushed by a grizzly bear after
disturbing her cubs. He manages to kill her but is badly mauled; the
party discover him close to death and carry him on a makeshift
stretcher. Fitzgerald argues that Glass will not survive his injuries
and that they should kill him to speed their journey. Unable to kill
Glass, Henry offers payment for several men to stay behind with him
instead. Fitzgerald, Hawk and the young Jim Bridger volunteer. Henry
has Fitzgerald promise to stay with Glass until he dies and give him a
proper burial.Once alone with Glass, Fitzgerald reveals his intention to smother him.
Claiming that it will save Hawk, Fitzgerald pressures Glass into
compliance. However, Glass watches helplessly as Hawk arrives during
the act only to be killed in the ensuing struggle. When Bridger
returns, Fitzgerald says Hawk is missing, and Glass is too injured to
protest. Later, Fitzgerald lies that the Arikara are nearby and that
they must abandon Glass; he drags Glass into a shallow grave. Bridger
hesitates but flees with Fitzgerald, leaving Glass with his canteen.
Glass crawls out of the grave and walks through the woods for days,
haunted by visions of his deceased Native wife. He escapes the Arikara,
whose chief is searching for his kidnapped daughter Powaqa, by floating
down rapids.On their way to Fort Kiowa, Bridger realizes that Fitzgerald lied, but
Fitzgerald intimidates him into silence. When they arrive at the fort,
Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass succumbed to his wounds and that Hawk
was likely attacked by the Arikara. Henry pays Fitzgerald his reward,
but Bridger refuses payment.Glass encounters Hikuc, a friendly Pawnee who shares bison meat with
him. Hikuc too has lost family, but says that "revenge is in the
Creator's hands." The two travel together on horseback, and Hikuc
builds Glass a shelter during a blizzard. Glass wakes to find Hikuc
hanged by a group of French pelt hunters. He infiltrates the camp and
sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills two hunters, and
retakes Hikuc's horse, leaving behind Bridger's canteen. He encounters
the Arikara again and escapes by galloping off a cliff, killing the
horse and injuring himself further. He survives the night by sheltering
inside the horse's carcass.At Fort Kiowa, a lone hunter arrives carrying Bridger's canteen.
Believing it was stolen from Hawk, Henry organizes a search party and
leaves to find him. Fitzgerald, realizing that Glass is alive, steals
the fort's money and escapes. Henry's search party discovers Glass and
brings him to the fort. Furious, Henry charges Bridger with treason,
but Glass assures Henry that Fitzgerald lied to him. Glass insists on
joining Henry to find Fitzgerald. After they split up while tracking
him, Fitzgerald ambushes Henry. Glass finds him dead and scalped.By pretending to be dead, Glass ambushes Fitzgerald and shoots him in
the shoulder. He chases him into the woods and they engage in a bloody
fight on a river bank. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but remembers
Hikuc's words and pushes him downstream into the hands of the Arikara.
The chief, accompanied by Powaqa, scalps and kills Fitzgerald but
spares Glass. Glass walks away and collapses. He has a vision of his
wife, who smiles at him before disappearing into the woods. You peoples should watch this movie.It was phenomenal 10/10!!.

If you wanted to watch heavy breathing for 2h and 36mins you got your
movie over here. ended up watching clock after every 10mins because i
got bored during first 40mins of the movie... probably ruined my
enjoyment by watching the trailer as that was 80% of the good parts
from the movie. Too long wouldn't watch again. I Would suggest it to
people who like to watch this year new heavy breathing simulator though
if you came here for action you are in wrong spot. Most of the dialogue
is missing as well due to the heavy breathing. I Have seen many other
movies where Di Caprio was perfoming but this one... I Still don't get
it why people would suggest to give this movie a Oscar. Anyways i hope
you people who didn't come here to watch Heavy Breathing Simulator 2016
i suggest to move along somewhere else.

This movie to me is another one of those movies that seek to shock the
viewer into appreciating a movie that lacks any kind of enjoyable or
believable plot line.It's just one incident followed by the next, painfully stretched over 2
and a half hours.Yes, the scenery is beautiful and frankly it would be hard to shoot
that in a way that the result wouldn't be very visually appealing. Yes,
the exclusive use of natural light makes for an interesting palette.
There's some CGI / animation involved that is very impressive.
DiCaprio's performance doesn't leave much to be desired.But the story.. is just.. terrible. And the character Tom Hardy shows
us is nothing more than a cliché stereotype meant to inspire 1990s bad
guy loathing.With the credits rolling, this movie left me puzzled how other viewers
can apparently be shocked or visually pleased into rating a movie with
a story that is predictable, long stretched, with a lot of not very
believable developments, an 8+. Doesn't story matter anymore?

I expected much but to be honest was bored. I am more than capable of
appreciating a long, largely gloomy film about existence and survival
(the road came to mind during this film and I thought that was
brilliant and very moving) but I found this film ultimately tedious.
There was no character development so I simply didn't care what
happened to Leonardo Di Caprios's character. Scene after scene started
with him face down in the snow, moaning. An internal monologue and more
of a back story might have helped. There were also many plot holes such
as the scene where he found himself above the river (at least 200 fatal
feet high) and suddenly he was down in the water. He then found himself
propelled for some time through ice-filled water which should have
killed someone with the injuries he sustained from the bear attack.
Scenes began with potential menace but then nothing happened. I checked
my phone thinking it must be nearly over and, with an hour to go,
bailed. Still don't care what the outcome was. Definitely not an Oscar
deserving performance, or film but no doubt I will be proved wrong!

The initial scene of The Revenant sets the tone of the following film
perfectly. The almost unbelievable natural beauty of the Canadian
landscape is harshly juxtaposed against the cruel artificiality of the
historical rifles which slowly move into the shot. Iñárritu perhaps
intended to represent the brutal tainting of Native American time
during the Frontier period. DiCaprio corroborated this concept whilst
accepting his Golden Globe win - briefly discussing the world's
indigenous peoples and calling on people to protect the environment
from man-made interests.One major disappointment was the title of the movie being perhaps the
biggest spoiler of all. Anyone with a dictionary or an extensive
vocabulary can, after about 20 minutes into the movie, make a likely
correct prediction about the ending of the movie. In terms of the cast, Tom Hardy further demonstrates his immense
versatility when it comes to characters - his portrayal of Fitzgerald
differs massively from his performance in 2011 Cold War Drama Tinker
Tailor Soldier Spy. Despite this, one minor downfall I personally
noticed was that it was, for myself, at some points very difficult to
understand some of Hardy's voice. However, the muttering accent of
Hardy's character arguably assists in the development of Hardy's
character, Fitzgerald. Leo DiCaprio gave an stellar performance, his
impressive prowess as an actor was proved by his ability to demonstrate
emotion despite his lack of dialogue (due to his character being
solitary for the majority of the storyline). This is perhaps best
demonstrated in an early scene, in which Tom Hardy's character is
murdering Hawk (DiCaprio's character's son) in front of a bed ridden
DiCaprio. DiCaprio represents immense emotion despite the fact that he
is essentially paralysed as a result of the bear attack. Overall, The Revenant is a stunning film, with visuals and a storyline
clearly furnishing it's categorisation in the Epic genre. The movie
furnishes a crucial visual representation of an environmental issue of
ever-increasing importance, perhaps safeguarding The Revenant's
position as a modern Frontier-film classic.

When we were young, we used to play a word game which we called
"Fortunately/Unfortunately". It was quite a straightforward game to
play, with one player setting the scene by saying something like "Doris
went to the park one day". The next player would respond by saying
"Unfortunately, as she was walking to the park, a giant girl-eating
lizard jumped out from behind a telephone box". The first player then
needed to respond by saying something like "Fortunately, it had just
eaten another girl and so it was all full up".Watching The Revenant reminded me hugely of this game. Leonardo Di
Caprio is your classic white man, Glass, who is down with the native
Americans, nursing a lost wife and looking to protect his "half-breed"
son (as he's charmingly referred to by Tom Hardy's compelling, although
somewhat garbled, villain Fitzgerald). To say Glass gets knocked back
every time he tries to step forward is underplaying the extent of the
trials and tribulations he faces.He's beaten, battered, shot at and stabbed, dunked in ice cold water,
dragged through snow, and yet he still keeps on coming. Strangely
though, I felt that the director manages to keep things just about
credible and the unfortunate events never dawdled or overstayed their
welcome, and despite its length, this movie keeps your interest
throughout. The camera-work really is astounding, a dizzying whirl that
plonks the viewer right at the epicentre of the action. The landscapes
and light are really to die for, it's a gorgeous visceral experience
throughout and really is a feast for sore eyes.Hardy's characterisation of Fitzgerald was, for me, the standout
performance, even if some of his dialogue is so broad as to be more or
less incoherent. However, the brooding sense of malice and unrestrained
anger he transmits with a raised eyebrow or a steely-eyed look is
astounding. Di Caprio by comparison says very little, for the very good
reason that his throats been slashed, leading to a mild moment of
humour when he desperately tries to drink some clean water. Which very
quickly then transmutes into yet another gory scene that makes you
squirm. And that happens frequently throughout.The plotting and narrative are probably the weakest elements of the
production, however, and some of the events felt slightly too pat and
contrived to truly hit the roof. The dream sequences in particular
didn't add a great deal to the overall package although I can see why
they were included. Especially if you go away and read about the actual
Hugo Glass, you wonder why Iñárritu and co needed to invent some of the
story in the way that they did when the real-life story sounded quite
compelling in the first place. However, those are petty complaints
really and I have to say, this is well worth spending two and half
hours of your time.Unfortunately, I had a bad back on the day that I went to see it.
Fortunately, I completely forgot about it whilst watching this movie,
it was that good.

Leonardo DiCaprio WILL do whatever it takes to win an Oscar. He'll get
mauled by a grizzly bear, get buried alive, limp and crawl his way out
of being buried, gut and sleep inside a horse a la Empire Strikes Back,
and even do hand to hand combat with Mad Max himself. Guys, give the
man his Oscar, or else he'll probably crucify himself with hot steel
bars and barbed wires, before getting stabbed in the side with a
harpoon by the Antichrist in the bowels of hell (or Indiana in June) to
the irritating sounds of Pentatonix!Not to any disservice to The Revenant itself, as it is a really damn
good movie, and I really want to give special mention to the makeup
department. Every gash, cut, scrape, splatter of blood, and wounds
seeping with puss look terrifyingly realistic. You see the freshest of
cuts slowly heal up and look as if they're getting infected. Combine
this with how great DiCaprio's acting is in this, and you get a scarier
feel of tension then in any horror film of recent memory. You see him
slowly transform into a survivalist savage who's in constant pain. You
never see Leonardo DiCaprio, but rather Hugh Glass, the character he
plays.Another mention goes to the director, Alejandro González Iñárritu, for
how well he shows us such breathtaking and beautiful views of the
frozen points of Canada to visually tell a story. Many points that lack
dialogue are well done, especially when combined with DiCaprio's
physical acting ability and the musical composition. It's a real match
made in heavenThe Story, however, is the weakest part of the film. "The Revenant" is
loosely based off the Michael Punke novel of the same name. I never
read it, but I'm sure there were many deviations from it, as this is
solely a survival film that has some generic revenge plot against a
racist villain jumbled in, almost like a delicious bacon and chicken
sandwich with melted Hagen Daz on top. It just feels forced and out of
place, and it really dumbs down Tom Hardy's character to just another
Clayton from Tarzan, only now he has a son that's that annoying ginger
from "We're The Millers" and "The Maze Runner"It doesn't really matter, since the visuals, acting, and composition
save the film from being a mess. It's an easy recommendation for those
who love a good survival film, and to everyone else should at least
give it a look. It's a really good one.

This movie opened on Christmas Day and was the perfect holiday movie.
Leonard DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for his performance in this movie-it
might be his best film ever I think. Tom Hardy played the arch enemy of
LD's character-which TH also did very well. I have not seen a bad guy
like that on screen for some time-maybe never. The historical aspect of
the movie was handled well-you really got a sense they were back in the
1820's. The film was apparently based on a book but I have never come
across the book they are talking about. I really cannot say anything
negative about this movie because I think that so far it is the most
accurate film dealing with the subject of pioneer America. Go see
it-you won't be disappointed. I think it will do well in terms of long
term sales if it isn't knocking them dead at the box office right
now-it will probably sell a lot of DVD's over time and become a 'new
classic movie.' It deserves to be one.

Stunning! I couldn't believe how intense and captivating this movie was
from start to finish. The cinematography was breathtaking, and the use
of solely natural light was. It left me speechless. It's refreshing to
see all of that hard work pay off for the cast and crew. Chivo's
photography was breathtaking, making me want to visit the areas in
Canada and the western United States in which the film was shot. The
sound mixing and score were equally chilling. All around a numbing
cinematic experience. Now someone give Leo an Oscar, and possibly Tom
Hardy as well!Out of all the Oscar Best Pictures I have viewed this
year, this one seems to be the obvious front-runner.

Inarritu's work - 11 out of 10.Di Caprio's work - 8 out of 10. This move proved that he is better (if
not the best) at portraying "urban" characters.Script - could be better, nothing special.Tom Hardy's work - this is what ruined the whole thing. His constant
overacting (and overdoing his accent) was annoying. Felt like he is
playing in a theatrical performance, rather than in a movie.Sound effects, cinematography, secondary characters were all top level.
Tweak the script and replace Hardy, and this movie would have made a
distinctive mark in the history.

It was so bad and incredible boring. Nominated for 12 Oscar including
best Picture, actor and director? To be honest the beginning of the
Movie was not that bad. A Little reminder of Saving private Ryan. But
then it goes downhill. Alejandro Inarritu was the director- was a
director really necessary? I cant even begin to describe how bad it
was. Leo Dicaprio to win an Oscar? I hope not. The acting was below
average and he was barely the actor in a leading role. He has done some
impressive acting earlier in his career, but this performance nominated
for best actor (and he will probably win) is crazy. To sum it up: Boring Movie, poor script, bad directing and the worst
acting i've seen in a long time. He said something weird in a strange
language once in a while, grunting and slept in a dead horse. Not
Oscar-worthy!! DO NOT SE THIS PIECE OF CR*P!

The only reason I give it a one (instead of a zero), is the educational
aspect of the bear scene. Once you see the grizzly cubs, it is already
too late. Glass should have been making as much noise as possible while
walking in the woods. The scenery was also fantastic (both the lush and
bleak scenes), but you could see that with a search online for "scenic
forest wallpapers". The story was boring, predictable (when the canteen
is framed with the swirl showing, you just know it will the be
"tell-tale heart" later in the movie; and then when Glass drops it in
the snow while fleeing, my mind said BINGO.A final note, was it really necessary to break the fourth wall at the
end of the movie. "Hey, look at me Oscars, I really want that statue."
Re-watch "The Bear" if you need a real dose of North American
Wilderness scenery and want a story to go with it.

The landscape and intensity of some scenes make the movie. Directed in
quite a realistic way and with some very good and interesting
historical details.But as for the directing itself and story, it's no good.The story ends up being very Hollywood not believable for a second.The directing is so so so so slow that becomes boring. I understand
that the speed of the movie tries to reflect the loneliness and
isolation of the places, but it went waaaaaay to far.At the end of 1h30 of movie I was done, and there was still another
hour to watch. It was boring and painful. Try to watch it at home where
you can stop and keep watching some other time, or just go fast froward
in many many places.

"This film is boring because he is crawling around and grunting for 3
hours. But the cinematography is good, tho." Geez. Go back to your over-hyped cookie cutter Hollywood bullshit with
lots of unrealistic action scenes and childish jokes. Yes, this movie
is slow, and there isn't much of a story going on. Yes, the most part
of Leonardo DiCaprio's acting is crawling on the ground and grunting.
And yes, the cinematography is outstanding.The point of this film is showing the struggle the protagonist has to
go through to get his revenge, and I think the movie delivered this
point in a brilliant way. Your lack of patience doesn't make a movie
bad. But that seems to be the crowd nowadays. They want a 90 minute
cliché film with a lot of action, boobs, funny lines and a
"mind-blowing" plot twist at the end.Also, saying that DiCaprio was only crawling and grunting shows that
you people have no idea about acting. He didn't talk much, and that
makes this character even harder to portray: with facial expressions.
I'm not saying the performance was Oscar-worthy, but it was very good.
And the other actors, especially Tom Hardy, did a great job, too.This film is very much about atmosphere. And I'm not only talking about
the filming locations, camera work and editing, you also need some
empathy to feel what Hugh Glass must have felt. That's what makes the
movie interesting and also suspenseful. Yes, I thought that movie was
very suspenseful, believe it or not.Next thing is, of course, the camera work. The amount of absolutely
outstanding one shot scenes is amazing and shows the high
professionalism of the cast and crew. Did you guys even notice that the
whole battle scene at the beginning was ONE SINGLE SHOT? And also every
other scene in the movie lasted very long. You feel like you're in the
middle of it all. I know this is not new, but they do this on such a
high level here, it's amazing.I know this "review" reads more like a defense of the movie, but I
couldn't keep this to me after reading all the "opinions". If you don't
like slow movies, it's OK. But don't say a movie is bad or boring just
because it's slow. Assuming that being slow makes a movie bad, "Dead
Man" and "Only Lovers Left Alive" by Jim Jarmush are also bad movies,
right?

In the Eighteenth Century, in Louisiana, a group of fur hunters under
the command of Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) is attacked by
Arikara Indians and the few survivors escape by boat through the
Mississippi. The experienced hunter Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who
knows the area since he was married with an Indian and lived with her
in her tribe, feels that the Arikara are following the boat and tells
that it is better off hiding the fur and walk along one week to their
fort through the mountains. However Glass stumbles with a grizzly bear
and is severely wounded before killing it. He is carried in a stretcher
and the hunter John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) suggests killing him since
he is near-death, but Henry offers an amount to the man that stays with
him. Glass's Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and the teenager
Bridger (Will Poulter) offer to stay and Fitzgerald, attracted by the
award, also volunteers to stay. However he tries to kill Glass and
stabs to death Hawk. When Bridger that was fishing returns, Fitzgerald
lures him telling that twenty Arikara are coming and he does not know
where Hawk is, forcing Bridger to leave Glass behind. Now Glass begins
his dangerous journey of returning alone to the fort seeking revenge
against Fitzgerald. "The Revenant" is an original, fascinating, brutal and realistic film
with another great performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. Supported by
wonderful landscapes and the music score of Ruiji Sakamoto, the viewer
does not feel the 156 minutes running time in a perfect pace balancing
drama and adventure. The scene of the struggle between Glass and the
grizzly bear is impressively real and mesmerizing. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Regresso" ("The Return")

What kind of movie is this? Under all the grim yet starkly beautiful
exterior scenery, there is a conventional story. Although the story is
set in the western US of the 1830s, which at the time was wilderness,
the movie plays more like an action comic. The main character is
indestructible and his nemesis, named Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy,
comparably sinister (although far less intelligent). Nothing kills the
main character, whose name is Glass, played by Leonardo De Caprio. He's
shot, mauled, stabbed, starved, frozen, beaten, buried alive, caroms
over waterfalls, and lives. And if that isn't enough, he is also
cajoled, belittled, humiliated, and mocked without lapsing into
despair. This is stretching literary license to the limit. It also
takes away whatever suspense there may be as to how the story will end.
If an enraged grizzly bear and aggressive Native Americans can't kill
him, you know that the bad guy doesn't have a chance. It's just a
matter of time. So, the ending of the movie is a foregone conclusion.
De Caprio is good as Glass, the man with a mission. He is a metaphor
for suffering and self-righteous anger. (Why he is angry will not be
revealed here. For that, watch the movie.) This movie shows to what
lengths a person will go to survive, at least according to Hollywood.
The problem is: we know Glass is going to survive. Regarding Tom
Hardy's performance as Fitzgerald, it's part John Wayne doing Rooster
Cogburn, part Jeff Bridges doing Roy Pulsipher from R.I.P.D., with a
dose of Foghorn Leghorn filling in the rest, except nastier and dumber
(even dumber than Mr. Leghorn). There's no way that a dullard like
Fitzgerald is going to fool anyone as to his nefarious purposes. He
would have done better if he had just worn a sign saying "I am a bad
guy." Now, the movie does offer some useful tips on how to survive in
the wild. 1. According to the movie, if you happen to be stuck in the
middle of nowhere with a dead horse, that horse could still save your
life. To find out how, watch the movie. (hint: you must be familiar
with a horse's internal anatomy) 2. Never shoot an enraged grizzly
bear, stab it instead. (Apparently, for some reason, the movie maker
believes that a bullet is less effective than a knife as a weapon.) 3.
Never deny a Native American's request for a horse. It could lead to
serious problems. (But problems can be avoided if you are willing to
trade for a woman.) These are just a few of the many things this movie
teaches on how to survive in the wild. Thus, the movie provides a
useful public service.

Okay, I liked Birdman, a simple story told complexly and imaginatively.
But something was off here, no matter how well shot or how well acted,
again, (Tom Hardy is world class). I get the idea of the biblical
Revenant, a ghost, the unkillable, the undead, but it almost got funny,
like a cartoon character who is constantly beaten up, stabbed, shot,
mauled by a bear, and still doesn't die, or maybe dies but comes back
as an avenging spirit, maybe doesn't know he's dead or? It was just too
much and suffers in comparison with movies such as Jerimiah Johnson,
Aguirre - the wrath of God, McCabe and Mrs. Miller. And the whole
revenge thing is confused, the son getting killed after his wife is
killed and he is mauled by a bear after they all escaped from a major
attack!?!? And it was way too long, like Oscar contender long, no
matter how beautiful the cinematography. And boy, his healing
powers....or did he even need them if he wasn't alive, spooky/sloppy.

Was this a good film? Yes Was it because of the cast? Well I would like
to say no, but yes!Would it have been great with different actors? Good question, I think
it would have been good, but great no. Why not? Well cause for the main
reason that mister Dicaprio has put out a brilliant performance yet
again. As to Tom Hardy], well if I hate a person in a film it's usually
because he is brilliant. And yes he is, although I would like him to
loose the mad max, and batman villain voice every once in a while.
Cause the whole time you're thinking when is Bruce Wayne going to show
up to save the day.Hats off for this film and it's actors. As to Domhnall Gleeson, I
didn't realize he could do anything different than 'About Time' type of
acting, which is a marvelous film too.But as the film title reveals, the story line, it takes me and maybe
many more some time to find out if perhaps they made a misspelling
somewhere in the title. But no they didn't is that a spoiler? I don't
think so but I'll put up an alert just to be sure.

This film was purported to be a grueling shoot for all involved-
particularly DiCaprio, what I didn't expect was that it would be
similarly tough for viewers. Much like Glass's vocal abilities post
bear mauling, it's slow, strained and unpleasant.Glass undergoes every wilderness adversity known to man- plus a few we
didn't. Some of his 'survival' choices are baffling- like choosing to
gag down raw bison liver when there was a perfectly serviceable fire
four feet behind him. Everything is hard about this film- including the characters. The
effect of this is zero engagement with, or empathy for characters.
Without a genuine investment and attachment to characters, The Revanent
is simply an R-rated 'Man Vs Wild'. We voyeuristically watch DiCaprio
grunt and gnaw his way through storms, animal savaging, human savaging
and sub-zero temps that make the Antarctic look like a tropical
getaway. To survive these ordeals, he employs techniques straight out
of the Han Solo play-book, at one point climbing into a horse carcass
for warmth. I wanted desperately to connect with the story, to cheer on Hugh Glass
during his horrid plight; but, at best, I could only admire this film
on an aesthetic level. The cinematography is so awing that one can
never quite adjust or forget to admire it. It's like a gorgeous
wildlife documentary, only with human characters who lack the
likability of the usual animals roaming such films. DiCaprio gives a fine performance, although arguably Hardy's feral
Fitzgerald- while not as visceral, is more interesting and charismatic
to watch. Again, the lack of likability is a flaw in this film. There's
been endless hue and cry about Leo long being denied his Oscar. The
Revenant may well be his Oscar snagging performance. He renders Glass's
pain and suffering perfectly, but Glass is not a character we care
about. He's more like a specimen in a jar being tormented with sunlight
directed through a microscope by a 7 year old bully. Glass lacks the
'heart' and appeal typically expected of Oscar winning performances.
Glass is a character as frosty as the icy landscape. That's more of a
fault of the storyline than Di Caprio. I can't help but feel anyone who gets any level of enjoyment from this
film (gorgeous cinematography aside) and its violent content is a
psychopath, or at the very least, has an underdeveloped frontal lobe.
Halfway through the film I became restless for it to end. The stunning
vistas kept me there- but like Glass, I was relieved to be outta there!I love you Leo, but I preferred you in The Departed- or even Gilbert
Grape to this. Cinematography breathtaking: 10/10. The story and level
of engagement with characters: 4/10.

The opening scene with all the action and amazing camera work is really
good. And Leo's scene with the bear... Wow! But as the story unfolds,
and Leo finds himself alone in the wilderness, the movie becomes very
slow paced, even boring at times. Not much happens from that point on,
and what does happen you can pretty much predict ahead of time. Also,
to be honest, Leo is not doing a lot in this movie, other than
struggling, moaning, crawling, running, swimming. I mean, he does a
good job, but it is nothing special. There are still some extraordinary
scenes involving animal corpses for instance, but all in all it's an
average adventure/drama type movie.It might deserve an Oscar for best cinematography. Make-up and visual
effects are also amazing. Apart from that it really does not live up to
the hype.6/10

~~~ could be a spoiler, not sure ~~~~~~~Could have seriously spent 2.5 hrs of my life elsewhere... The movie
was one of the slowest movies that I have seen with a lot of redundant
parts excruciatingly inserted in it. I found it painfully exhausting
and after 2 hours couldn't resist opening my eyes. This movie is part of a genre which urges all viewers to view it from a
certain defined perspective without having itself carefully constructed
that perspective prior to the commencement of the actual plot. The
director and actors assume that irrespective of whatever your taste
you'll somehow comprehend their narrowly defined perspective, and view
the movie a certain way. With the intent to appeal to a particular cult
of movie-goers, the movie team does not do justice while elucidating or
construing their desired perspective to appeal to ALL audience types.
As such, for a normal viewer, the movie might appear increasingly bland
and exhausting unless he/she adheres to that extraordinary perspective
envisaged by the proponents if this movie. For a viewer like me,
excluding certain parts and themes, I wouldn't be able to differentiate
between this movie and a documentary "Richard Attenborough's- life of a
Northern explorer". While the acting was good, I would not describe it as being out of this
world. I admired Leonardo's perseverance but it was not in anyway
unprecedented and did not enthrall me. Tom Hardy's accent is very hard
to understand, especially if you are not American, and sounds almost
nonsensical and superfluous in many parts of the movie.The only elements I truly appreciated were the themes associated with
atrocities towards native Americans and the well captured natural
sceneries. But again, this does not in itself make a movie
extraordinary.I will never be watching this movie again in my
lifetime..

After reading the plot it seems to be an adaptation of the movie, "Man
in the Wilderness" starring Richard Harris, who while moving overland
with a boat in tow is attacked by a bear. Upon hearing the attack the
boat crew kills the bear. However, the scout, Zacary Bass, played by
Harris, is severely mauled,and near death. The Captain leaves two crew
members to bury him when he dies. Because he is slow in dying the two
crew members become impatient and decide to kill and bury him but
neither has the courage to do so. They agree that he is near death and
will not survive the day so they place him in a shallow grave and bury
him alive. Bass escapes from the grave and he struggles for survival
among the various Indian tribes and eventually is well enough to track
the Captain and crew to seek revenge for the way he was treated. It is
rare that an adaptation receives the reviews this movie is generating.
Is it because there is a whole new generation of movie goer who are not
aware that this film is an apparent copy of a good entertaining film
that also had a great star? Because of its lack of originality I did
not deem the movie beyond a 3 star. Leonardo DiCaprio, I am sure is
superb in the movie and it will be entertaining but I won't waste my
time or money to see it in the theater but rather wait for it to appear
on DVD or TV. I am sure other "critics" will have a differing view but
it is what it is.

Went to watch this movie after reading other online reviews. Found it
really boring, long full of BS. I would put this one in the same
category as Unbroken and Birdman. This movie as hard to watch as it is
to pronounce its Director's name. Stay away if you are not the intellectual types and actually looking
for some entertainment from the movie. Leonardo as always is awesome.I agree with some of the positive reviews that the movie is like a
visual poetry, where you can actually hear every detail and the
shooting in amazing picturesque location gave it unparalleled scenery
but I think its made purely for over entitled audiences and award show
judges.

I agree with several other writers that this movie turns out to be a
disappointment to the exception of the cinematography...i truly don't
believe that Di Caprio should get an Oscar for this performance which
in view of the plot could have been done by any stupid super-hero type
actor like chuck Norris, Steven Seagall, Jean-Claude Van Damme, this is
way too unreal for being a good movie in my book...but since everybody
seems to be under the opinion that Leo deserves an Oscar for his
career, he may very well get it for this one, i think it would be sad,
he has done much better movie performances, for example his
performances in "The great Gastby and Django Unchained, or Inception or
even Catch me if you can are much better without a doubt. Enjoy anyway
if you watch it...

Here's a film that has almost no redeeming qualities. It spends much
too much time with "in your face" symbolism or dwelling on gruesome
pictures of wounds, dead carcases, bleeding sores, etc. There is one
mishap after another, which might make for great reading but which
makes for a boring film. After all, this isn't survivorman, and even
that is better than this. Really, How many ways can Leonardo get hurt?
Shot, stabbed, fall off a mountain, get hit in the head,... OH, and did
I mentioned, get mauled by a bear.Now imagine Leonardo in a fight with Tom Hardy? What are the chances
that Leonardo, on the best day of his life, could take Hardy, on the
worst day of his life? What a big disappointment. If you want a good film about trappers, try
Jeremiah Johnson or Centennial. This film is a big big loser.

After waiting months to watch this and being very excited I feel really
let down. Yeah, it was OK but not the epic story and acting that I
thought it would be. I was ready for some Leo magic but it just didn't
happen...first 30 minutes were great then it just went seriously
downhill. It's all about the cinematography in this film and that's
all. I really wanted this to be a fantastic film with amazing acting
but that just didn't happen. Leo just came across as a boy
(again...Titanic) - not the brilliant actor as in Wolf. I'm currently
watching the hateful eight and it's not much better...really
disappointed. Let's hope eddy redmayne in The Danish Girl is
better...that's next on the list.

I am going to keep this short. The scenery and cinematography is
amazing. The movie is predictable. If you enjoyed "Cast Away" then you might like this movie. Revenant comes down to a movie with few characters, minimal dialogue
and a predictable story.My recommendation is to torrent this movie. Do not pay to see this!Scenery = 10 The rest = -1 Score = 4I can not come up with a 10 line review for this terrible movie. I
understand that IMDb just wants quality but Revenant is just so bad it
does not deserve ten lines of positive or negative text.

Whatever may be the rating, the one thing all should agree is "There is
no story"One side it was absolutely realistic, showing real blood, real light,
flesh, death arrows. OK greatOther side, its absolutely ridiculous. A guy who was cut open from head
to toe, swims across freezing water, eats and sleeps, no infection, no
disease and stays strong enough to take revenge.Come on, what kind of story is this? I literally puked in many scene.
really do you have to show that much blood and flesh in a movie which
has a top cast like Di caprio?? It is not a war movie and the violence
is not at all necessary in this movie.The crew suddenly vanished once for all and Tom hardy just escapes
every one.Seriously, are all other soldiers that lame to let a single
man escape ??Serious disaster. Not a good movie to watch with family.If you get to
see the rated version DVD, 25% of the movie will be gone in censor.

This movie suffered and I suffered watching it. It suffered from
repeated cliché after cliché after cliché. The characters were all one
sided "bad man is bad", "good man is good", "son is ...a son", etc.Visually this movie looks amazing. Major props to the props department!
I saw the trailers for this movie and thought 'wow, that looks cool!'
and I was DEEPLY wrong. This movie was cringe worthy bad about
rehashing all of the old tropes of the exact same movies like it. At no
point did I truly not know where it was going or who was going to
succeed in any goals any characters might have. I was even able to
predict who would die ahead of time, I won't spoil anything because I
don't have to. When you see the movie you'll say to yourself 'welp that
guy's gonna die now' and he will EVERY TIME YOU SAY THAT.You can go ahead and watch the movie for yourself but I'm just saying
it's not worth 2 and half hours of your time, your time is precious I'm
sure. I hate that this movie was bad, I wanted it to be good constantly
while watching it but it just wasn't...The only good scene in the whole thing really is one from the trailer
and at the very beginning of the movie, I can't say which scene because
I want this to be a 'spoiler-free' review. It's the first pivotal event
in the film. Subtle enough? 2 stars for the props and overall dreary
filming locations alone.

i give it 2 only for the nature shots that were done very nicelymay be this Inaritu dude should have been a wild life photographer clearly, he can't shoot good movies despite the recent Oscar which i
think is a completely political award that has nothing to do with
making good movies.The Revenant is corny as hell. Completely bogus plot. Plainly stupid
plot. Dragged out and predictable.There is already a revenge theme movie set as an example for what a
revenge movie should be and that's Clint Eastwood's The Unforgiven.The Revenant is an example of what a revenge movie should NOT be.DiCaprio was trying though. He was trying. He is a good actor. But the
plot.. man, the plot is plainly stupid. As in completely.Plus the political undertones of this movie fall completely out of
place.You know what.. watch this movie for the nature scenery. It's really
nice.Maybe Mr.Inaritu should change his specialization to a Camera man for
National Geographic or something.And I get it that DiCaprio wants an Oscar really really bad.. coz there
is no clear explanation to why he agreed to place that role he played
into his credits. Clearly this is one of the corniest roles he played. What DiCaprio's character does in the movie will roll all of the eyes
of any 10000 eyed monster. The story is just dumb. Sorry. Don't want to make any spoilers coz i
actually want people to watch this movie for the nature scenes and have
some laughs and eye rolls.It's kinda entertaining from a Movie Theater 3000 perspective.Go watch it. But remember.. It's dumb as hell. Beautiful nature shots
though.PS Hardy's part doesn't suit Hardy. It seems that his character was
over-hyped for Hardy's popularity. Plus his role is also corny as hell.PSS And that dude with weird eye brows.. Wonder why he gets a main role
in all movies he does. Can't see anything special about this dude
besides his eye brows. He is not a good actor. Over plays his roles as
i've noticed from previous movies he has appeared in.PSSS Also.. a word about the native Americans. They are not and were
not savages. Hollywood gotta stop with these "savages" references. And
white people didn't generally consider natives as savages. The church
considered natives as savages. THE CHURCH. Not the people. People back
then were socially quite on the same level, weather it be a white man
living in a city of any native living in his village. Basically only a
tiny fraction of "elite" living in cities considered the so called
peasants as savages. Regular men themselves could have careless-ed
about the aesthetics. Back then all people were not refined to a level
where they could make such pompous judgment about others. So when I see
when Hollywood tries in every movie to portray white men as pompous
judges of aesthetic values it makes me cringe at these attempts to
promote white guilt tendencies further then they already appear to be
at. I mean if you want to explore that white guilt trend then go for
real facts. Don't make things up only so you can appeal to some
political trends.PSSSS The main question i have after watching this movie is why the son
of DiCaprio's character and that hot Native chick came out to be so
ugly. I mean COME ON!!! The chick was hot.. DiCaprio is also good
looking and there is no reason why nature would award that nice couple
with such an ugly kid. No reason. Unless she was cheating.COME ON!!! This is corny. Plus his son is a weak ass emo type. How
come?? The father is a bad-ass and the son is a weak ass whiner.Good nature though. Really Nice. They should cut all the action scenes
from the movie and leave only the nature shots.Go see it. It's so bad.. it's kinda good in the way it's so bad.But also keep in mind to NOT use the survival tips from this movie in
real life. Seriously. You will die. So just keep that in mind, that
this movie is not gonna give you any useful survival info.Seriously, DiCaprio's character didn't even get a cold. Maybe he is
Wolverine from The X-Men. Who knows. May be this movie is a prequel to
X-Men. Kinda looks like it.

The movie is nothing more than a Hollywood ripoff. See "Man in the
Wilderness". (1971). Starring Richard Harris and John Huston. This
includes the bear attack and left for dead. An Absolute RIPOFF. Sorry
this is a joke just like Leo for doing such a sham! The same can be
said of Will Smith's I am Legend. A Hollywood Ripoff of the Omega Man.
(1971). Starring Charlton Heston Anthony Zerbe. Right down to the
zombies and his blood cure.When will Hollywood get through their heads that just changing the
title and actors doesn't make this a different film. This is a ripoff
of a classic film.Leo should be embarrassed!

The upsides to revenant --Lots of gritty action --Decent special
effects --Good acting --Good cinematography --Good costumes--Downside, the entire script is based on knowing an audience's
attention span is 15 minutes, make the story mesh for 15 minutes, and
then you can start over from scratch, as long as you keep them
engrossed in the action--The Pawnee, a Midwest tribe in Nebraska, ending up in the mountain
ranges of British Columbia is ridiculous. --The French traders are making a living trading fur with the Indians,
but they kidnap a Pawnee Indian girl from one of the tribes they trade
with and serial rape her, and kill a stray Pawnee Indian they come
across (the french can verbally communicate with the Pawnee) and hang a
sign on his body written in french (the Pawnee speak french), the whole
thing was done to create an additional antagonist, Hollywood style. The
reality is, people (even evil French), would never jeopardize their
business and lives in this fashion. --Our protagonist gets cold and manages to generate a fire with a flint
and black powder, all well and good. THEN our protagonist is caught up
in a river that is below freezing, he goes over waterfalls, through
raging rapids, finds a tree piece to cling to and after several more
minutes lands safely on land. The life expectancy for someone with a
ravaged sickly body in such water is under 15 minutes. Our hero climbs
onto shore, the camera pans somewhere else, and comes back to out hero
with a blazing fire. EVEN if the guy still had some black powder (which
he doesn't, he left it behind), it would never be able to start a fire
with wet powder.--Our hero comes upon the French and sorta saves the Pawnee Indian girl
(in British Columbia), and takes a good ole black powder pistol, maybe
its a flintlock, maybe. In any event, he takes the pistol, and some how
manages to get off 3-4 shots with that one shot pistol, taking down Bad
guys while riding a horse. Then later he gets set upon by a pack of
Indians, and gets off a few more shots, taking out Indians while riding
horse back, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the SEMI AUTOMATIC black
powder pistol(Glass was bear mauled in the 1820s, so it was a semi
automatic cap and ball pistol folks).--Now we come to the climax. The bad guy runs off with the company
money and two guys go after him. This is WITH the knowledge that the
guy has taken everyone's pay, is heavily armed and the country side is
crawling with misplaced enraged Pawnee tribes. TWO guys go out to get
the baddee. Not likely, in reality the fort would have sent as many
people as it could spare.I'm not going to bother to elaborate about the real facts of the Glass
bear attack; that there was no revenge factor after Glass was mauled by
a bear. He had no children. That he was in fact mauled during summer.
That the colleagues of Glass killed the she bear and nursed Glass back
to health, somewhere in the sunny midwest (not BC in the winter). Finally, the movie does not say at the end that no animals were brought
to harm, I know they used puppets and special effects in some cases for
the animals, but if in fact animals were not brought to harm in the
making of this movie, it WOULD say so in the credits. -IE, animals were killed in the making of this movie

Relentlessly boring yarn about the implausible recovery of a chap
attacked by a wolf.Nice photograph but even this feature quickly wears out it's welcome
after the first few days! (Well, that's what it feels like.)The cookie cutter bad guys, innocent guys, honorable guys all pop in
and out of the scenery...but it's not enough to save this long, long
sleep-fest.Add to that the fact that the entire premise is so preposterous, then
it just makes the whole movie experience a drain on your patience.On the upside, if you like snow, then maybe you can get through it.

Let me start by saying that I love this movie. I don't recall another
movie speaking to me this much emotionally in recent years. Under the
Skin comes to my mind, but this I think is a more accessible film which
touched me more. Another one that comes to my mind is Children of Men,
which is a great film as well, in my opinion.It's a story about humanity, really. About what's really important when
the chips are down and we are reduced to our bare essentials. About
closeness of individuals, about honor, about justice, about revenge,
about survival. The film is beautifully shot and sports a beautiful
score. The acting is very good, with an outstanding performance by Tom
Hardy. Leo is pretty good as well ;)If you like a movie that resonates with your deepest, rawest emotions,
see this movie.

After watching this film on the big screen, my second time overall, I
was still in awe of this beautiful looking film. It's SO GORGEOUS, sure
the film has it's other strong suits but the direction (Inarittu) and
cinematography (Lubezki), two categories it won Oscars in, is so
overwhelming I couldn't understand why a certain section of the
audience did not find this a good watch. It is a very old school film
it has this strong 70's vibe where the story is not told and is left
for you to figure out. I watched this with a friend who did not enjoy
this as much and suggested that the movie would have been better if
DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass narrated in the film and spelled out
his ordeals to the audience. I called my friend a pleb because I am a
high and mighty jerk like that but on a serious note while a narration
would have helped with the casual audience, it would also promote spoon
feeding hand holding which has become the norm of today's films. The
performances were great and a movie like this falls apart if the
performances are not good they are the only thing connecting the
audience to the film. Well deserved Oscar for DiCaprio, arguably career
best performance from him, Tom Hardy was great too shame no Oscar
though, some scenes were so intense I could feel it taking a mental
toll on me of which the bear mauling scene was on the forefront.
Overall a very visceral movie which used only natural light while
filming and will stand the test of time, something which this year's
winner Spotlight cannot claim.

The complete package for the movie lover. the movie is not for

performances and incredible story...... More over it contains thrill
horror and suspense.. All Over good work done by every member of the
Team. Its also better to watch at big screen. Doesn't have much story
but written good and efficient. Totally Oscar deserved acting by
Leonardo DiCaprio. The Location is also very intimidating The best
scene was when DiCaprio gets up from the grave. More over the movie was
Capriolistic ... Totally satisfied with the movie and a really deserved
Oscar #ThankyouDiCaprio.

This motion picture excels in all facets of film-making, period. First
and foremost: script/plot/story = completely compelling. Second:
acting/characters -- especially important in a film that has minimal
dialogue! Third: Cinematography, which as in all truly great films is
rendered so perfectly as to become an integral element that, without
which, the movie would slip significantly in impacted meaning and
significance. Fourth: Costumes and make-up, bringing savage wilderness
to life for 21st Century denizens as we current movie goers most
certainly are. Fifth: best and not overly utilized CG available to
movies today. So, to bring all up-to-date, forget Scorsese and
DiCaprio, as Leonardo has now fully matured and broken his chains to
get and take the best dramatic role of his already-illustrious career.
Sad note: Leonardo did not humbly accept the Oscar as recognition for
his artistic contribution to film, but instead selfishly and
egotistically used the long-overdue Oscar a a platform for his
empty-headed political view of today's world. Kinda glad he hasn't
reproduced by now, but this movie is intensely extraordinary.

It's only been a year since Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu delivered the
award winning Birdman and somehow he managed to deliver another visual
masterpiece in record time. To follow up such a groundbreaking film
like Birdman, with an epic adventure film like The Revenant is
mesmerizing. But Gonzalez doesn't deserve all the credit, his films
have stood out because of Emmanuel Lubezki's groundbreaking
cinematography. The best thing about The Revenant is without a doubt
its visual style. And the same could be said about Lubezki's previous
efforts: Gravity and Birdman. In three years Lubezki has delivered some
of the most beautiful looking films of our decade (and I'm not even
including The Tree of Life which he worked on in 2011). This man is
pure genius and will without a doubt win his third Oscar in a row. I
hope the two continue to work together and deliver more visually
inspiring films. Leonardo DiCaprio deserves all the accolades he's received for his
physically demanding performance here. From the very first scene we see
him face one obstacle after another as the opening sequence takes place
while he is being attacked by a group of Indians during a fur trading
expedition. It's not much later when the much commented bear mauling
scene takes place, but that is only the beginning of his struggles.
DiCaprio gives it his all and even though this isn't the best
performance of his career, it will finally be the one that gives him
the Oscar. Tom Hardy also delivers a fantastic supporting performance
as John Fitzgerald, the man who wants to leave him behind. The film
ends up feeling like one long chase in a similar way as Mad Max Fury
Road, although at a much slower pace. A survival/revenge film like this
has never looked so beautiful. The film is a bit too long and it
eventually begins to wear down, but it's a constant feast to the eyes
despite the exhaustion.

This is going to be a hard review to do. On one hand, you have a film
that has breathtaking cinematography and amazing practical visual
effects. Not to even mention the acting. But on the other hand, you
have a movie that is designed for the festival circuit. It has the long
pauses between scenes, the long exposure shots of nature for you to
come to terms that the film only used natural lights and there was no
addition of exterior light set up. Not to mention the length time of
the story could've been done in half the time. I have been a fan of Leo for a while now. I believe that he should've
won for What's eating Gilbert Grape and Blood Diamond, but it wasn't
meant to be.Acting in the Revenant is of extremely high caliber. Leonardo DiCaprio
does a fantastic job showing his acting range in emotion and through
use of expression rather then dialogue as it is kept to a minimum. All
of the cast did a fantastic job. Tom Hardy was better then what i was
expecting, i have found that in some films he has the tendency to go
back and do certain traits of his own, but in this film he was really
kept to his character.Story; as most people already know that the story is based on a book by
the same title. It follows the struggle of Hugh Glass as he is left for
dead after a bear had mauled him. The film really allows Leo the
freedom to capture our attention and grab us by the throat as we watch
him growl, cough, bleed and struggle to make out one sound. The story
of survival and vengeance of Hugh Glass is extremely interesting and
will have your attention. However, the constant cuts to the 30 seconds
clips of nature and the surrounding forests or mountain rivers are
beautiful but are distracting and in some way make you lose
concentration and you start to wonder how long would this film have
been if it was cut properly. This is a great film, for those who love to capture and analyse every
aspect of a movie. It has incredible visual effects, great acting,
incredible camera work and fantastic score. But for those who are
casual movie goers and just want to watch the story and are not as
intrigued by the practical side of making films, will be left looking
at their watch and thinking when is this film going to end.

Inception has been the best film, the character of Mr. Cobb has many
similarities with my personal life. No film can take that first place
in my list except this film. But, oh boy, Revenant. He just incepted another idea in our minds, that
nothing is impossible for this legend. And the whole cast and crew,
what a job they've done. There was no way for Oscars to ignore this
movie. Maybe there will be more thrilling films in the future, but
these ones will remain in our heart. Good stories never get forgotten,
only the name of the film gives me enough chills. It's a must watch.When I become a grandpa, my grand kids will be baffled to see these
films in my play-list.

(Spoilers) This was a great adventure, a story of survival. With a
tremendous mood setting soundtrack and beautiful, very intelligent
scenery. I was immersed for the first time in years. I found myself
getting anxious and tense along with the characters, that does not
happen often anymore. This truly is a gem. Story aside, it brought me
way back to the first time I saw Dances With Wolves. A very long movie
but, you just get pulled in. I only gave it a 9/10 because some
supporting cast members annoyed me. Hugh's boy almost felt like they
were too close in age, the boy just seemed older than he should have
been. I like Will Poulter, however, I cant look at him without hearing
him sing "Waterfalls", from We Are the Millers.Leonardo may have won best actor, but without Tom Hardy, the movie
doesn't have nearly the same effect. He was perfect, "Tom Hardy
disappeared into his character so well that for half the movie I
thought he was Christian Bale. You really see and believe his inner
struggle between doing what was right and what was easy or selfish. It
was hard to hate him completely. A very interesting character.Domhnall Gleeson was another pleasant surprise. Not at all the
Cardboard General he was in Star Wars.Definitely a great movie to snuggle up for a long cozy night on the
couch with a special someone.

Wow. Just wow. No movie has ever engaged me so much yet have very
little dialogue being said. First off, the good things (and there's a
lot). The cinematography is amazing. I've never seen a movie looking as
beautiful as this does. There were some action scenes where it was all
one really long shot just like in Alejandro González Iñárritu's last
film, Birdman. Also, all the performances in this movie were top notch.
Leonardo Dicaprio is at his best in this movie, even though he has
barely any lines, and Tom Hardy gives the best performance I've seen
from him so far. Even the supporting characters, which include Will
Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson, were really good. Another thing is that
this movie is the grittiest movie I've ever watched. There are parts
where it can get very violent and disturbing. Fortunately, it helped
add some very intense and memorable scenes (*cough cough* the bear
scene *cough cough*). Now the only thing wrong with the movie is not
necessarily what came out of my experience of the movie, but rather
what it might be like for all audiences. This is not a movie for
everyone. There are people who might find this movie boring because of
its slow pace at some points and the very little dialogue that there
is. This is not a bad thing though. Everyone has their preferences so
some people might find the movie boring. Also, there is one really
small scene concerning Hugh Glass's wife that was a little too strange
and didn't make sense. But that's just me. In the end, this is a near
perfect film. It is the most beautiful yet the grittiest film I've ever
seen. I give this a 10 out of 10.

After watching The Revenant one is bound to impressed by certain
aspects of the movie. One, with Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. One
just can't help but be in awe of his art. Second, with the acting performances of ‪Leonardo DiCaprio‬ and Tom
Hardy and in that order. DiCaprio's Oscar is thoroughly deserved. No
argument(s) can justify otherwise, especially in comparison to the
competition on offer. Given he gets to speak very little English, the
part can qualify as non-English which puts DiCaprio in a very special
league of Oscar winners. His performance reminds one of Tom Hank's
gruelling portrayal in Cast Away. As for Hardy, he is undoubtedly
robbed off an Oscar. It's his portrayal of a mangy mongrel that makes
the movie deviously entertaining. Third, of course by Inarritu's cinematic vision. The Revenant may far
from being a great film (actually, that's for the time to decide) but
it is nothing short of a bold statement which will inspire other
leading filmmakers to push their boundaries. The film is more about
survival than it's about revenge and that's where most people have got
it wrong. Laymen may call it man versus wild but those with keener
observation will perceive it as a treatise on man's symbiotic
relationship with mother nature. The only way to watch it is on the big
screen else you would be doing a great injustice to yourself.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blog "A Potpourri
of Vestiges".

Watched a 4k digital version on a large screen (IMAX, but the version
presented was anything but that). Now, if anyone has seen Mel Gibson's 'Apocalypto', that movie can give
you a fair idea on what to expect, both in terms of this being a
frenetically paced set-piece rolling after set- piece, with the makers
not holding back on period gore throughout. Tough to sit through, but
its an experience of sorts. What I was nevertheless surprised by, is how little of the main plot
has been given away by this movie's trailers and many reviews. Kudos
both to the marketing team of the movie, and fans who did check
themselves while trying to describe their own experience while viewing
this. Other than 'Apocalypto', this one also shares DNA with 'Mad Max: Fury
road' and 'Birdman: the unexpected value of ignorance' (Inarritu's own
creation from last year). While the former comparison has more to do
with the forceful and relentless nature of things, the latter
comparison is due to the fact that we are forced to inhabit the same
world that the main lead does, and follow him around throughout, from
beginning to end. Tom Hardy plays the heavy, interestingly reunited with his co-star from
'Inception', Leonardo DiCaprio, who has to be one of the most punished
lead characters ever put on film. Will this work the Oscar magic for
him though? Considering this is a very controversial year for the
Oscars, even a win this year might just be considered pyrrhic due to
the color of his skin (the controversy sheds light on a fair point, but
this nomination might just not be a part of it).All that shouldn't detract from the fact that this was well put
together, from cinematography to score, direction to editing, and yes,
makes this a superior movie to Apocalypto even.I'm heading to the (censored) (L)I(e)max viewing this week, and do feel
this is one for multiple viewings.More thoughts from 2 viewing, on a (L)I(e)max screen, with ambient
construction noise screwing up the sound design playing back, and one
side of the digitally projected image flickering continually.Observed that Domhnall Gleeson (Ex machina, About time, Force awakens,
Shadow dancer, son of Brendan 'Troy' 'Calvary' 'Garda' Gleeson)
acquired himself admirably, having the 3rd best presence, allegiance
DiCaprio and Hardy (unfairly overlooked for a spring actor nomination,
that, imo, he was a 'Locke' for)...The other comparisons we could make, include 'The last of the Mohicans'
and 'The Road' (even 'The Walking Dead'), and though I felt this was
better than 'Apocalypto', overall, I still found this wanting in the
action set-piece department.I do know that I have to read the book this one's based on, especially
to understand about the Sioux and the Pawnee tribes that are very much
a party of this tale.

After being mauled by a bear during a hunting expedition in the 1820's,
fur trader Andrew Henry (Leonardo Dicaprio) is left for dead and buried
alive after his half breed son is killed by John Fitzgerald (Tom
Hardy), resulting in a fierce and brutal struggle for survival as he
attempts to make his way back to civilization for revenge against
Fitzgerald.Opening with a visually masterful fight scene between the hunting crew
and the Arikara tribes, Alejandro Inarritu brilliantly captures
(through extended takes and natural lighting) the complete feeling of
being in the freezing wilderness. From walking in the rain to running
in the snow, you feel every single nit bit of detail within the scene.
Like Birdman, he likes to capture everything in one, making for a very
strong directing job.Overall, it is rich with environment, which is its main factor. Leo
spends most of his time in the wilderness on his own, trying to
survive. His desperation increases more and more as you see him
progressively determined. From sleeping inside a horse to eating rotten
boar flesh, Leo goes all out in here and is completely immersed in
every scene he's in. I wish Tom Hardy got more screen time, there was
some good potential for a very unique character study. Even though it
was still good, I feel like they might have missed out.Even though style over substance is usually not good, this is one of
the most masterfully filmed movies I have ever seen. It makes me wonder
how they got some of these shots. Compliments to them for the use of
natural lighting, which is a good touch, and really pays off. I wish
Alejandro did what he did in Birdman, and have more dream sequences,
and more spiritual scenery to add to the gritty feeling. Once you
factor out the detailed environment and long structure of it all, what
you get is a pretty basic revenge story. With that said, it is so
technically marvelous it overshadows it completely.Regardless of its few complaints, it is one of the most riveting
experiences I've ever had with a film. Watch in on Blu-Ray, on an HDTV,
turn out the lights and turn on the surround sound, and get ready to
travel to a new world, because this is the movie to do it.

Leonardo Dicaprio keep appearing in powerful movies with his impacting
acting but keep denied to take home the academy award. This time I
guess he will make it.About the movie, it's a movie based on real life explorer Hugh Glass,
about how he survived in his expedition while attacked and wounded by a
grizzly and abandoned by his mates.In the my opinion the movie is stretched about half an hour too much
but still it wasn't a boring survival movie we witness normally.
Director Alejandro González Iñárritu kept it pacey and eventful. The
only cheers come from the audience is actually the last 15 minutes of
the movie.Dicaprio as usual at his best, he is just perfect for the movies set up
in 18th and early 19th century. Tom Hardy makes delicious villain here,to be honest I was never fan of
Hardy even when he appeared in 'Dark Knight Rises', but in this one he
really sparked. A true old fashioned villain who justifies his wrong
doing, from stealing to killing.And you can see Will Poulter in a completely different avatar if you
still remember him from 'We're The Millers'It was a real treat to watch if you like the movies from the American
civil war era. If you are up for that, I would say you don't miss it.

The Revenant :Few Movies will leave an impact on you that will stay
with you forever ,American History X was one of that kind, and Revenant
is no different , The first half was so intense that i was totally
immersed in the movie , DiCaprio just explodes in every scene in the
movie he has practically brought glass to life , the acting is so
intense that you will feel every emotion that Glass goes through over
the course of the movie , DiCaprio has taken the acting to a whole new
different level with the Revenant that you cannot even imagine,i have
seen him over the years in pretty intense roles but revenant is
something else all together,there were few sequences in the movie in
which i hardly moved a muscle , the movie has been shot beautifully by
Alejandro and he had insisted on not using the green screen for most of
the shots , the background score is also superb ,it is easy to neglect
tom hardy's performance but he also has delivered one of his best
performances till date ,Overall i would say you can miss a meal but
don't miss revenant because revenant is not a movie it is an intense
experience that you should not miss. A lot has been said on Leo winning
the Oscar and all but people always forget not everyone does movies for
awards and Leo's not one of them he has done memorable roles in the
past be it the undercover cop in departed , or be it the wallstreet
stock broker in the wolf of wallstreet which never got him an Oscar,he
surely does deserve it this time because what he has gone through for
this role only a few actors before him have done it ,I am hoping this
time he gets the award , but even if he doesn't he will still be one of
the best actors of our time . "As long as you can still grab a breath,
you fight. You breathe. Keep breathing. When there is a storm and you
stand in front of a tree, if you look at its branches, you swear it
will fall. But if you watch the trunk, you will see its stability"

cool movie! i'm impressed with bear attack scene, Tom Hardy's voice,
amazing performance of both main character. i liked Leo more than Tom
but in last scene when Fitz said:"...did you enjoy it, Glass?..cause
there ain't nothing gonna bring your boy back"... His face is so
amazing made me really feel pity for him even though whatever he did.
And Leo, He is great too, but i think sometime in this movies his
emotion is a bit overdone and the scene when Glass eat uncooked food
with a fire next to him i think it's an excessive sacrifice. Anyway
this movie still one of the best movies in 2015 and Leo and tom, they
deserve to win an Oscar

At over 2 and a half hours, Alejandro González Iñárritu's latest film
is a true epic. A thrilling, survival western full of adventure,
visually stunning camera-work, and some surprisingly strong brutality.It has a very simple story, and handles it to near perfection, showing
the most horrific side of both nature and humanity. While it may not
suit everybody's tastes and may come as a disappointment to people who
may be looking for better all around plot and haven't really done any
research beyond the fact that it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and has been
nominated for quite a few Oscars. If you're looking for the best film
of all time, you may not really find it here, because there are some
flaws.From my point of view, while this was easily one of my favorite films
to come out this year, the running time seemed like it could've been a
bit shortened. I get that it is an epic film, but you could've cut
around 10-20 minutes of the film and it would have a very similar
impact on me. However, while it was a bit on the long side, I was never
actually bored or anything throughout the film, I just needed to look
down at my watch a couple of times.The performances are spectacular. Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar
at this point (he was horribly snubbed in 2013, when he didn't win the
Oscar for his absolute greatest performance in the hilarious satire
"The Wolf of Wall Street"), and Tom Hardy does even better as the
villainous murderer of DiCaprio's son who leaves him alone to die in
the cold. Hardy manages to put in a lot of power and intensity into his
performance, even more so than DiCaprio, and is one of the film's
absolute highlights. He really transforms into this spectacular
character!The camera-work and filmmaking are breathtaking. They showcase the
brutality in a way that made me feel as if I were really there, using
some really long shots and fascinating camera angles, this is a true
artistic masterpiece."The Revenant" is a great film if you know what you're getting into.

The Revenant tells the story of frontiersman, Hugh Glass(Leonardo
DiCaprio). In the 1820s while on a fur trading expedition, Glass gets
severely mauled by a bear. His companions on the trip decide that, even
though he's alive, he's struggling to remain that way. Therefore, due
to the difficulties of lugging Glass around in the bitter cold, they
decide to leave him behind. Now, Hugh Glass begins to battle for his
survival in the extreme climatic conditions, while also plotting his
revenge against all of the people who leave him to die. The Revenant is not only an outstanding film but also, a one of a kind
experience on the big screen. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu strikes
gold yet again, with this revenge drama. What is staggeringly brilliant
is, how different this movie is, compared to Inarritu's previous movie,
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014). Inarritu &
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have yet again adopted revolutionary
shooting techniques for this film. Just like how Birdman was shot in
one continuous take, this film uses only natural lighting throughout
its run-time. The locations are breathtaking. The thing that has to be
appreciated the most is that, not an ounce of all the various locales,
were shot in front of a green screen. The CGI rendered animals are
extremely realistic, with the highlight being the bear, of course. The
music by Alva Noto & Ryuichi Sakamoto is haunting & divine, at the same
time. Though this film is flawless, there is quite a lot of gore, which
some people might find disturbing. The performances are one, among the
various highlights of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio has given one of the
best performances in Hollywood history, as Hugh Glass. DiCaprio
portrays a variety of complex & subtle emotions, just through his eyes.
This is because DiCaprio is on his own, for the most part of the film.
Tom Hardy is spectacular as John Fitzgerald. Domhnall Gleeson is great
as Captain Andrew Henry. Will Poulter is superb as Bridger. Forrest
Goodluck is amazing in his Hollywood debut, as Hawk. The supporting
cast is awesome too. The Revenant is a must watch. It deserves all the
accolades & praise it has received & is yet to receive. Go, grab that
Oscar, Leo!

I am extremely happy I saw the 2hr36minute movie The Revenant.
excellent Direction once again by Alejandro González Inarritu (loved
Birdman , Babel )and superb acting by Leonardo DiCaprio (awesome in
every movie :wolf of WS, Departed, Shutter island, Revolutionary Road
to name a few) as Hugh Glass. Hugh Glass fights for surviving the
bitter cold after he is left behind by his team in 1820s.He survives
the bitter cold and seeks shelter and warmth inside body of a dead
horse after he removes all organs. I love the scenes where Hugh crawls
into dead horse empty on the inside. I enjoyed when Hugh makes friends
with the native American and enjoys sticking out his tongue and making
happy sounds. The scenes when Hugh sees his young son dragged and
killed are done very well. When one loves life and has a strong desire
to live, one can withstand whatever comes in the way and Hugh Glass
proves this in the movie. Terrific. Superb movie. Excellent acting by
Leonardo DiCaprio. Superb Cinematography. Superb Direction. Oscar
worthy in many categories.

This movie much like Innaritu's last takes cinematography to a whole
new level in a gorgeously shot movie. front start to finish you are
presented with breathtaking shots of the landscape and how DiCaprio's
character deals with it. There were points where i felt like i was
right next to the action and it was an incredibly immersive experience.
one shot in particular astounded me: this shot was in the woods near
the end of the movie where DiCaprios character is found; the screen is
completely black and then the glow of torches starts to fade through
the trees. i was shocked as i looked through a glowing forest at the
men riding their horses toward me. This is the type of cinematographal
prowess Innaritu is able to bring to the screen, really fantastic and i
will be quite surprised if it doesn't take the Oscar for that category. The acting was extremely well done, with Leonardo putting in a seller
performance filled with anguish, and Tom Hardy making me absolutely
despise his character by the end. The acting was complemented with a
good story and a better script (or lack of rather), but i did find
myself getting bored at times because sometimes things took just a
little bit too long. what i mean to say is that it could have been a
shorter movie. the first half of the movie was great and i got really
interested in the story especially after his son died, but i began to
forget about those conflicts as the movies went on. i do appreciate the
survival parts but i felt that they were drawn out almost to the point
that i lost interest in the conflicts between characters and got
distracted by his conflict with nature. not that this is bad, on the
contrary that can be very compelling as it kind of pulls your attention
in the direction of the character, but for me it just took away from
the previous plot lines and didn't advance its own enough. Overall a fantastic film both technically and creatively, that shows
off the brilliance of Innaritu

In 1823, in the unsettled Northern Plains of America, trapper Hugh
Glass, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, is savagely attacked by a bear, in
a scene that became an instant classic and as far Glass'
(mis)adventures will go, only the starters. Later, he witnesses the
killing of his half-Native son by the Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) and is
left for dead, with a body so severely mauled he can hardly breath,
speak, or walk. Glass crawls his way out to the next river and then
begins the harrowing journey of a man within an inch of life, but an
eternity on the scale of his revenge.As hackneyed as it sounds, "The Revenant" is one of these films the
expression 'cinematic experience' was invented for. It is a
survival-into-wilderness tale that elevates the word 'pain' to
unexplored territories, not even "Cast Away", and certainly not "The
Martian" and I complained about co-nominee Damon not having enough
scenes to show the struggle of a man trapped in a hopeless situation
(at least Glass had a 'roadmap') but at the end, no performances came
close to Leo in "The Revenant", and his Oscar win is as a mathematical
certainty as the Titanic sinking. François Truffaut said "a movie
should either show the joy or the agony of making the film". "The
Revenant" gloriously embodies this agony and the result is as
miraculous as Glass' recovery. And if Leo gets the lion share of
recognition, director Inarritu and cinematographer Lubeski deserve all
the credit for overcoming the technical difficulties that undermined
the shooting, from the weather to the lighting.Of course, it's not difficult to make a dazzling movie with a beautiful
setting like this but there's something in Inarritu's directing that
literally made 'nature' alive. And watching "The Revenant" was like
penetrating the hostile wilderness, we feel like the pelt-trappers
waiting for an arrow to erase one of us from life. Those were the
unsettled days where men with greed by way of bravery, paved the way to
the conquest of a yet unknown America. This 'unknown' feeling is
conveyed in the opening sequence that reminds of the landing massacre
in "Saving Private Ryan", where you know the quietness of nature is
only the omen of an imminent violence. And from the graphicness, you
know it's not a 'savage' vs. 'civilized world' thing, it's just men
protecting their possessions, expressing their natural instinct, like
Glass protecting his son from the suspicious eyes of the other trappers
or the mother bear attacking Glass to protect her cubs. What I own, I
protect."The Revenant" has its share of quiet and quite surreal moments though,
where Glass is haunted by the visions of his deceased wife, a bit like
in "Gladiator". There are also fraternal exchanges between men, to
highlight the edge of human culture over nature, men talk of their
wives, of home, Natives are not just victims and some reluctantly deal
with French trappers, as if they knew time plays against them. And
there are a few inspirational moments of interracial exchanges, proving
that there could be a communion of cultures, even in these days. While
not unnecessary, I saw these scenes as relatively needless interludes,
I'm not sure the film needed the revenge either, which was a first
departure from the real story. Apparently, there was a need of a human
antagonist, and it was Tom Hardy as the unscrupulous and manipulative
Fitzgerald. So, for all its hypnotically groundbreaking creation, the
film sticks with the classic good vs. evil, which is, after all, a part
of human nature.And Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a rather introspective film. He's
menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his eyes speak more than
his actions, so despite the verbal richness of his role, he still says
more with his eyes, and looks like a ferocious beast who'd never
hesitate to attack when smelling the danger. And the final
confrontation is like the recreation of the bear scene, proving that
once you hit a man's deepest instincts, the beasts inside awakens. What
I own, I protect, and for what I protect, I kill. And it's only when he
remembers the words from a Native helper that Glass stops acting like
an animal. And this is when you get the meaning of the title. "The
Revenant" carries this come-back notion, but it also has to do with the
French translation as 'revenant' is a 'soul' or a 'spirit'. Hugh Glass
is much alive, as he carries the soul of a deceased family, and it's
his connection to the world of the dead that keeps guiding him in his
road for survival and his quest for justice.And in the end, that's what differentiates human beings to nature and
animals, like them, we have a past, we have a life, and a future which
is death, but only we, humans, are aware of them. It's all about
fighting nature with humanity and then fighting the beast inside us
with the same weapon, "The Revenant" is not just a revenge story, it's
a journey into the meaning of our own humanity.Now, what lies behind this last shot? Maybe the sadness of a man whose soul can rest now, but whose heart is
still tormented. An end that is waiting for a new beginning? A sort of
'what now?' I'm still puzzled by that last shot, but I think there's an
interesting correlation with Leo's role (so much has been said about
it) He swam in cold waters, ate a raw buffalo liver, and went through
the most painful extreme, he'll get his overdue Oscar, and he'll never
have a more difficult role. So what can he do after? Well, I just want to conclude in a lighter tone and say 'give him the
Oscar and give him a break, and a few fun roles in movies that express
this time- the joy of making a film.'

"As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe... keep
breathing."It's only been a year since Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu delivered the
award winning Birdman and somehow he managed to deliver another visual
masterpiece in record time. To follow up such a groundbreaking film
like Birdman, with an epic adventure film like The Revenant is
mesmerizing. But Gonzalez doesn't deserve all the credit, his films
have stood out because of Emmanuel Lubezki's groundbreaking
cinematography. The best thing about The Revenant is without a doubt
its visual style. And the same could be said about Lubezki's previous
efforts: Gravity and Birdman. In three years Lubezki has delivered some
of the most beautiful looking films of our decade (and I'm not even
including The Tree of Life which he worked on in 2011). This man is
pure genius and will without a doubt win his third Oscar in a row. I
hope the two continue to work together and deliver more visually
inspiring films. Leonardo DiCaprio deserves all the accolades he's received for his
physically demanding performance here. From the very first scene we see
him face one obstacle after another as the opening sequence takes place
while he is being attacked by a group of indians during a fur trading
expedition. It's not much later when the much commented bear mauling
scene takes place, but that is only the beginning of his struggles.
DiCaprio gives it his all and even though this isn't the best
performance of his career, it will finally be the one that gives him
the Oscar. Tom Hardy also delivers a fantastic supporting performance
as John Fitzgerald, the man who wants to leave him behind. The film
ends up feeling like one long chase in a similar way as Mad Max Fury
Road, although at a much slower pace. A survival/revenge film like this
has never looked so beautiful. The film is a bit too long and it
eventually begins to wear down, but it's a constant feast to the eyes
despite the exhaustion.

Reading several of the negative reviews of this great film made my
blood boil. How dare you say this there is no character development? This is not a
mini-series! There are time constraints and developing character
generally takes more than three hours. God, you people can be awful,
spoiled ingrates. This film brought me to tears during several scenes.Getting that off my chest, I will now provide my opinion of this
incredible production; which was completed in less than one year. The Revenant is long at over 2 1/2 hours. And yes, it is a bit too
long. Actually it is not, for those not marred by the instant
gratification evidenced in modern society (you poor souls!). The
cinematography and plot are so exceptional you won't notice the
unusually long length.The initial scene involving the battle with the Indians is stunning in
its chaos and unpredictability. The viewer doesn't know who will live
and die and by what means. The battle lines are obscured to a degree
not seen in may films I've viewed.The rest of the film is a long slog through nature in its extreme
challenges and is moving. You may question the motivations and
decisions of the subjects, but these are all conjecture by the director
based on his interpretation of the true story.I will watch this film again with the closed capture enabled because I
only understood about 80% of what was said. It will be worthwhile in my
opinion because, in its essence, this film depicts the good and evil,
along with the greed and selflessness, in every man.

As usual with movies I went into the movie with little or no knowledge
about what the movie was about. The only thing I knew before seeing the
Revenant was that it was hotly tipped for Oscar success. I'm sure most
of the star actors must be teased about considering whether roles may
earn them Oscar glory. Can't imagine that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't
start drafting up the Oscar speech as he read the script for the
Revenant.To be fair there's no doubt that DiCaprio is very good in this movie
and the fact that he's never won an Oscar before must make him a shoe
in for best actor this year. He plays Hugh Glass struggling for
survival in the early part of the 19th century. There's no doubt that
it's an epic journey, but not one that I could ever really engage in.
Couldn't help throughout thinking throughout the film that DiCaprio's
next line was going to be be "please give me an Oscar, so I don't have
to go through this again". For me it's a worthy film, but not one I'll
be watching again anytime soon. Guess that sums up most films that the
academy likes.

I didn't find what I'd expected before. But Leonardo DiCaprio was
excellent at his role. Good starring. Except for few adrenaline-
injected scenes, it's not fulfilling. Maybe, that's because of my
high-expectation. Shortly, I didn't find it charming. In terms of
Leonardo DiCaprio's role-playing, it was completely satisfying as
always. He's now master and admitted actor and a wanted talent. I think
the chance of his being awarded an Oscar on his "The Revenant"
performance will be an injustice against his "Shutter Island" or
"Titanic" performances. Especially in Shutter Island, he successfully
led the psychological and emotional gestures. Plus, the movie was an
masterpiece. However, The Revenant wasn't like that and its not being
an "as expected" excellent work might shadow Leo's likely-awarded
success in my opinion.

The highly appraised and one of the Oscars' favorite left me as cold as
the landscape you see throughout. The big question that everyone will
be asking themselves is: will Leonardo Di Caprio finally win an Oscar?
On the evidence of this performance he shouldn't. For the second year
in succession, Eddie Redmayne has to be the favorite to win the statue. As for the movie, I think it will fall short of an Oscar too, but it's
hard to see which one deserves it more than the Revenant. The bridge of
spies would be the other favorite in my eyes, but it does not feel like
an Oscar worthy movie. It's hard to tell really, and maybe irrelevant
anyway. The point is that The Revenant is a magnificent movie from the point of
view of the photography, and I can only imagine the nightmare it must
have been to record such a movie in absolute freezing conditions. But
in the end, what matters is the emotions you feel when you watch it,
and in that department it left completely uninspired. I understand that
some people will like it a lot, but to me, it lacks punch and
substance. Leonardo Di Caprio was probably crippled a little too long
to make it really entertaining.

The Revenant is an example of real cinema. It is not a pretentious,
pseudo intellectual and pseudo artistic work, it is not a brainless
blockbuster, it is not an example of "style over substance" film as it
is not a story or dialog oriented bore-fest. Some people say that it
was overlong. Why does everyone need short films nowadays? Because,
they want to consume a movie as soon as possible, then go back their
home or text messages by their precious cell phones? Another complaint
for the movie is lack of story and depth. I have to disagree. The story
in the film is not sophisticated maybe and maybe it is a conventional
one for such an unconventional film (not a typical example of
mainstream cinema though) However, this doesn't mean that the movie is
shallow or it has nothing to say to the audience. There is no real
character depth in the film, but do we really need "Shakespearean"
characters for this film? This is not "Who is afraid of Virginia
Woolf?" As for realism of the movie, of course there are some parts
that require suspension of disbelief, but it does not ruin your
experience. As for the bear scene, I didn't see anything like this
before. Period. The movie could have been boring if Inarritu would have
tried to tell us the love story between our survivor and his wife,
because then the movie would be another Pocahontas tale or a very
similar film with Terrence Malick's "The New World." Also The Revenant
is not this year's Dances with Wolves or something. If we don't
consider "Man in Wilderness", this is a totally unique and distinctive
film. Honestly, I hated "Birdman", because it was pretentious and no
heart and soul in the delivery. The Revenant is natural and emotional,
yet not overly sentimental or heartwarming. I don't enjoy "cold" movies
personally, but The Revenant is not such a movie. You feel the film.
You feel the scenery. You feel the situation of the characters.
However, the most important, you feel the film. Birdman? It is hard to
say. Leonardo Di Caprio delivers very well, even if still his greatest
performance is in "What's eating Gilbert Grape?" Nobody, but nobody can
be better than Leo in that film in cinema history! Leo deserves the
Oscar this time maybe (also he should have won in "The Departed") but
honestly, if there is someone better than him in the movie, he is Tom
Hardy! He does it again. One more time, he proves that he is one of the
best actors in this generation and he steals every scene he is in. A
trenchant, brutal and stunning performance! Leo's great performance is
based on physical difficulties and emotion. Inarritu's direction is
perfect here. No need to say that the scenery is beautiful, the
cinematography is mesmerizing, the shots are terrific, the editing is
brilliant, visual effects are superb etc. Don't expect some clichés
like Di Caprio's character befriends Indians, then fight back etc. No.
This is a different film. That's why it is not boring. The Revenant has
a gripping story. It has a story. It has substance. Yes, maybe, in the
second half, the movie loses its intensity and agonizing tone and maybe
the final act is not that unusual or unforgettable or surprising, but
still it delivers. The Revenant is not a thought provoking film, the
revenge story is not bitter, intense or powerful like "Unforgiven, but
it has enough words to say about life and death, revenge, human nature
and God. And I am very glad that the characters don't speak too much so
we enjoy the great scenery.

The Revenant, was a film that with it's style and the way it was done
certainly reminded me of films and directors of past and present, but
overall it was a film experience that I will probably remember for
quite some time. The film is supposedly based on a true story which is
not necessarily a bad thing at all, but when you watch this film and
see all that the characters go through, I think you will also be
absolutely amazed that people could have actually gone through and
lived like this and even survived some of these circumstances and
situations. The film is so life like with it's makeup and set locations
to it's wonderfully real and yet beautiful and almost mystical
cinematography that we believe everything that is going on before us
and the film affects us that more deeply because of how realistic and
life like everything is. The film with it's filmmaking style as others
have said, reminded me a fair bit of the grand epics of Stanley Kubrick
like 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even The Shining at times and then you
have some dreamlike sequences and shots that really compliment nature
and the outdoors and really make it an important part of this film and
some of those shots and dreamlike scenes reminded me of the work of
Terrence Malick, and how nature and just beauty even when found in
tragic situations and circumstances is always there and how nature and
the outdoors is really a huge part of us and some of those particular
sequences are beautiful to watch and Malick always used the world's
best cinematographers and here Emmanuel Lubezki does the wonderful and
is sure to win an Oscar for the film and what is further interesting is
that Lubezki has also worked with Malick, on such films as the upcoming
Knight of Cups, To the Wonder and Tree of Life. The film also at times
reminded me in style of Paul Thomas Anderson's grand epic, There Will
Be Blood and again that was not surprising because the production
design was by the great Jack Fisk, who worked on There Will Be Blood as
well as working with Malick on Knight of Cups, To the Wonder, The Thin
Red Line, Days of Heaven and Badlands (some of those films he was the
production designer and others the art director), so I think you can
see where and why I base these connections. The Revenant, is certainly
an experience and an assault on your senses and I mean that in the best
way possible. Everything from the visuals which include wonderful
cinematography to the haunting and yet thrilling musical score to just
being one in the barren wilderness all brings together a feast and
visual stimulation for your eyes, ears and every part of your body. It
certainly is a film to see and behold. The story to the film is a
fascinating one and that does really make you want to see where and
what it will do next. The film is longer in length and for the most
part does a really good job of handling a longer running time. I also
liked the whole aspect of man versus man, man versus nature and even
man versus animals that was incorporated into this story and yet again
transports us to the wilderness and how these men were living and shows
that you don't need a modern setting, or technology to make a film
truly interesting, thrilling, or action packed because in this period
piece film everything it needs for such a thrilling film is all right
on display at it's disposal and with the exception of one scene in
particular, the special effects are kept at a low level and natural
effects such as make up and real environments are used instead and I
found that it looks and gives us a more genuine feel and overall
experience with the film that makes it feel more real. Leonardo
DiCaprio who plays the lead character here does go through the
unthinkable and just how he has the determination and strength to keep
pressing on and ultimately trying to right a grievous wrong is
fascinating to watch. DiCaprio put his body through what must have been
a really intense and gruelling film shoot that looks like it was
probably the most difficult film he has ever acted in. The results are
great however as he gives us one of last year's best performances and
will be sure to win an Oscar for his performance. This is a film not
only about survival, but also about what really drives us in life and
what we set forth as our missions and goals in life and how we set out
to seek them no matter how tough it may seem. How the film also
incorporates the native people into this story and giving them
interesting roles that were not just stereotypes was another
interesting aspect I also liked about the film. This is certainly a
film with it's beautiful and mystical look will amaze you yet with it's
brutality and honest and realistic depiction of these circumstances and
settings makes The Revenant a film you will not soon forget which is
the best compliment I can give the film and I truly do mean it.

Everything is excellent in this film, but there is no comfort in it.
You are going to walk out the theater or finish it at home in your
space one day and find yourself shivering to your core.The acting is stellar, the cinema-photography exceptional, the lighting
perfect to the nth degree, the story is great but it is absent any soft
footnote. The moral of this story fits modern times as well; life is
hell and people are out to leave you to die, tear and pick you apart at
any opportunity, and if you are lucky, or persevere, you will survive,
but never unscathed, and never unchanged.It's as real as it gets no matter how many liberties they took with the
real story. This isn't your typical Hollywood story with Hollywood
ending. Worth seeing if only once

From the time the movie opens up it feels as if you have opened your
eyelids and you are at the forefront of the elk hunt. This space that
you are at very rarely strays during the duration. You are not a
spectator, you are a fellow journeyman.This movie is not just a film. It's a cinematic expression of the
entire crew both on and off the screen. And the architect of that
expression is Inarritu. I can only imagine how hard it must have been
to convince the studios to see the vision just through the concept.
After all it's just the constant battle of one man against the nature
and the nature of man. The movie rests on his portrayal of his grit and
tenacity. And would audiences who are used to all high tech visual
effects and racing story lines be patient enough to sit through only
one man's ordeal?Well the answer lies at the heart and soul that the protagonist has
poured, seeped, toiled into the character. With the camera focused on
his each grimace, each torsion of his body Leonardo Di Caprio reigns
tall from the moment the finger lays on the trigger of the gun. He is
the bullet that you see even before the gun has been fired.Tom Hardy one of my fav actors is the perfect foil to the intent of Di
Caprio s character. Here i have to digress a bit. Both these actors
were there in inception - one of my all time favorite. There we see the
masterful Nolan cerebralise these characters and there too we see them
doing the tango gracefully. In the revenant that dance form is waltz
and both of them dance around their inevitable duet with poise and
patience.Am not a fan of the cold climate but when in spite of that i feel the
desire to visit that place says a little something about the
cinematography. Lubezki is the maestro painting his deft strokes. And
back to the architect of this entire vision. Seriously one has to blind
not to see the nuance of the vision that Inarittu lays in front of us.
We are entrenched in the snow alone with him. Thanks for bringing such
an expression where we see how mankind is indebted to mother nature. In
spite of all the ravages we as a human race has inflicted on her nature
still hides us and we hide inside her entrails

For me, this is a story about our dehumanization. The entire setting,
with trapping company that puts its people to great dangers, they work
for relatively modest amounts, people need to be paid to go to search
for a lost man.... This is a strong statement against our greed,
against our pseudo-civilizations where individuals are just
insignificant pieces of world economy, without any attachment to life,
nature, each other. ThE nature for protagonists is just a thing to
exploit for human needs. Though, not for the Director, who is the only
one presenting its above-any-moral beauty.The main character is left empty and it is totally irrelevant will he
live or die the moment after the film - he has nothing to live for. He
is no longer human, nor he belongs anywhere. Strong anti- consumerism
and anti-corporate statement presenting our true nature hidden in the
cellophane package of civilization. We are all savages!

While having Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio is a definite boon, what
really makes "The Revenant" a splendid cinematic experience is the
utmost care for visual and cinematography. It's a series of immersive
events taken with extreme care, minimal editing and a continuous shot
after continuous shot of wintry landscape as it witnesses revenge and
ordeal of savages.It tells the story of Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he fights against
beast, nature and fellow man to stay alive. There are a couple of other
subplots though Glass' perspective takes the focus. One can argue that
this is Leo's closest chance at Oscar in recent years, and it's hard
not to see why. He's an expert on conveying emotions with sheer
gestures and psychical attributes alone. If this movie is advertised as
actual survival show, Leo would make people believe it.On the other spectrum Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald is just equally amazing.
He presents a much different persona than his other roles, I admittedly
didn't recognize him for half of the movie. This is a brilliant act on
his part to showcase the brutality of the time. Domhnall Gleeson and
Will Poulter round up the crew nicely as duty bound captain and the
more inexperienced frontiersman. The average length of scene is
demanding and the cast delivers pleasantly.The other subplots happen simultaneously as Glass' predicament, they
could be highlighted more but this is just a slight scratch on the
narrative and also not to impose on the main story line. Its visual is
certainly a triumph in film making. There's no shortage of refinement
on the sequences, whether it's dialogues or action. It's a precise,
deliberate and unwavering presentation, captivating with its pronounced
details as well as slight whisper or howl of the winter.Few other movies manage to allure the audience into the world of the
movie with stern excellent production and acting, "The Revenant" is
truly breathtaking.

"The Revenant" is an adventure movie which combines very well drama
with suspense. In this movie we watch a man trying to survive after
being attacked from a bear. His hunting team after trying to keep him
with them they left him for dead. After this we watch him trying to
survive by himself in the forest facing a lot of problems.I really liked this movie due to its plot and for one more time because
of the interpretation of Leonardo DiCaprio who played as Hugh Glass the
person who is fighting for his survival. The direction which made by
Alejandro González Iñárritu was simply outstanding with a lot of good
action scenes which represented very well the feelings and the fight of
this person for the survival. I also liked the interpretation of Tom
Hardy who played as John Fitzgerald a member of Hugh Glass hunting
team. Hardy played a different kind of role from the roles that he
already has played and that was something very interesting to watch,
the result of course was equally good.Finally I believe that "The Revenant" is a very good movie to watch
since it gives you the feeling that you are a part of the movie,
feeling and understanding what obstacles has a person to go through in
order to survive. In addition to this you can simply understand what a
person can do and suffer if he has more important things to do than to
care for his own life.

Taking us back to the perilous American frontier of the early 19th
century, Alejandro G. Inarritu's The Revenant follows Leonardo
DiCaprio's protagonist and his epic story of survival and revenge. But
The Revenant is certainly not your typical romanticized Hollywood
revenge flick. It's a film that's based on true events, and (though it
admittedly diverges a bit too far from the actual story) it certainly
plays out like the tough, gory reality. As an unsuspecting viewer of
the film will progressively come to realize, The Revenant is not the
ordinary Hero vs. Villain story that they're used to seeing -- instead,
it's the story of one man's harrowing trek of resilience and discovery
to hunt down the man who did him wrong. The Revenant, of course, stars the more bankable than ever Leonardo
DiCaprio as Hugh Glass, a frontiersman on an 1823 fur trapping
expedition. When DiCaprio's Glass endures a most painful experience
with a grizzly bear about a half-hour into the film, Leo is thrown into
the role of a man who will do and endure anything as long as he can
still grab a breath. Yet Leo does much more than scream, cry, and eat
raw bison liver just to get his hands on that first Oscar. Quite the
contrary, DiCaprio's performance never feels forced or desperate, but
rather, the actor conjures up perhaps his most realistic and natural
performance to date. The excruciating pain and melancholic despair he
experiences deeply resonates with the audience, as we feel Glass'
unimaginable struggle with every one of DiCaprio's screams and shouts. Yet, even with everything that DiCaprio goes through to impressively
pull off the role of Glass, it's Tom Hardy's turn as antagonist John
Fitzgerald that truly steals the show on the acting front. As a
bigoted, greedy, and pugnacious bully, Fitzgerald is the kind of
villain we all instinctively loathe. On paper, Fitzgerald could be just
another archetype villain, yet Hardy masterfully adds complexity and
his own brand of unlikability to the character that makes us feel like
we're watching something original and compelling. Also included in The
Revenant's remarkable ensemble are Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Henry
and Will Poulter as the young Jim Bridger. Both Gleeson and Poulter
master each and every nuance to their respective character, ensuring
that both Henry and Bridger will not go down as forgettable as they
could have been in the hands of lesser talents. And last not but not
least, I can't discuss The Revenant's impressive ensemble without
bringing up Arthur RedCloud, the most delightful surprise that the film
has to offer in his role as the lovable Hikuc. But if we're pointing fingers at the most valuable member of The
Revenant's cast and crew, it has to be director and co-screenwriter
Inarritu. Following the critical acclaim of last year's Birdman, the
visionary filmmaker decided not to take a year or two off to bask in
his Oscar-winning glory. Instead, Inarritu came out bolder and more
ambitious than ever, attempting to orchestrate this film's notoriously
long and strenuous shoot to perfection. But it's thanks to Inarritu's
(allegedly irritating) fastidiousness that everyone put in the effort
that they did, and that it all paid off with a truly mesmerizing
finished product. Of course, the artistic glory of The Revenant can't be discussed
without lauding the masterwork of Emmanuel Lubezki. One of the best DPs
in the business, Chivo's coming off back-to-back Oscar wins for
Cinematography, and seems to be heading for a three-peat. Not only does
The Revenant include several of the intricate and action-packed
tracking shots that Lubezki is known for, but his capturing of the
beauty of the Canadian wilderness is absolutely stunning. Often, the
film feels like frame after frame of gorgeous scenery. With Inarritu's
and Lubezki's ambitiously risky and almost unprecedented choice of
filming only in natural light, Chivo manages to manipulate the amount
of light (or lack thereof) to construct some of the finest photography
in cinematic history. Ultimately, the aesthetic that Inarritu and
Lubezki create feels all too realistic, both brutally honest and
breathtakingly beautiful. And there's far more who deserve credit for making this film something
genuinely special. Ryuichi Sakamoto's and Alva Noto's original score
succeeds in both creating an appropriately mystical atmosphere and
adding to the tension of the film's grandest action sequences.
Production Designer Jack Fisk shows off some of his best work yet, with
his all too realistic-looking cabins, hauntingly beautiful church
ruins, and unique outdoor locations showing the man's impressive
artistic vision. Meanwhile, the costume, makeup, and hairstyling crews
give us many gems, including Glass' bear pelt and Fitzgerald's
partially scalped head. All of these visual components come together in
a way that is absolutely remarkable, creating one of the most harsh,
realistic, yet beautiful aesthetics ever put to film. As pretty as The Revenant is to look at, it's the scenes that will make
you want to look away that stick with the viewers the longest. But
that's just yet another strength to be found with The Revenant (though
maybe not so much for the weak-stomached). Some of the highlights
include the infamous bear mauling, a sequence that is breathtakingly
tense, disconcertingly realistic, and a triumph of filmmaking all at
once. And then there's the climactic fight sequence between the story's
two central characters, and it's much more uncompromising than what
audiences are used to -- there's no melodramatic staging here (though
some typical conveniently placed dialogue should be expected). Instead,
this blood-filled ax-on-knife fight is so brutally realistic that it
feels like watching authentic gladiatorial entertainment. And it's all
the more intense for it. The Revenant is unquestionably harsh when it
comes to its approach to violence, but that's also what makes it so
damn good.

After striking gold at the Academy Awards last year with 'Birdman',
Alejandro González Iñárritu is back with 'The Revenant', a tale of
revenge and suffering. 'The Revenant' has experienced a hard shoot,
Iñárritu said it would be all well and good to film in a studio, but
the film wouldn't have the same impact. Instead, the cast and crew shot
on location and experienced extreme weather conditions. This film is
particularly important for Leonardo DiCaprio who is overdue for an
Academy Award and should probably finally win this year. 'The Revenant'
has received 12 Oscar nominations and is expected to win a slew of them
and possibly the big awards. I found 'Birdman' unengaging and
pretentious at times and felt in a year where there were outstanding
films such as 'Whiplash' and particularly, 'Boyhood', it was a very
undeserving winner.'The Revenant' is a visually stunning film and it boasts many
outstanding sequences. It has some excellent central performances and
boasts original cinematography and an atmospheric score. Leonardo
DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are both mesmerising here and Iñárritu has
really developed as a director. The battle sequences are wonderfully
crafted and there are some beautifully shot landscapes to create the
film's atmosphere. My only gripes with 'The Revenant' are its pacing is
a little stretched at parts and its story is a little simplistic for a
156 minute running time. But the execution is where 'The Revenant' wows
and it really is a work of art.The acting is where 'The Revenant' is most likely to flourish at the
Academy Awards and Leonardo DiCaprio is stunning here. DiCaprio is a
fantastic actor anyway and deserved to win for 'The Wolf of Wall
Street', only he faced some fierce competition in that year in the form
of Chiwetel Ejiofor and Matthew McConaughey, the latter ultimately
taking the gong. His performance in 'The Revenant' is a very physical
one and he carries the film with just his mannerisms and pure torture
that his character is put through. Tom Hardy is also very good here,
perhaps not quite Oscar-worthy, but he makes for a very interesting
villain. His performance too is a very physical one and his character
is well-developed. The last time DiCaprio and Hardy met on-screen was
in Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' and they gel just as well here as
they did there. The ultimate showdown between both actors in this film
is breathtaking and is edge-of-the-seat entertaining. Domhnall Gleeson
and Will Poulter are in supporting roles for this film and give sound
performances.Whilst the story is a rather simplistic for its lengthy run time, it is
developed well enough so that one connects with the characters. This
film is well-and-truly a revenge thriller first and a Western second.
The suffering that DiCaprio's character experiences is at times,
shocking and he goes to any lengths to survive. The battle sequences
are especially mesmerising, particularly at the very beginning and the
mauling of DiCaprio by a bear is extremely well crafted and
frightening.Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography here is stunning and he will most
likely win his third Academy Award for this. Characters are generally
kept to the left side of the frame to give the audience a feel for
perspective and Lubezki's landscape shots are wonderful to behold and
really bring a sense into the desperate and desolate world that one
immerses themselves in. Although sadly illegible for the Academy
Awards, the score by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto here is endlessly
atmospheric and heartfelt. It is used sparingly, but whenever the score
is used it heightens the events being portrayed on-screen. Sakamoto has
recently been battling cancer so it's a welcome return to form here and
this is his first film score for an American film in a long time.Overall, 'The Revenant' is a very impressive film and technically
outstanding. It makes for a very satisfying watch and the combination
of DiCaprio and Hardy is a match made in heaven. Iñárritu's direction
is a lot more assured here and this is complimented by an atmospheric
score and beautiful cinematography. This is a much better effort
compared to 'Birdman' which very undeservedly took the top awards last
year. If this went on to win Best Picture, I would be fairly happy.
'Room' is the best film of the pack but it does shut out some audiences
who sadly won't appreciate it. 'The Revenant' is very impressive and
satisfying for those who stick with it. Watch it on the biggest screen
you can find!**** / ***** (Excellent) Read more reviews on thefilmmeister.com

The Revenant stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson.
Its about the story of Hugh Glass, and its road to revenge against
Fitzgerald. As i previously said, this movie has one of the best
cinematography I have ever seen. There are really long shots, and wide
shots throughout the movie and its mind blowing. Leonardo DiCaprio is
phenomenal, his performance its mainly physical, not really talkative.
I think Leo really does deserve the Oscar this time. Tom Hardy is also
great. All the actors make an amazing work in the movie, even that kid
from the maze runner. The story its really riveting as you want Hugh
Glass to succeed in his long and hard journey of revenge. There is a
scene with a bear, and its really something. The scene looks gross, and
bloody but in a really necessary way, and it is really realistic. The
only real flaw that I have is that the film makes some weird scenery
and it is understandable for the character, but it just came off as not
necessary. It does come off as pretentious but it really did not take
me out from the amazing journey of Glass. 9.5/10

I was utterly entranced for the entire length of this long, sad, and
starkly beautiful film and didn't want it to end. The action
sequencesbear attack, attacks by hostile Indians, struggles with other
natural elementstruly take the audience Right There with their
ultra-realistic cinematography, costume design, and sound effects. Very
good, often splendid acting by just about everyone, with special kudos
going to Will Poulter as young Jim Bridger, and, of course, DiCaprio as
protagonist Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy is also great as antagonist John
Fitzgerald, a character who, no matter how much the bad guy he is, is
still given a sprinkling of sympathetic qualities. The way that Glass
and Fitzgerald resemble each other in both appearance and certain
mannerisms is another interesting effect.I've noticed some complaints about THE REVENANT's length, and I can see
why many will find its 2.5 hours overwhelming and draggy in certain
places. The main reason why I can't quite give it ten shiners is that
its plot follows the same basic pattern of so many other western
vengeance dramas, particularly in its rather predictable ending. Still,
the unique details and twists keep this from really hurting the film.
The sheer number of supporting characters makes it hard to place who's
who; nevertheless, this was obviously hard to avoid and also leaves
room for multiple viewingsI'm sure many will be as eager as I am to
watch it again. Finally, some of the script/dialogue is rather flat and
does not convincingly evoke the 1820s; e.g., "Yep, the Indians are
always stealing our s__t!" Some other notable things about THE REVENANT:--Wonderful use of parallels in details such as the bear cubs left
motherless, the lone buffalo abandoned by the herd as it's devoured by
stalking wolves, and the old Indian left behind in the abandoned
village.--Amazing visuals of the Rocky Mountain setting and Glass's dream
sequences.--The fact that THE REVENANT is based upon a true story (taking many
liberties, of course) and that most of its primary characters were
actual people leaves room to read-up and dig a little deeper.

Set in 1823-24 in what is now South Dakota, Mexican filmmaker Alejandro
Iñárritu's The Revenant is loosely based on the experience of American
fur trapper Hugh Glass who miraculously survived a bear attack and
sought revenge against a Texas mercenary who abandoned him and killed
his son. Adapted from Michael Punke's book, "The Revenant: A Novel of
Revenge," and winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture, it is a
story of the resilience and endurance of a man fighting for survival
under extreme weather conditions. Shot with natural light in minus
forty-degree temperatures in Alberta, Canada, the film is a testament
not only to the skills of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski, but to
Inarritu's commitment to the authenticity of his craft.In the film, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a scout for trappers
employed by the Rocky Mountain Trading Company. In the opening
sequence, we learn that Glass was married to a Pawnee woman who was
killed by soldiers. The scene then shifts to the trader's campsite
where the men are attacked by warring Arikara Indians. The tribe, whose
numbers had been decimated by a smallpox epidemic, was eager to trade
pelts for horses and rifles but bore the scars of the white man's
encroachment on their land. In the attack, the trappers suffer heavy
casualties and only a few are left alive besides Glass: Captain Andrew
Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), Glass' half-Pawnee son Hawk (Forrest
Goodluck), young hunter Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and frontiersman
John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), all persuaded by Glass to attempt an
overland route back to their Fort Kiowa headquarters.Out hunting for food, Glass is viciously attacked by a bear and, though
clinging to life, is buried alive by Fitzgerald who also kills his son.
Though the bear is a CGI construction, the attack is stomach-churning
in its gruesomeness and brings the viewer into the middle of an animal
attack that has a startling feeling of reality. Amazingly regaining
consciousness, Glass crawls through freezing snow and chilling waters
to find Fitzgerald and revenge his son's murder. Surviving on scraps of
animal carcasses, he is sustained by mystical messages of encouragement
from his dead wife and the help of a Pawnee Indian who ends up being
hung from a tree by the French with a sign around his neck saying "We
are all savages." The Revenant, though not as emotionally involving as it should be,
meshes a powerful struggle for survival with elements of spiritual
awareness. Unfortunately, however, its spiritual message does not
include forgiveness and perpetuates the myth that wrongdoing can only
be redeemed by superior force. It is nonetheless a physically stunning
film whose natural beauty reminds us of the existence of a land with
forests, rivers, and streams that has not yet been, as author Charles
Eisenstein put it, "destroyed by development: cordoned off,
no-trespassed, filled in, cut down, paved over, and built up." Though
he has little dialogue, DiCaprio's performance is one of the best of
his long career and worthy of an Oscar nomination, his eyes and body
language expressing a fierce determination and strength of will. For
Glass, there is only one way out of it and that's through it. It is a
punishing test of endurance both for him and for the viewer.

Fresh off his Oscars for "Birdman," Alejandro González Iñárritu makes a
drastic change in scope and scale with "The Revenant," a period
survival drama set in the American frontier. But while the setting is
wildly different, Iñárritu is still flexing a lot of his same
filmmaking muscles. He really hones his unique cinematic stamp, thereby
forcing most viewers to determine just how big of fans they are of his
approach.Working again with back-to-back Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, Iñárritu
has executed another visually immaculate picture worthy of a heap of
technical awards. The challenge is the harrowing and brutal story
serves as a sometimes painful contrast to the beauty of the
craftsmanship.Leonardo DiCaprio takes the plunge into cinematic hell with Iñárritu as
Hugh Glass, the real-life early 19th century fur trapper and explorer.
The film tells of his part in a fur-trading expedition and his
legendary encounter with a grizzly bear, the man who left him for dead,
and his subsequent pursuit of revenge. Much of "The Revenant" is straightforward and grim. Iñárritu takes the
viewer on a journey with his camera as the expedition is attacked from
all sides by Arikara Native Americans in a series of gore-filled long
shots. The rest of the film doesn't shy away from portraying the
shoot-first savagery of the place and time, and also man's tumultuous
relationship with nature. There are so many times when nature
aggravates the situation but also times it alleviates it. Both nature
and man prove to be merciful despite their brutality.All these notions must be patiently synthesized from the film, which
languishes compared to the pacing of similar survival stories. Iñárritu
is far more interested in bringing poetry to the narrative than a
gripping intensity. There are plenty of captivating moments, but also
plenty of moments that exist as if solely to create a stunning visual
portrait or add length to convey additional brutality to the
circumstances of Glass' predicament. The role of Glass is as unglamorous as it gets, which is really what
sets it apart from the rest of DiCaprio's resume. Sure, it's showy, but
horrific-makeup-scars showy, not
sickly-charismatic-hair-perfectly-parted showy. So much of what
DiCaprio does is understated, even if Iñárritu's camera pronounces that
nuance. Of the other roles, Tom Hardy makes for an excellent antagonist as
Fitzgerald, the man who leaves Glass for dead (among other horrible
things). The character exists primarily to embody the far extreme of
greed and selfishness in this allegory about what motivates men, but
Hardy puts his stamp on it to be sure.Iñárritu and co-writer Mark L. Smith definitely aspire to a greater
intellectual purpose for this film, but the delivery is anything but
direct. Glass is constantly imagining his Native American wife
throughout the story, for example, but it's hard to connect with these
sparse moments of visual poetry. Yet "The Revenant" is still affecting
and thought-provoking, especially if you take the time to really
actively engage in viewing it, which is easier said than done given the
runtime and filmmaking style.A true experience of a film, "The Revenant" is so rich in production
values, and its best moments are when those values immerse the viewer
and inform the viewer's perspective on the story, rather than serve to
create some ambiguous visual poetry. It's not a complete package, but
it's an undeniable achievement.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more

Ever since the first teaser for The Revenant came out, I was hyped out
of my mind for this film. The amazing cinematography was already
apparent in that 1 minute clip and is an amazing achievement for
director Alejandro González Iñárritu . This was sure to be a cinematic
masterpiece but would the story and characters be up to par with the
visuals? Well, yes they are, but it's complicated...As seen in the trailers The Reveant is about a man named Hugh Glass,
played amazingly by Leonardo DiCaprio. Glass is traveling with a
hunting party who go out right before winter to collect pelts to sell.
Glass is responsible for the security of the companionship and has to
make some tough calls in doing so. After a tragedy that befell him and
his family, he never loses sight of his half-blood son Hawk. Suddenly, the hunting party is under attack by a group of natives who
force them to flee the scene and leave over twenty companions dead.
Glass has to guide the party back to their stronghold but not everyone
has much faith left in his judgment. Fitzgerald, portrayed by Tom
Hardy, openly critiques Glass and his half-blood son. Things take a
turn for the worse when DiCaprio's character is attacked by a bear in
what is one of the most intense, gruesome and gritty scenes I have ever
seen! The bear attack is a cinematic milestone on its own and is worth
the price of admission if you have a strong enough stomach! It's after
this attack that the story really picks up. When Fitzgerald kills Hawk, he leaves Glass in a hole in the ground to
die. It's at that point that the film turns into a tale of vengeance
and survival as DiCaprio's character has to find a way to survive in
brutal conditions on top of tracking down Fitzgerald to get his
revenge.What follows is a journey through a gorgeous and huge landscape, with
danger around every corner. DiCaprio has to fight the elements, hunger,
disease and death all while being hunted by natives. As said earlier, The Revenant is visually breathtaking. Action scenes
are often filmed in one shot that run for several minutes on end! It's
this choice of not cutting up shots, that makes the action all the more
intense (E.G. the bear attack) but more so for the drama! When DiCaprio
is fighting the cold, you feel like you're right there with him, laying
in the snow. When Glass is tending his gruesome wounds, you're cringing
up and feel the pain he's going through. I'll just say what has to be
said: DiCaprio has to win the Oscar this time! There is just no more
way around him! If the academy wants even more dedication from DiCaprio
before giving it to him, he's going to have to die, literally, while
acting. Tom Hardy is yet again on top of his game making him a serious
contender for an Oscar in the near future! To see a British man play an
American from the South, complete with the right accent and look, is
just a massive achievement for Hardy as an actor! The Revenant heavily relies on its sense of realism. In every aspect of
it's storytelling, the sense of realism is there. The action is
violent, gritty and bloody! The acting is in a realm above acting
because none of the actors are pretending... They are actually freezing
to death on screen in an unforgiving landscape and torturing weather! The movie is not flawless however. There is one problem regarding the
storytelling which I have to discuss. We as an audience are supposed to
be devastated when Hawk is killed. The problem is that he isn't really
likable as a character because he spends his time complaining and
doesn't do much else. Though the relationship between Glass and his son
is obviously that of a father and son but we never see them interact in
a playful or fun way. Which doesn't help redeem Hawk's blandness. Glass
is either harshly disciplining Hawk or they're hugging it out in
flashbacks. So when Hawk dies, you're not really emotionally invested
in what's happening because you don't care enough about Hawk to really
be heartbroken. What does pull you into it however, is DiCaprio's
performance! You really want to see him get his revenge but not because
of what happened to his son, but because what he has to go through to
get it. And while that's a major compliment to DiCaprio, it's also a
flaw in the storytelling. Another minor detail which I noticed was that the dubbing of certain
lines really didn't match the movement of the lips. A lot of the native
characters have this problem. Granted, their lines are all Indian which
is really difficult to pull off given the use of long consecutive
shots. However, this problem didn't occur for DiCaprio which is another
compliment for him as an actor. In summary I can say that The Revenant has met my expectations and that
despite one apparent problem in the storytelling, The Revenant is a
cinematic triumph! With amazing cinematography, superior acting and
heart stopping action, The Revenant is a film you can't afford not to
see in theaters!

Of course we can tease that DiCaprio has turned Inarritu's latest
majestically-looking Western revenge saga as his almost-perfect
Oscar-draw with all the exacting physical tribulations: severely mauled
by a bear, being buried alive, worming his way in the wild, floating on
the raging torrent, eating raw fish and bison liver, falling from a
cliff and keeping warm inside a dead horse's cavity, etc. etc. some of
those are real deal, others are cinematic creation, but there is no
shame for an actor challenges himself to the extreme in order to win an
Oscar award, although to many a cinephile, most of time Oscar looks
like a joke, but for those whose career is making movies, getting the
recognition from their peers is a huge honour and temptation rather
difficult to refuse, also at least Leo does all those impressive stunts
in his film instead of in the tiresome self- campaign.Last year's Oscar winner Inarritu returns with an even more
grandstanding showpiece, running over 2 and a half hours, the narrative
is fairly simple, inspired by a true event, in 1820s, a member of a fur
trading expedition, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), survives a deadly bear
attack and embarks on an astounding journey to avenge the killer of his
Pawnee son Hawk (Goodluck). Basically, it is an eye- opening survival
tale plus an old-fashion Western ending, but under Inarritu's
perfectionist and harsh working ethos, DP Emmanuel Lubezki's
mind-blowing visual grandeur (I'm talking about THE TREE OF LIFE level
of magnificence, even the sky is not the limit for this guy!) and a
fearless cast headed by DiCaprio and Hardy, we are awed to witness
Hugh's entire ordeal with admiration and inconceivability. One sure
thing, apart from Leo's Oscar chance, is Lubezki is on the fast track
to fulfil his hat trick after GRAVITY (2013) and BIRDMAN (2014), one
can only feel particularly sorry for Roger Deakins, who might lose to
the same guy three times (consecutively) after his 13th nomination for
SICARIO (2015) and still be Oscar-less.Beyond the shadow of a doubt, this year finally belongs to Leonardo
DiCaprio, personally I am not a fan of bodily transformation or
endeavour, because the highest achievement of acting is reflected
through an actor's expressions and articulation, to convey one's subtle
or un-subtle emotions, other things are all bells and whistles, but
after beholding all those exploits, one has to surrender to a feeling
of commiseration, give Leo the damn Oscar!An interesting side-note is that every time DiCaprio is nominated for
an Oscar in leading role, there is always a collateral supporting
nomination for his male co-star, first is Alan Alda in THE AVIATOR
(2004), then, Djimon Hounsou in BLOOD DIAMOND (2006), next Jonah Hill
in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), and this time the fluke comes upon
Tom Hardy (three out of four, save Hounsou, their nominations happen
out of nowhere without any significant precursors), who plays Hugh's
nemesis John Fitzgerald, although it is a very dark character, Hardy
generates great intimidation but as a whole not exceptionally superior
to his other works, so the nomination could be conceived as a
career-boost for his consistent output and a banner year in 2015 (with
MAD MAX: FURY ROAD and LEGEND), although his co-star Domhnall Gleeson,
has an even more staggering line-up (EX MACHINA, STAR WARS: EPISODE VII
- THE FORCE AWAKENS and BROOKLYN).After my tepid reception towards BIRDMAN, THE REVEMANT complacently
shows more potentialities of Inarritu as a visionary auteur, his
compassion for the indigenous and scorn to the Western colonisation,
are all admiring, only if he could underplay the flourishes a little
bit and find some source material more pioneering other than boosting
self-worth and endurance, that's my little wishful thinking.

Occasionally a cinema-goer views a film which acts as recompense for
all of the others which fall flat and leave us disappointed. A film
which offers an experience, and reminds us that a truly great picture
must be seen in the cinema, on film. 'The Revenant' is one of these.An American fur-trapping expedition in Montana in the early 19th
century is cut short by an attack by Native Americans leaving the group
of trappers stranded in hostile territory. Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio), the groups tracker, is critically wounded and left behind at
the behest of John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who pleads that it is for the
good of the group. The expedition leader Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall
Gleeson) orders Fitzgerald and a contingent including Jim Bridger (Will
Poulter) to bury the wounded Glass as soon as he succumbs to his
wounds. The group ultimately leave Glass for dead, who then must make
the journey home on his own - to exact revenge.Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu executes another visionary project which
raises the bar for modern cinema yet again. 'The Revenant' has a near
unique aesthetic which was created with minimal CGI (a major coup) and
an incredibly well organised team which shows us a very real world and
allows us to focus on performance and character rather than one of the
many things which could distract owing to poor quality.The cinematography in this film is of apex quality - a certainty to
secure a 3rd Oscar for cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, a master of
his craft. A series of incredible set pieces remind us of why 'Birdman'
won best picture. 'The Revenant' is easily one of the most beautiful
and impressive pieces of filmmaking ever committed to the silver
screen. In order to maximise the viewing pleasure, it is suggested that
a viewer finds the largest screen in town.Where the film falls down is when it is compared to the original film
'Man in the Wilderness' starring Richard Harris. In the original, our
protagonist has a series of flashbacks of his life which inspire him to
continue on his seemingly impossible journey. These flashbacks are
critical in order to understand the resilience of the beset Glass. In
the re-imagining, our hero has a far clearer and more tangible
motivation - revenge. This renders these flashback relatively
unimportant and contrived - and one cannot help but deem them a pale
imitation of the imagined familial reunion in 'Gladiator'.The film also seems to have a compulsive need to outdo itself
constantly and continue to expand the action past the boundaries of
plausibility, which is perhaps a requisite for a modern Hollywood
picture. In the original, our hero merely makes the journey - an
absurdity in itself. This is enabled by seemingly super-human healing
abilities. In the newer version, our hero has recovery rates to rival
Wolverine from X-Men. He also undertakes a series of breathtaking feats
including extended hand to hand combat and a sequence where the
character literally 'jumps the tree' - a set- piece which could make
Michael Bay blush. The quality of the film earns it a wide margin of
error on this part - but it is certainly tested.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a benchmark portrayal in the lead role. The
performance does have an element of 'cut & paste' from previous roles.
Extreme pain is an emulation of 'Cerebral palsy phase' from 'The Wolf
of Wall Street' and steely determination is identical to aggressive
denial in 'Inception'. I would not hold out for an Oscar from this film
owing to the fact that very little is new in terms of testing his depth
and/or scope, perhaps his next venture will gain him that elusive
statue.Tom Hardy steals the show with a brooding performance as the villainous
Fitzgerald. A character who has a pragmatism which, for the more honest
viewer, may be easier to identify with than one would like to admit.
Hardy apparently lost out on being in 'Suicide Squad' owing to shooting
delays - which I trust is a tiny price to pay when the final product
was shown.Special mention has to be made for the fresher faces in Domhnall
Gleeson (Dredd, Star Wars: Episode VII) and Will Poulter (Son of
Rambow, We're the Millers). One hopes these actors have laid a
foundation upon which to build in the near future which may lead to
more challenging roles and/or lead roles. This author has had a chance
to observe first hand Gleeson giving a sterling performance on stage
which dwarfs everything which he has delivered on screen - we wait with
baited breath for him to gain the chance to exhibit his, as of yet,
hidden talents.One of the better films of 2015 and of the century. Not just a must
watch film but a film which must be watched on the big screen.

As most IMDb.com contributors, I have seen my share of Western movies.
Most of them tend to glorify the conquest of the American West and
contribute to the romantic image a lot of people still have of the Wild
West. This movie is both a Western and an anti-Western: it tells us
some very profound things about the way the United States was shaped in
those early years (the story is set in the 1820's), but at the same
time it does so in a very unromantic way. Maybe that's one reason why
this movie has done so well with the jury that decides on the Oscar
nominations: it's an epic Western, a genre held in high esteem in
Hollywood history, but it is very much a Western revisited. The
improbable chain of events frontiersman Hugh Glass is involved in, can
sometimes get quite improbable: some scenes were so unlikely it drew
laughs from the audience. Surely it is not a spoiler to mention that
Mr. Di Caprio sleeps inside a horse (after having disembowled it) or
has a close encounter with a grizzly bear. But also minor elements seem
unlikely: e.g., how do you keep your gunpowder dry after having been
submerged and swept away for miles on end by a glacial river ? Hugh
Glass is, in many respects, very much a one dimensional character: the
lone hero, lusting for revenge. But is doesn't do the movie justice
just to leave it at that easy criticism. At the same time it is a quite
profound movie. What moved me most about it was the way nature, and
life itself, is portrayed. It is unforbidding, starkly beautiful and
harsh and goes it's own course, indifferent to mankind. The
overwhelming beauty of nature, the mountains, the rivers, is, besides
Mr. Hardy and Mr. DiCaprio, a main character in this movie. There are
many moving scenes where director Alejandro Inarritu draws our
attention to just that: sometimes he just lets us watch the river, the
moon or the trees. The way Hugh Glass slightly touches the dead horse
as a sign of respect for being his 'host' is strangely compelling,
although it's a detail in a movie that grips you right from the start
with its daredevil adventure and gruesome action... Oscar experts have
correctly noticed that this movie is also expertly well edited - the
action scenes, especially the one where Mr. Di Caprio meets a grizzly
bear are very, very skillful. A special mention also for the
cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki: he makes the 1820's really come
alive and adds reality to the scenes by using natural light and
allowing his camera lens to be fogged or splattered with blood...

Frame by frame, this movie is one of the most visually outstanding
films I have ever seen. The amount of time and physical toll required
by the cast and crew to film this movie in mostly natural light and
less than ideal conditions paid off; every shot was breathtaking. In
terms of the film as a whole, the plot was not overly captivating;
however, when compared to the rather anti-climatic novel by Punke, the
creative direction the writers took with the source material was as
successful as I could have asked for. The performances by DiCaprio and
Hardy were outstanding and certainly award worthy. Iñarritu's unique
flair and visual genius shone through with another outstanding
direction, and arguably the best cinematographer in the business right
now in Lubezki made a unique visual experience unlike any the industry
has ever seen.

Inarritu has spent a lots of time polishing this turd. Some of the
artistic shots are absolutely fabulous. They have obviously had the
second unit out in the snow for a great long time shooting scenic trees
and snow. The rest is a half-written 30 minute script, packed out with some nice
scenery and some hyper-violent scenes to make sure you don't fall
asleep. There is no need for a lot of the extremity of the violence.
Human vs Human, Animal vs Human, Human vs Animal, all ridiculously
bloody and disgusting for no real reason.If Leo does finally get an Oscar for this he should hand it straight
back because it will have been based purely on pity rather than on the
actual performance involved in this film.

Just a year after impressing film fans across the world with big-small
scaled existential theater story of Birdman, award-winning director
Alejandro G. Iñárritu returns to the big screen with 12-time Oscar
nominee The Revenant. To say that The Revenant is something different
would be an understatement. Here, the sometimes claustrophobic hallways
of the New York Theatre is replaced by the wide open fields of nature
in North America in the early 19th century. And with that, let me stop
the comparisons and look at The Revenant as the unique piece of cinema
history that it surely will become.Storywise we are served a rather simple story about redemption,
survival and savagery in the meeting of cultures with the meeting
between white frontiersmen and North American native Indians. If you
think this backdrop sounds familiar, then you are right. Despite it
being told with Iñárritu's sense for detail and with fierce brutality,
the story might very well be the film's weakest asset. The middle
section drags on a bit too long and it is balancing on the edge of
simply becoming an "oh what can we expose Leo to now" story. They are
one more extreme situation away from crossing this line before a
thrilling and extremely satisfying third half takes over the action!What the film's story doesn't deliver, the cinematography sure does.
Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki is surely the guy to follow right now; in 2013
he placed us in space with Sandra Bullock with Gravity, in 2014 he made
us follow every step taken in Birdman, and now he takes us to the open
plains, narrow forests and brutal struggles of Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh
Glass in The Revenant. His mix of picture perfect nature scopes and
extreme close-ups of fights and heavy breaths combined with his almost
arrogantly perfect use of natural lighting makes the film an absolute
joy to behold! Quite simply one of the most beautifully filmed films I
have ever seen. It will be difficult to look beyond Chivo for the third
year in a row when the Oscar for best cinematography is awarded in a
month from now. However, the constant use of blood, water and breath
hitting the lens ended up as more of a distracting gimmick in my eyes
reminding me of the fact (that you always forget) that all of this is
carefully staged artistry and not the raw brutality of nature that you
are witnessing. With that in mind, my hopes are still high for Roger
Deakins' work in Sicario to be awarded. As Hugh Glass, Leonardo DiCaprio groans, sweats, bleeds and yells his
way towards his long-awaited Oscar for best actor. It is a tour de
force performance displaying the sheer pain and unstoppable desire for
redemption and survival in every single movement, sound or breath made
by him during the full 150 minutes running time. Is it the best
performance of his career? Perhaps not. Will he win the Oscar this
year? Quite possibly yes! It simply seems to be his year with no other
real standout performance of the year. In the supporting roles Tom
Hardy and perhaps especially Domhnall Gleeson continues to establish
themselves as some of the most exciting still-to-be-super-star-actors
in Hollywood right now (if they hadn't done that already). Tom Hardy is
an explosion of pent up anger, fear and brutality waiting to go off in
a constantly imminent eruption and he steals the show every single time
he is in the frame! Gleeson, as the
his-father-bought-him-the-title-captain of the cavalry, is really
growing into a forceful actor with a presence that jumps off the screen
with surprising power and relevance.When all is said and done, though, more than anything The Revenant is a
showcase of what we are able to achieve technically today. From the
mind-blowing, awe-inspiring cinematography to the frighteningly
life-like animations of a certain bear, this feels like good friends
Iñárritu and Lubezki letting us all know just how ground-breaking,
hard-working and inspiringly devoted pioneers of the cinematic universe
they are. Luckily for them they shoot with anything but blanks, and as
such they succeed in having you captured and mesmerised despite a quite
trivial story. Best film of the year? That I am not sure of. Most
impressive production of the year? Without a doubt and probably of the
last couple of years as well. A film that will serve as reference for
our technological development for many, many years.

Well, I am one of those guys that truly believe that Leo should have
taken an Oscar for quite some time now. I am guessing he will get it
for this one but this won't be his best work. Overall, the film was
really really good. Breathtaking photography and realistic as hell in
every aspect, from everyday life to the fighting scenes (especially the
one with the bear).I am still trying to wrap my head around the kind of quick recovery
that Leo had, after being attacked by the bear, but it's OK. I mean,
one of his fingers was stripped of its skin and then it was OK after I
don't know, a month or something, which would be hard even for
Wolverine! Despite that, some of the scenes in the movie were really really clever
and breathtaking, like the scene with the horse, the bear fight and a
couple more. I would say that the movie could have been 20 minutes
shorter with no effect on the plot whatsoever, but overall it was a
very good movie!

I watched this and the Hateful eight back-to-back, and I enjoyed this
film much better. The directing is brilliant because the way that this
film is shot the images are a piece of artwork in themselves. The
director use a long shot duration and couple this with a good usage of
sound the film is brilliant in it's directing style. The performances
from the actors are also brilliant, Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic in
this film because the performance that he gives as Hugh Glass is very
good, even though he doesn't speak much but this reminds me of the
character of Jason Bourne with the protagonist who hardly speaks. Tom
Hardy is also fantastic, because both actors add a sense of realistic
vibe to each character. However this is not a flawless film in my
opinion because I have a hard time believing that Hugh Glass would have
survived a bear attack of that scale if it was that brutal like film
makes out. The other thing I have a problem with is the final fight
although well shot, the fight would again have resulted in both
characters being dead because Hugh wouldn't have had several knife
wounds without a lot of blood. Other than that this is a perfect film
and is with anyone's money to go and watch because this is brilliant.

24 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza, Dorchester Tonight - The
Revenant. I looked up the meaning of the word Revenant 'A person who
has returned, especially supposedly from the dead' and that sums up
this film exactly. I heard many differing opinions about this film
before I went to see it so went with a very open mind. It's astonishing
how a story told on screen with so little dialogue can capture your
concentration and enchant your mind, Revenant did just that. Not for
the squeamish, this film has lots of blood and gore, expertly displayed
against the backdrop of winter, nothing makes its point more that the
sight of red blood on pure white snow. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh
Glass, a fur trader who is savagely mauled by a bear and left for dead
by his companions, but as the title of the film suggests he does not
die and we follow his desperate struggle to survive against the
elements, the Indians and those who wish ill of him. A very capable
supporting cast including Tom Hardy as Fitzgerald, a man looking out
for only his own interests to the detriment of all around him. Some
beautiful camera footage combined with a strong moody score and I think
this film will probably secure one of two of the Oscars it's being
nominated for.

The opening scenes of this movie are awesome! Incidentally: the
wonderful cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki had already my attention
in his film "Sleepy Hollow." With an enhanced aesthetic sense, Lubezki
now presents us with scenes that will - for sure - in memory of all the
spectators. The Director Alejandro González Iñárritu leads the show
safely and to my surprise bet on a cast of mostly unknown actors like
Forrest Goodluck who give us a masterful interpretation. Wild! "We are
all savages" was written in a sign in the neck of an Indian hanged by
French traders ... Could we answer this question: are we all savages if
we are subjected to those extreme conditions: cold, hunger, thirst,
death perspective at all the 24 hours a day ? As the main actor
Leonardo Di Caprio: splendid performance! Incidentally, Di Caprio
matures each film he performs and soon he will have his name engraved
on the Hall of the Major Actors of All Time ... Nature: Who can will
win it? Animals? Men? Make your bets... On a scale of 1 to 10 my vote
is 9.

The movie direction and picturing are awesome but the story is a bit
long . The ending isnot bad and not good either , it needed to be
longer with a massive final fight that goes with the movie. Tom Hardy
more than nailed it .Leo at first glance was good but after another thought he was awesome
considering that he almost didn't speak a word and communicated every
feeling exquisitely .The music really goes with the movie.The movie's slow pace is what makes you await a better finally .But i
didn't regret paying for it and i would watch it again .Actually and it
is killing me to say so , Tom hardy nailed it more than leo but let's
face the fact , Tom had lots of lines compared to Leo who almost spoke
two or 3 lines.I guess both did a great job and Leo deserves an Oscar
for at least dedication.

The Revenant is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and
an outstanding cast. It's an action packed, intense and very dramatic
film that takes us in to a very overwhelming journey of Hugh Glass, a
man who was left for dead and fights for survival, it depicts war in a
very accurate, blunt light that will keep you at the edge of your seat.
The film does tend to linger, a lot of scenes are dragged out, going on
for far too long when the audience really just wants to keep the story
moving, there were also a lot of dream sequences for Glass that were
cheesy, to say the least, and I didn't find them effective in being
heartwarming or conveying the characters emotions. The cast is
outstanding, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of the most flawless
performances of his career, playing a character more emotional,
vulnerable than any other role he's done before, the best scenes are
the few between him and Tom Hardy, they both play of each other very
well and their is a certain chemistry evident that made these parts
very effective. Though it has its flaws, Alejandro González brings us
an incredibly unique and inspired film that was brought to life from
his incredible vision, I would recommend the Revenant to anyone looking
for a good drama or adventure. After a member of his own team leaves him for dead, Hugh Glass fights
for survival and hunts for revenge. Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio

The Revenant (2015)Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu The Revenant follows the true
story of the frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was raped
by a wild Grizzly Bear (no not really, just attacked, although in some
shots it... never mind, lets just say he's hurt very badly) and left
for dead in the wilderness in the 1820's.From its opening, the film establishes a cold and brutal environment
seen through beautiful long takes and stunning, vivid landscapes, which
all work together to convey a tremendously unsettling unpredictability
from start to finish. Inarritu clearly utilises the skills he picked up
from Birdman and puts them to even better use here. This is a cinematic
film in every sense of the word from its incredibly wide and immersive
visuals which, at times, make you feel surrounded by action, to its
loud, at some points, booming score and terrific performances.Speaking of which, if this is the film that finally gets Leo that
Oscar, I for one will be happy. He is perfect. His co-star Tom Hardy
demonstrates an unusually cruel yet as usual hard to understand
performance, I must admit the subtitles at my screening were for once a
welcomed aide in deciphering the Hardy grumble. That being said,
together with Domhnall Gleeson (who by the way has probably had the
best year of his career already) who also does a great job in this
movie, the cast all round was pretty spectacular.Okay, now to some of the bad. First off, it's long... very long. At two
hours and thirty-six minutes the movie does test the viewers patients,
especially when every scene is colder and more painful than the one
before. However if you enjoy watching Leonardo DiCaprio going from a
bad situation to a worse for 156 minutes, this won't bother you. I will
admit that the film slows down at a point where I felt it didn't need
to and so begins to drag, but DiCaprio's performance was strong enough
to keep me engaged through the entire run time, however I also have to
acknowledge that this won't be the case for everyone.Secondly, in at least two dialogue scenes, the person talking was
clearly not the voice we were hearing, since the sound and the moving
mouth were completely out of sync. I'm not quite sure if this was a
stylistic choice, since the likelihood of it having accidental slipped
through editing seems unimaginable, but In any event, it completely
pulled my attention away from the film and made me wonder what the hell
was going on.In truth, this is a film unlike any that I've ever seen; the visuals
alone are incredible to the point where I have no idea how they were
able to capture them with a camera. (I mean the bear scene, how did
they film that? No seriously... how? Watch it, tell me, I need an
answer.) If that isn't impressive enough it is worth pointing out that
the movie was made without the use of studio lighting, that means: the
sun, the moon, live fires and that's it. Additionally you will never
have the right to feel cold after watching this film, ever. However
cold you think you could be, Hugh Glass was probably colder. It is
abundantly clear that this movie was made for the big screen and
demands to be viewed as such, so go watch it, go watch it big.The Revenant: 8.4/10

The Revenant is a beautifully shot movie, the wide camera pans and
focus on the scenery make it a joy to watch and keeps your attention
for the full 2 hour 40 minute run time.However i found it somewhat lacking in the story department, don't get
me wrong the acting is spot on 10/10 especially Leonardo Dicaprio and
Tom Hardy they have played there roles to the fullest. yet i found my
self a little lost when it came to the story as it appeared to me as a
long stretched out revenge story.My final verdict was that the movie is very enjoyable to watch the
first time yet a second screening may seem tedious within a short time,
therefore i am giving the movie an 8 / 10.

The Bear Necessities. The Passion of the Leo. Or, (my personal
favourite), Quaaludes: The Movie. I knew something was amiss when I
caught myself drumming up doofus monikers for Alejandro González
Iñárritu's gruelling frontier follow-up to his Oscar-winning Birdman,
rather than being immersed in its sweeping, blistering journey. On
paper, everything was in place for a rugged masterpiece. So, watching
The Revenant, why was my disrespectful mind still fumbling for
pic-in-ic basket puns instead of being mesmerized by poor "Heyyyyy
Lee-o"? Arguably, in the face of the unrepentant agony on screen, my mind
overcompensated with silliness. It's a decent point. Sadly, 'point' is
another word that consistently elbowed its way into my brain - as in,
"what's the?". Like Werner Herzog's similarly Sissyphissean
Fitzcarraldo, Iñárritu subjects his cast and crew to comparable
suffering to the story's characters to feel the weight of real
adversity. But Fitzcarraldo was governed by a gleaming beacon of a core
idea meditating on the sacrifices warranted for art. The Revenant
anchors itself on wilful doubt. And, like its craggy, icy terrain, it's
hard to find solid footing therein. The Revenant is not a poor film. In fact, it teeters so close to
masterpiece that its slew of creative decisions standing in the way
make it all the more frustrating for having opened the the conversation
of grandeur, rather than simply settling for pulpy survival epic. As a
sensorial experience, Iñárritu's work here is astonishing, almost
unprecedented. Indeed, there's an argument to be made for Canada being
the most worthwhile 'Best Actor' candidate here, as, on several levels,
it's nature that's really the star of the show.
Superstar-cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's famous use of only natural
lighting is astonishingly evocative. A sumptuous barrage of whirling
snow squalls and rivers serenely dribbling amidst sprawling tree
trunks, Lubezki delivers - hyperbole-free - some of the most
exquisitely expressive wildlife panoramas ever captured on film here.
Pair the stunning visuals with Ryûichi Sakamoto and Alva Noto's sparse,
agonizingly moving musical score, and we're reminded that 'take your
breath away' is more than an expression. But Iñárritu loves his dichotomies, and with such beauty inevitably
comes suffering. And here's where the 'but' comes in. Iñárritu strives
for rugged verisimilitude at all costs - dialogue is naturalistic,
muddy, and almost nonexistent; performances are beleaguered yet
unshowy, each actor ground down to the nub, exposing the shards of
truth therein. However, the execution is uneasily disjunctive with
Iñárritu's natural flamboyance as a filmmaker. Fishing for connective
tissue, Iñárritu sprinkles in inane, surrealistic dream
sequences/flashbacks of Glass' ethereal First Nations wife. This sort
of preening pretentiousness fit the smarmy absurdity of Birdman
perfectly, but it's cloying and distracting here, and the pacing
lurches as consequence. As such, many of the film's livelier sequences - a visually
jaw-dropping assault on the frontiersmen by a First Nations tribe,
fraught with kinetically swooshing bloodshed, is the most memorable -
juxtapose their grit and hyper-violence with balletic cameras and
concussive sound editing. This tension lends the scene a curiously
detached, almost adolescent playfulness, which sabotages its visceral
integrity. Several scenes of Glass' ruthless survival tactics play for
unintended laughs - I dare you to watch him disembowel a horse and
sleep in its carcass without the word 'Tauntaun' gallivanting through
your mind. The same goes for the film's definitive setpiece: Glass'
grisly mauling by bear. The duelling tensions of ferocious realism and
ostentatious showiness never quite click, leaving the viewer in sensory
overload between DiCaprio's squeals of pain and the noxiously
claustrophobic camera-work and (thankfully) CGI bear. I should have
felt ill from the scene's graphic intimacy. Instead, my brain
incessantly chanted "BEAR FIGHT", a-la Anchorman, as I waited for the
noise to end. This brings us to DiCaprio. He's a stupendous actor, investing 300% in
agonizing, method torment here. In fact, the shoot is so tangibly
harsh, it's hard to distinguish DiCaprio's acting from simply reacting
to the abominable circumstances he is thrust into. Sadly, Iñárritu's
insistence on broad characterization - Glass as a force of nature -
does DiCaprio no favours. We are given no character backstory, almost
no dialogue, no character arc, and virtually no means of personal
connection to Glass apart from his affective suffering, and DiCaprio's
star appeal. While The Martian continually fought to build character
and connection throughout solitude, DiCaprio's work increasingly feels
less like a performance and more an episode of Man vs. Wild (and even
Grylls peppers humour and humanity throughout) - an entirely physical
journey of abject asking audiences to spend two and a half hours with a
man they know virtually nothing of apart from his grunts and winces.
It's a tragic waste.Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson do their best to amend this opacity.
They're superbly, furiously emotive, both tenaciously craving moral
order amidst the madness of the woods. It's a shame Iñárritu doesn't
focus more on their relationship than Glass. It's more of a shame that
marble-mouthed Hardy's speech (a SPEECH! So many words! I missed them
so!) - "God is a squirrel, and I ate that motherf*cking squirrel"?! -
is so indecipherable; the film could ravenously use more of its
delicious deliriousness. Most disappointing is, stirring visual poetry aside, how thematically
empty The Revenant's antiquated, macho parable of survival and
vengeance feels. Flourishes fish for mythology- subverting subtext - a
far more interesting subplot involving a First Nations band searching
for an abducted girl, and the slippery politics of bartering with
French Canadian trappers - but are unceremoniously jettisoned for more
long takes of Glass groaning. Gorgeous or not, it's hard not to call
Iñárritu's bluff, and assume he set out in the woods to find meaning in
the suffering of Hugh Glass, only to conclude, panting in the snow, as
robbed of closure as his hero. But, like Glass, Iñárritu finds as much
beauty in his journey as irresolution in his destination. And that is
comforting in itself.-7/10

By now almost every movie lover knows that The Revenant , winner of 3
Golden Globe Awards, and nominated for 12 Academy Awards, has been
described as an endurance test so tortuous some crew quit. "Revenant"
connotes bringing back from the dead and that is exactly what happens
in this three-hour film. Hugh Glass, the real-life tracker and fur
trapper, managed to survive what was almost unsurvivable, but
permanently changed. Pushing the boundaries of physical stamina,
Leonardo DiCaprio is almost certain to win the Academy Award for his
raw and harrowing portrayal of Glass. The viewer comes out asking "How
could he possibly do that?" But The Revenant is so much more than a
struggle of man against nature, primal and intense, or a tale of
vengeance. Read the entire review at: www.unhealedwound.com and let me

I don't usually write review's, bt i couldn't resist from doing so. As
everyone already know DiCaprio is an exceptional actor of the century.
However this movie n his acting was beyond excellence. The execution
was mind blowing and the way the character was depicted was simply
unbelievable. Mind you, this movie isn't meant for the weak as some
scenes are really gory. I decided to take a look on the bts,n i was
astounded to know he actually did eat all those disgusting raw meats on
sets.. (that's not a joke)n sleeping is a horse carcass.. (who on earth
can even think of doing something like that in real life, let alone for
movies)..But yes, DiCaprio certainly did the impossible.I've always
been a fan of true story,though some stories are altered by movie
makers to give it a boost!! All I can say, he deserves all the awards
on earth for this movie..Bravo!!!its a must must watch for movie goers.

The Revenant It was a long film, 147 minutes by my count, 147 minutes
wasted, I could have done so much, go move on Facebook or even sleep,
but everyone said it was the film that such a Leonardo DiCaprio would
take the Oscar.  It would have been better having gone to UPA, but with
the crisis, he preferred to continue wandering same. At least I could
see the beautiful trees with snow in the background, but it was the
same background always, in every scene, it WAS THE SAME TREES WITH
SNOW. If this is the film that will win the Oscar, the harvest was bad
at all. This film shows how up early can be bad if he had not gone
hunting bear without help, while everyone was sleeping, have continued
just sleeping or have asked for "5 more minutes," WOULD NOT HAVE FILM!
I hope the win bear the Oscar, he is the one who deserved that really
dedicated and struggled for it, he gave his all until the skin, to play
that role for only 10 minutes smashing the Leonardo DiCaprio.

What a great production! Cinematography is amazing, showing all the
beauty and the danger of nature. Camera movements and editing are also
very skillful. Leonardo DiCaprio in the main role, a trekker who knows
both nature and Indians deeply, and Tom Hardy as despicable Fitzgerald
lead the great cast. The brutal story has the same spirit of another
snowy Western that depicts the fight for surviving, Sydney Pollack and
Robert Redford's "Jeremiah Johnson", but with some very realistic
scenes that probably could not be made in the 70's. The spectator feels
suffocated. The only drawback of the fabulous production is that the
unrealistic recovery of DiCaprio's character does not fit to the harsh
and much more realistic tone of the movie.

The direction of this movie is stunning. The movie starts with an
attack that is the most exciting since Last of the Mohicans. One is
really placed in the thick of things with the expert cinematography and
direction. The bear attack is unbearably terrifying. Story: There is more to the story than just making it home after being
mauled and left for dead. It has a significant Native American aspect.
Politically correct in handling the Native American portrayals for a
21st century movie, the villains, murderers of women and children and
rapists are mostly the French soldiers and trappers and the main bad
guy is named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The only thing I didn't like about
the story is why only 2 of them went out to look for Fitzgerald. Also
the fight scene at the end was just overkill. Made it end in a formula
Western way when it should have been above than that.Acting: Acting is generally good. Leonardo is convincing in his pain
hunger and suffering in the snow and freezing water. Give him an Oscar
just for the physical hardship alone. The mainly British supporting
cast is good too. Will Poulter is good as the kind of dimwit. The main
problem with the casting is that some of them look alike. Better to
have had some with different colored hair and no beard for some. The
Captain and Fitzgerald look a bit alike. Tom Hardy as the villain
mumbles. Couldn't understand most of what he said. Unnecessary to have
such a thick accent when the others were speaking more or less
normally. A gut wrenching and exciting film.

First and foremost I know that storytelling is an (if not the most)
essential part of filmmaking, but when I use the term in my title here
I refer to the superb cinematography, the top-notch acting performances
and the all-round exquisite film language used by Iñárritu. The only part that pushed my rating down to an eight (which is of
course still a marvellous score) was the storytelling. This is a very
straight-forward narrative with a very clear beginning, middle and end.
That is not necessarily a bad thing but in this movie I sort of lost my
interest a little bit in the middle of it, albeit very briefly. The
comeback of Hugh Glass to the civilised world seemed stretched out a
bit too thin for me. I get that meeting a friendly First Nation, who is
later lynched, is an important narrative element in order to not
portray these people as just the "bad guys" in the story. However, this
sequence felt highly superfluous to me. The beginning and the ending
were much stronger though quite predictable. But as is done too often,
much of this is forgiven through the magic of the words "based on a
true story". So the story, in all its simplicity, left me a bit
disappointed. Luckily Iñárritu hits a home run on every other aspect of his movie.
The imposing landscapes and the overall look of the film, which somehow
just exudes the cold, effortlessly draw you into the movie. The
cinematography is truly breath-taking. As are Iñárritu's signature long
tracking shots which add to the realism. This sense of gritty reality
is best felt during the fight scenes. Especially during the final
climactic duel between Glass and Fitzgerald, where it is nearly
impossible not to flinch.The same praise goes to the incredible acting performances. Though that
is to be expected with a cast like this one. DiCaprio does an
incredible job, which we are used from him, though sometimes he goes so
far that his acting borders on a theatrical performance. Then again,
that is not necessarily a bad thing, especially not in a story like
that of "The Revenant". It is however Tom Hardy who, in my opinion,
steals the show here. While he has played some great bad guys in the
past, this role might be my favourite of his. He manages to keep your
attention at all times as he delivers his hard and cold-blooded
dialogue with impeccable timing. A truly riveting performance, so
interesting to watch Hardy immediately sucks up all the attention when
he's on screen. Looking to the other cast members I can say that
Domhnall Gleeson continues to do a great job as we have seen so often
the past year (seriously, it feels as if he has been in every good film
these last years) and Will Poulter honestly surprised me, though I have
not seen enough of him yet to justify my surprise. To summarise, if you are only looking for a great story, you might be
leaving the theatre a tad disappointed. However if you accept the
simplicity of the narrative and just enjoy the fantastic movie- making
that is masterfully displayed by Iñárritu and his crew, you might leave
your seat with a feeling of exhilaration, just like I did.

It never ceases to amaze me how very different people's views are
regarding the same subject. Some of the reviews here regard this film
as boring and a waste of nearly 3 hours. For me, I just looked on in
awe from the first minute to last. Yes it is long with slow parts
between the excitement, yet this for me adds to the overall structure
of the film. The despair and anguish displayed during these periods
were almost palpable, oozing from the screen, due to the superb job of
cinematography employed.This review will not touch on the plot as it has been more than played
out in these reviews. For me, although the plot was obvious by the
title, what set it into orbit was the marriage of brilliant acting set
within the harsh wilderness in which it was filmed.In my opinion this film will go down as a modern day classic. For
generations to come it will be looked back on with admiration for the
superb acting and sheer enormity of its production with great special
effects. They will also look back and believe it was a worthy first
Oscar for an actor named Leonardo DiCaprio.

And I do not say that lightly.This film was a triumph of the art and craft that is filmmaking. Its
epic landscapes, wondrously and heartbreakingly captured by Lubezki,
are the first thing that makes this film stand out. The environment in
which Glass' story takes place is brought to life in a way which few
films are able to achieve. You feel Glass' sense of familiarity and awe
with what he is surrounded by. An untamed land filled with fauna and
flora of various description. That the film is able to bristle with
life and natural resonance in such a way is the main aspect which sets
this experience apart and places it among the pantheon of superlative
cinema.The story, deceptively simple, is actually a story which reaches back
to the epic storytelling traditions of timeless Homerian and
Shakespearian classics. Glass is on his own personal odyssey of
revenge. Like King Lear, he is cast amongst the wilderness, it is up to
him to survive. He is also challenged to keep hold of his humanity
amidst the loss he has suffered at the hands of cruel, barbaric
self-interest. Hardy is the Iago of the piece, a man consumed with
malignant malevolence, seemingly compelled to cause misery and
suffering to those around him, no doubt a mirroring of his own tortured
soul. The film has brief, precious moments of gallantry, generosity and
understanding, but they occur among a sea of brutality, both human and
otherwise. The film's protagonist, like Josey Wales and Ethan Edwards,
is cast into a twilight existence, a purgatory of sorts between life
and death. He must find an inspiration which reaches deeper than his
hate in order to find salvation. In this way Glass' journey mirrors our own. In order to find value in
our lives we must be driven by what we wish to become, not what we wish
to destroy. This story gives us this journey and this challenge and it
does so in the richest, most effective manner I have experienced in a
long time. It strips away our apparent civilisation and takes us back
fundamentally to our most primal routes.Iñárritu serves up a treat here; a spectacle with heart and life. His
direction is focused and fearless. He shows us the essence of who we
are without the need for distortion or equivocation. His story is so
firmly allied to what it is to be human that in its purity it ascends
to the highest peaks of cinematic achievement.

Oscar Nominee , Leonardo DiCaprio comes "The Revenant", inspired by
true events and based in part on the novel of the same name by Michael
Punke.The film starts off with a group of men in the 1820s, searching for
pelts (animal skins) in the 1820s. However, a member of the group, Hugh
Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), is brutally attacked by a grizzly bear,
doing great damage to his legs and torso. Following this, the rest of
the group struggle to carry him on a stretcher, especially when
approaching high, rocky ground. The leader of the group, Captain Andrew
Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) gives orders to three members of the group,
Bridger (Will Poulter), John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) & Glass' son to
stay behind and watch over Glass. Fitzgerald soon gets tired of this,
kills the son and buries Glass alive, leaving him for dead. Days later,
Glass awakens and must get back to their camp, enduring the inability
to walk, freezing cold temperatures, and of course the long journey
home. But he is driven by revenge for what Fitzgerald did to him. This is probably one of the most intense movies I have ever seen.
Watching the screen with my undivided attention, I could hardly believe
some of the things happening on screen. The opening battle scene was in
my opinion epic, you could really believe that all those men really
were being killed in the most brutal ways possible. The bear scene will
be something not forgotten for many years to come, with flawless visual
effects, making the entire scene very realistic, with small but
effective touches put in here and there to make it that bit more
credible. For example, when the bear breathes out while close to the
camera, you can see the camera being fogged up momentarily: small but
effective.If Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar this year, then he never
will. This is one of the greatest performances by an actor I have seen
in quite some time. He really sells the fact that his character is
constantly in pain, and for also climbing inside the carcass of a real
horse, just for a movie. If that's not dedication, then I don't know
what is.It's not just DiCaprio that deserves praise, though. Tom Hardy puts in
another intimidating, evocative and breathtaking performance as John
Fitzgerald. I really felt a strong sense of hatred towards this selfish
character near the end of the film and greatly anticipated the
excellent climax to the film.Finally, I must give credit to the director, Alejandro G. Inarritu.
After winning 3 Oscars, most directors would sit back and take it easy
for a few years, but Inarritu has brought us a film with breathtaking
visuals and a great story that will be adored by film- viewers for
generations to come.The Revenant is nothing less than a true masterpiece. This is
definitely the best film I've seen in 2015 and I'd strongly advise
anyone to go out and see this movie while it's still in cinemas.Rating: 5/5

Our group was split about which movie to see so half of us saw the
Revenant and the other half saw the Hateful 8 (which I'd already seen
twice)... man was I glad I saw the Revenant instead. The cinematography
is just stunning, the CGI is most realistic (although you know it must
be CGI because they can't train animals to do that stuff) and the
story-line is compelling beyond belief.Because of all the running water in the movie I wanted to go pee after
the first hour but each time a few minutes would pass another amazing
event would happen which kept me glued to my seat as I didn't want to
miss a single thing; see this movie if you love great film-making.

I was very worried about how this movie was going too turn out to be
honest! I never even wanted to see this movie at first but my friends
had dragged me to the movie theater. The movie started off very action
packed and had a lot of sad moments in the beginning and Leonardo had
portrayed his character so well. Tom Hardy is known as the "villain" in
the movie, and i never even noticed him at first because all of the
dirt covering his face, his long beard, and messed up teeth. I really
hope they both get Oscars for their performances because it was truly
one of those movies that you have to go see in the movie theater. The
picture and scenery was truly beautiful and Leonardo was on his own
through out most of the movie and the stuff that he had to do too
survive was truly mesmerizing and disturbing at the same time. I
applaud everyone in this movie because it was truly a great movie!

I watched it 4 times guys...who else did that? I am an extreme critique
of movies..I watch movies more than one time in theatres, only once in
every 5-10 years...This once deserves to be watched 4 times for sure...I am tired of a lifestyle of superficiality and this movie has nothing
but real life , real content, and depth..Its also like watching
national geographic snow expeditions (that I loved watching as a kid) ,
on a epic movie scale..As much as movies are meant for entertainment..there is hardly anything
here (tv, media etc) that actually helps people live in any reality...This is reality guys ...We have to start thinking of important deeper
things in life and not live uneducated and be shocked by life when we
are living in superficiality... This movie gets you back on track on
many levels..

I was already a huge fan of both DiCaprio and Hardy's work and The
Revenant is just another stellar film to be added to their collection.
Right from the get go you are immersed into their world and it totally
consumes you. Not only with their incredible performances but also with
the entire supporting cast. More importantly, the landscapes are just
mesmerizing. Every single scene is artistic and beautifully captured,
just adding to the wonderful story that is being told. Considering the
length of the film, Inarritu has done a brilliant job of ensuring that
you are never bored and constantly entertained. The action is gritty
and tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is a dark
realism to this film as well, ranging from the harsh environment they
are living in, to the mercurial characters that inhabit it. This is
easily going to be one of the biggest hits of the year and it's only
just started. I highly recommend people go and see this.

Sometimes I wonder if it's just me; at other times I'm convinced that
critical snobbery really is alive and well. For many critics a director
can do anything but be successful. The latest case in point is
Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who may be raking in the Oscars but is now
fashionable to slag off and for that very reason. Nothing like back to
back gold statuettes to attract those critical brickbats, Last year
Inarritu won both the Best Director and Best Picture Oscars for
"Birdman", not to mention the screenplay prize. In a year that also saw
"Boyhood" I felt this was a bit excessive but while "Birdman" may not
have been the year's Best PIcture it was infinitely better than many
critics suggested; bold, innovative and one of the great movies about
the theatre. Now we have "The Revenant", a two-and-a-half hour
wilderness epic about survival that has just received 12 Oscar
nominations and would appear very much the one to beat when it comes to
handing out the awards. It's also become very fashionable, in some
critical quarters, to pan it and to pan Inarritu, not just for having
the audacity in making it in the first place, but suddenly for his
entire body of work, as if success at the Oscars was beneath a real
artist.Okay, I don't think it's a masterpiece but it's also bold, innovative
and the work of a visionary director who isn't afraid to take chances
even if they don't always pay off. Basically it's the story of one man,
Hugh Glass, (a terrific Leonardo Di Caprio), left for dead by his
fellow trappers in the wilderness, (the title comes from the French for
ghost or perhaps more appropriately someone returning from the dead),
as he makes his way back to what passes for civilization to extract his
revenge.It's a long and grueling picture, never more so than for Di Caprio who
is really put through the mill here and while there are several scenes
of action and excitement there are equally long stretches when
absolutely nothing happens. Perhaps, with a bit of judicious pruning,
Inarritu could have made a tighter film, (there is only so much of Di
Caprio wandering through the snowy wastes we can take), but I am also
out on whether shrinking the film would have improved it. What we have
is very much Inarritu's vision, warts and all, and in an age when
commercial film-makers tend to play safe, it's great to see someone
break the rules.Visually it's extraordinary, (once again the stunning cinematography is
in the safe hands of Emmanuel Lubezki), and as well as Di Caprio there
is equally fine work from Domhnall Gleeson as the captain who tries to
save him and Tom Hardy, (stealing every scene he's in), as the
villainous Fitzgerald. Last year I felt "Birdman's" Oscar glory was
undeserved; this year I will have no such reservations when "The
Revenant" sweeps the board.

"If Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't get an Oscar for this, I swear" my
cousin said next to me as the credits came up on the screen. I nodded
in agreement, mouth slack in utter awe. My mind avalanched with every
scene, every word, every sound. I saw this movie in IMAX at the AMC
theater and I do not regret the extra money spent. The Revenant is a movie based on true events in the 1820s about a group
of fur traders journeying through the midwest. Among those traders is
Hugh Glass played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Glass is the revenant, the one
who comes back from the dead after being brutally attacked by a Grizzly
and left to his own devices.First and foremost, the movie soundtrack. From start to finish music
supervisors, Ryuichi Sakomoto and Alva Noto curate this intense
ethereal sound that tells the story by itself. "The Revenant Main
Theme" song howls with wind and weeps with sweeping violin strokes. I
wasn't just watching the movie, I was feeling it, too.Kudos to Alejandro G. Inarritu for once again accomplishing a dramatic
masterpiece the likes of Babel (2006), but even more fervent. Since the
movie What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), with Leonardo DiCaprio,
Innaritu said in an interview with Hollywood Reporter that "there's
something in Leo that I haven't seen in a long time." He said to Leo,
"I would love to see you fragile, vulnerable--to see the man that can
be broken." The star of the show never disappoints. DiCaprio spoke Pawnee
effortlessly and a dead man's suffering even better. Supporting actor
Tom Hardy played an equally exemplary role as Glass' foe, John
Fitzgerald. He completely transforms for this character with a
complimentary head scar and fowl mouth. While empathizing and marveling
in Glass' trek, I was aghast and disgusted with Fitzgerald's. They were
both extremely well-done and Oscar-deserving actors.Yet another Oscar-worthy player in the game is undoubtedly the
cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki known for Gravity (2013). The scenic
stills of the bitter Canadian landscape juxtaposed with the harsh
vulnerability of the character. Not only that, but the angles made me
feel as if I were truly there, right next to DiCaprio. This movie has changed my perspective on life's struggles. It gave me a
deeper appreciation for what I had and an enlightening message about
being human: being human is about wanting to survive. When you achieve
that, nothing is more fulfilling. If you want to see a movie that will
change your life, then watch The Revenant.

I think this movie can be classed in two categories - "movies for the
big screen" and "movies for men". The last category is tongue-in-cheek
because I know there is a 'movies for men' channel that usually shows
really bad films. I watched this at the cinema with a group of friends.
The women did not like it as much as men did - that is all I am saying,
but all agreed that the cinematography was amazing.It is a story of survival in the wilderness in 19th century America. I
think fur trapping was a lucrative business at the time and these guys
were out there doing their job when catastrophe falls on them. Leonardo
DiCaprio (Glass) and Tom Hardy (Fitzgerald) are the two main actors in
this film, and they do a good job. One of the main themes of the film
is revenge and these two actors play well against each other. The other
theme is survival and this picture is relentless in the displaying
hardship endured in what appears to be a endless winter wonderland. The
film is shot completely in winter which is great if you like epic
landscapes and there is plenty to admire in the beautifully shot
locations.There is also a running theme through the film of Indian tribes and
their relationship with the 'white people', who were pushing them off
their land. Glass and Fitzgerald I felt represented different views of
the settlers on the Indians. One was of including their culture, the
other was excluding it. I thought it was quite interesting with the
racism agenda at the current Oscars that this film, which could win the
best film, does convey a subtle anti-racist message.Two and half hours, but not boring at all. A must watch in a cinema
though. The visual display is enough in itself to make it a good watch
- 8/10.

I just watched this film yesterday and I believe that The Revenant is a
true cinematic masterpiece. Alejandro Inrarritu and Emmanuel Lubezki
have really outdone themselves and clearly illustrate what cinema is
all about. The entire cast have brought their A-game and really have made it
completely believable. Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy are not even
noticeable in their roles which goes to show how dedicated and artistic
they are in wanting to show their great acting craft which I believe is
probably one of their best performances to date.Amazing Cinematography which gives finally a break well needed from the
rubbish that keeps pouring into the cinemas with the same camera shots
and boring story structures, THIS FILM DOES JUSTICE for a change!Outstanding performances and directing, without all that it would be a
very simple boring film of revenge seen a million times.I do believe however the film could have been much shortened down,
simply because of irrelevant uses of showing landscapes and shots that
don't set up or provide the visual literature needed to make the story
flow but rather just feel like they've been dumped into the timeline to
watch to kill some time. Although every shot is amazing in visuals,
there's a lot that's unnecessary.Guess the production wanted to show in the edit room what its like to
be in those conditions and feel the characters emotions as the crew
really went in those environments so I guess it was a way for them to
watch it back and be proud- fair enough...Bear attack is probably going to stay as an iconic scene in cinema
history. No crappy cuts to the bear to make it feel scary, just a
realistic attack that is horrifying but captivating and amazing.I give this film a 9/10 because it gives you an cinema experience which
as a film maker myself I believe in, its not a conventional film set to
get only for the bank roll.If you are up for an experience and something different- WATCH IT!

The revenant is by far one of the most beautiful films ever. Is poetic,
grand, epic, mesmerizing, is a film that is in a completely new level.
Inarritu did it again.One of the reasons i love inarritu films so much, is because they all
are super original, have such a unique style and are always
groundbreaking.. And the revenant is another showcase of this. The
story while being about revenge, is unlike everything i've ever seen.
Is so fresh, so unique, its like you are experiencing a poem coming to
life. Is really well paced, and its highly climatic. You just want to
see what happens next and how will it end keeping you at the edge of
your seat. Is a highly immersive experience, where you feel you are right there
with the characters. Part of the reason for this, is because the film
is insanely realistic. it's like a documentary. You feel everything the
characters feel just by watching. Its like they just traveled back in
time and recorded everything. The attention to detail is astonishing.
It can be very brutal, but its part of the why the film is so great.
The most impressive scene, by far, is the bear scene, where you will
refuse to admit that bear isn't real.The cast is just beyond perfect, and for actors clearly stand out:
Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Tom hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio. But of
course, Dicaprio and Hardy are the ones that steal the show. And in the
end, the tour-de-force comes from Dicaprio. The fact that he did
everything you see, for real, like the true character did, just says it
all. His character doesn't have much dialogue, and this is his most
physical performance yet, it's not my favorite, but its his most
impressive one. With just a look, a move, an expression, he says
everything. And the long due Oscar cant go to anyone but him.The film is just so beautiful is insane. There's a lot of breathtaking
nature vistas, so beautifully shot that nature feels like a main
character in the film, and it is. The cinematography is mesmerizing,
the fact that the film was shot with natural light just makes this one
of the most breathtaking visual experiences ever, and again, the Oscar
cant go to anyone else but lubezky. The same goes for everyone else in
the crew. The production values in this film are through the roof, so
real that is like they don't exist. The make up is amazing. The score
is brilliant, because it makes such an eerie atmosphere that is a huge
part in the films identity. The camera moves are incredible, and the
visual effects, well, what visual effects? i can't distinguish whats
real or what's VFX. A case of both style and substance, this breathtaking journey of man vs
nature, vs man, is really immersive, emotional, thrilling, awe
inspiring, i could just go on and on. Its a film that you either love
or not, but you will always appreciate it for the unbelievable
achievements of its production and the incredible performances.

A film that can make you feel extreme cold down to the core and that
hurls you into a journey that is truly incredible. Going into this you would expect nothing but pure beauty and vision
from the directing of Alejandro Inarritu and this does not disappoint,
with incredible long takes and impossible angles he has cemented his
place as one of the great directors. Alongside this is once again the
faultless Leonardo DiCaprio, with acting portrayed purely by emotions
and minimal dialogue that captures the pain and struggle of Hugh Glass
on a journey of survival, love and revenge. Tom hardy has proved
himself to be one of the most sort after actors today, and you can see
why. This may not be his best role but is one that is perfectly
portrayed.Finally this may be the year DiCaprio wins the Oscar for best actor and
I can see why, he has already proved himself with countless great
performances over the years so it will be about time, but ultimately
the star of this film is the Director. From behind the camera Alejandro
Inarritu has created a film that may be the most beautiful and powerful
in the last decade.

The Revenant is one of those movies that get made once in many
years.The movie provides a breath taking experience both in terms of
cinematic representation of nature's beauty and it's ugliness.The movie
revolves around the life of fur trapper Hugh Glass and his ordeal to
take revenge. The details provided by director Alejandro Iñárritu is
simply genius, at some point viewers are compelled to step back and
think how is this possible to shoot. Cinematography is perfect.
Leonardo DiCaprio has given the best performance of his life, he was
able to successfully portray the pain and suffering of Hugh Glass. In
simple words if The Revenant doesn't fetch Leo his Oscar then nothing
can. Tom Hardy also gave an amazing performance he is in race for an
Oscar as well. A word of caution though this movie is not for the
faint-hearted. It is brutal and gut-wrenching so buck up and have a
good LONG time watching The Revenant. * watch out for the bear scene*

Unless you've been in a cave, you know this is the story of a
frontiersman mauled by a bear and left by his comrades to die. It is a
classic man against nature survival story. Add in bad guy French
trappers, mostly hostile Native Americans and greedy deceitful
individuals that round out the characters.The real star is the environment. It is beautifully photographed.
Plenty of ice, snow, running water and wind in the trees. The fact that
this movie was made in obvious treacherous locations is just amazing.Leonardo DiCaprio had best clear space on his mantel for all the awards
he will pick up for this performance. In a time of dialogue driven
movies, he is too cold, too alone and too hurt to say much. His
performance is all over his frosted face. Tom Hardy is a bit of a one
note bad guy. Will Poulter, best in "We're the Millers" was
distractingly miscast.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu deserves the credit for getting this made
and making it in what seemed like unworkable conditions. Unfortunately
the hand of the director is felt more then once in distracting
flashbacks and the now signature Inarritu levitation of characters. The movie is too long, yet some things seemed rushed. Why did the
Pawnee Indian leave DiCaprio except for a dramatic highly staged later
scene? Why didn't the Captain take more men to track and capture
Fitzgerald? The writer and director and the audience knew it would come
down to a DiCaprio, Hardy fight at the end. The unsubtle tattoo on the
girl and the marking on the canteen are fodder for future satire. See this in a theater on the biggest screen available. There is a turn
your stomach level of violence and gore. It may not be a good time at
the movies, but it is remarkable movie making.

Watching "Birdman" for the third time, I viewed it just to appreciate
the cinematography. On first viewing I only wanted to immerse myself in
what was promised to be a groundbreaking and highly enjoyable trip to
the theater; it was, in no small measure. When you spend the entirety
of the film looking for a "cut," you aren't absorbing, you are
monitoring. Knowing that Inarritu was using the great cinematographer
Emmanuel Lubeszki again for "The Revenant," it was a chore not to
measure cut lengths, camera movement, and blocking. This was not a
distraction, just an affirmation that I would need to see this film
again, and again simply for appreciation.This story doesn't build to a finale so much as sustain a continued
agony that is bearable to the viewer through character perseverance and
beautiful filmmaker craft. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't demand pity for
his situation, he doesn't relent in his drive long enough to evoke
sympathetic emotions. From the first mechanically shot battle sequence,
we are spectators to this man, and we don't want to leave him. The
world that Glass resides in is beyond hostile, and there is very little
reason why we should want him to survive so badly, but that feeling is
sustained throughout. Revenge becomes a murky motivation until it needs
a boost. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald gives us plenty of reason to see
Glass through to the end and exact it.Fitzgerald is the soulless volunteer who callously leaves Hugh for dead
and sees the world as carrying a debt that is owed to him. The pacing
of Glass's survival juxtaposed to Fitzgerald's damnable existence back
at base, fuel the audiences involvement in exquisite balance. Anytime
you wonder "What is Glass even fighting for anymore?" Hardy steals a
scene that demands retribution. Aside from Fitzgerald and the terrain,
the local Native American Pawnee tribe are a continued threat, always
fast on Glass's heals. As overwhelming as this may seem, there is never
a moment where it doesn't feel authentic.Due to the sustained tension throughout this movie, the climax doesn't
pack the punch we are accustomed to. There is an unnecessary use of
Dues Ex Machina in the final moments that doesn't hurt the plot, but
makes it feel needlessly formulaic. Long-takes blended in with seamless
choreography of action make this a prime candidate for Best Picture and
Cinematography. Leo's performance is second to none this year. And it
should be noted that if Inarritu pulls off an Oscar for directing, it
will be the third consecutive Mexican won award, his second in a row.
This is a great year for film, and whatever the cast and crew of The
Revenant walk away with in February, I begrudge them nothing.

A revenant is a person who comes back...and that is exactly what the
director is..a person who has come back and equaled...almost..the
brilliance of Birdman..This is the movie that Tarantino would love to be able to make.For starter you will never ever see a more well directed movie..the
camera work is again stunning..taking in the far away beauty of nature
right up to the close up of mans grief.The bear scene was like no other I have seen..and the violence..very
short..but very violent ..was added as a matter of fact..not slowly
added to increase tension..it was there then gone..as violence is..from
nowhere then gone.De Caprio will of course win an Oscar and so will direction..maybe
camera work and costume also..if not..there is a problem.Masterfully crafted into an experience more than a movie and with
exactly the right amount of dialogue..this treasure will,like
Birdman,push other directors to better themselves and that is good for
the movies.Only down for me was Tom Hardy..who , while OK..has not got enough
experience to carry a role yet ..he is always himself and needs a few
more years to hone his roles.Gave it a 9 ..gave Birdman a 10 as i feel the lack of script between
actors here was not as good as the latter.Amazing experience at the theatre....

Oh. My. God. The Revenant was absolutely amazing! Di Caprio in one of
his best performances, especially considering the incredible physical
and mental (he actually did eat a real buffalo liver) exertion he had
to put in this act. Tom Hardy, if possible, even better than Leo
himself. Rising like a phoenix this actor is growing brilliantly,
better and better every film. He deserves the Oscar not only for his
incredible talent shown in this film but for the amazing development
he's had in the last years. Iñárritu seriously overtook himself. The
directing of this film is unbelievable. Starting with the scene of the
battle at the beginning, one long incredible take of pure magic to the
very end of it. His writing is great as well. Even if based in part on
a novel, his touch is strongly present in the screenplay. The
cinematography was the best part of all. Lubezki did an incredible
work. The photography was seriously insane. And if you consider that
all the film is entirely shot using natural light only (boom  mind
blown!). I won't be surprised if he wins the 3rd Oscar in a row. This
film deserves, at least, 4 of the most important Oscars.

This movie is probably the best movie of 2015 (objectively the best,
Mad Mad Max is my favorite on an entertainment level). The seamless
directing and cinematography are what make this movie work, any other
director might have turned this into a basic man vs. nature feature,
but it was put into the best hands Hollywood could've picked the amount
of preparation and skill that it must have taken to make this movie
blows my mind. If Leonardo DiCaprio, Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and Emmanuel Lubezki don't
win their respective Oscars for this I will lose all faith in humanity.I literally had to lower the ratings on other films that I now see are
overrated in comparison, just to compensate for this movie's level of
mastery in cinematography and acting.

One is difficult to answer how something so implausible, so absolutely
fantastical can touch you more than your miserable, though definitely
real, life. Yes, It is implausible, beginning with the unbelievably
dedicated and self-sacrificing Captain and totally unassailable Glass.
In this company Fitzgerald with his quite natural for human beings itch
for gaining money and not being violently murdered by vicious Indians
looks like the world evil and villain number one at the same time. Even
given his sad story, told more than graphically to his young fellow.I couldn't help but admire at those two grand actors picturing heroes
rather atypical for modern cinema. One is trying to save his life not
in a very picturesque way and losing all his appeal for female viewers.
The other, having not more than a page of text, is stretching out all
his actor abilities in order to grab the Award people desire for him
more than he could possibly imagine. If you ask me though, I would give the coveted Award to American
landscape which is impossible to take eyes off. My language is too poor
to describe horizon-less heaths, deep wild forests and steeply rocks
above the fast and furious river. Or give it to the actor who played
Grizzle, I almost died three times during this incredible (again)
fight. Here is the case when it's better to see once than to read this
for no matter how many times. The last thing I want to add to my incomprehensible review is the
sadness I always feel when it comes to American Indians pictured by
Americans, doesn't matter if it's Pocahontas or The Last of The
Mohicans. Tragedy of the great people, with which the world lost the
last drop of wisdom and understanding of the nature it can never
revive.

A haunting, complex, uncompromising piece of film of which its biggest
success is how much it opens for a conversation about filmaking and the
power of movies. It is really challenging in craft and provides for a
very, very singular experience, despite some overbearing and slightly
pretentious touches. There is one thing that really struck me in thinking about the film: it
could be really easy to hate on it for its flaws, because there are
flaws and they are the reason this film isn't getting the universal
acclaim people were expecting. The flaws it has are actually quite
relevant: the screenplay isn't really anything special, there is so
much acting thrown to your face in an way too overwhelming way. It is
one of those films that really pushes the "look at us we're acting"
thing and almost everybody is part of it. There also lots of breathing
space that isn't really necessary and overall the whole thing really is
thrown into your face in an overwhelming way that sometimes totally
forgets subtlety and brings down also the film thematically. But the
point is, all of these flaws are there and they would normally really
knock a movie down, yet there is so much triumph here in the craft of
filmaking, so much ambition, so much sheer cinema, it is really hard to
get mad at anything of this. Basically the positives outweigh the
negatives. As much as I said that there's the "look at us we're actors" thing, of
whom Inarritu is also to blame for, there is even more genuine
fantastic work from them. Could DiCaprio have done with being a little
more subtle in points? of course, but you simply can't discount a
performance of this caliber based on that. He has problems in
disappearing from the screen a an actor, but overall what he does here
is some kind of remarkable. With his recent movies he is almost
creating a new school of acting that isn't quite anything we've seen
before, good or bad I don't know. Domnall Glesson and Will Poulter also
have their chance to shine. Still, nobody manages to take over the
Brando of our generation: Tom Hardy can do no wrong, he upstages all of
the actors and steals every moment he is in, he is just a powerhouse.A thought that really, really hit me after this film and that I cannot
stop thinking about is how much I would now love to see Inarritu direct
an action film. Just writing that makes me even more excited about it.
He just has a thing were under his direction the technical aspect of a
film is beyond debatable. It is just flawless. The sound, music,
Lubezki's photography, everything, it just leaves your jaw dropped. He
does take a little too much breathing time as I said before, but it is
easily forgettable when you see what he can do when sh*t hits the fan.
I repeat it, I just want to see him direct two hours of action now,
that's how visceral this film is, it is astonishing. He reminds you
what is the power of cinema and actually goes further in that in
creating new ways to use the screen. There is a horse chase in this
film where I couldn't believe what was happening with the camera and
the shock value it has floored me.As I said, if you really want to hate this film there is nothing
stopping you, but as a fan of cinema and filmaking and as an obsessed
lover of the craft behind everything involving film, "The Revenant" was
really an achievement.

First, before I begin this review I would like to say that I will talk
in depth about many aspects of the movie and plot, and how they are
good, but I will not tell you what happens in the plot of the movie
EXCEPT who the main antagonist is. So if you are not up for that then I
suggest clicking off, but I have still out a spoiler warning just to be
on the safe side. Now this movie has to be one of the best movies I have seen up to date
so far. The reason why is because I believe that they did everything
near perfect. First, let us talk about performances because they are
one of the things that make this movie great. The performances in this
movie were phenomenal, but in particular, Leonardo's performance had to
be one of the best that I have seen up to date. Why is this performance
so good? The reason why is because throughout watching this film I
found that playing this role looked like it must have been one of the
hardest roles to play in movie history, and Leonardo did it perfectly.
Not only did he perform the scenes well, but he also did an amazing job
portraying all the characters mental and physical struggles that he
will have to endure as he goes through his journey, which made
Leonardo's performance even more beautiful to watch. I would also like
to mention Tom Hardy's performance as well. I found that he gave a good
performance. He did a good job not only as a supporting character, but
also as an antagonist, which was important for the movie as a hole. Next, I would like to talk about scenery and the action sequences.
First off, the scenery in this film looked so incredibly beautiful.
What made it beautiful was not only the amazing shots of the sky,
mountains, and snow, but also the fact that there was almost no CGI
whatsoever. These both made the scenery look a lot more crisp and
amazing. Now the action sequences, I honestly think that the action
sequences were well done. They were quick paced, and combined with the
score (which I will talk about later) were also thrilling and made the
scenes come to life across the screen. Last but not least the Cinematography and score. The cinematography in
this movie was just extremely good. They did an excellent job on it and
it really helped escalate the intensity of the movie, which prevented
it from being boring and dry. The score also goes hand and hand with
the cinematography and overall the movie itself. It perfectly fit in
all the right places and made scenes even more thrilling and dramatic
as well. Now before I end this review I did not talk about the plot much not
only to prevent spoilers but also because it is based on a true story
so I decided to not focus on that. I would also like to say that
Alejandro González Iñárritu is an amazing director that deserves his
accomplishments and success. Overall, I would give this a 9.5 because no movie is perfect and I
might have missed something on the way. Thank you for reading and I
hope you have a wonderful day.

You cannot deny this film's beautiful cinematography and excellent
direction. You also can't deny there are a few excellent performances
with Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio standing out. However, for me it
doesn't quite deliver as much as I expected it too. This could be due
to me having high expectations for this movie, as there has been a lot
of hype surrounding it, not to mention the 12 Oscar nominations.
Although, I found the overall experience enjoyable I couldn't help but
think that it could have been better. The film never seemed to deliver
what it promised after the brutal and enthralling Native American
attack at the start of the film. Some of the following hour and a half
is at times a little boring. This scene was a highlight along with the
bear attack, the murder of Glass' son and the finale. This is not to
say that the rest of the film is all boring and unnecessary but some of
it I feel is. I get it, we're watching this mans brutal struggle to
survive in this vast wilderness against all the odds. We're watching
him suffer from injuries and fight to survive at every turn, all in the
name of revenge. But there is a period where we see Leonardo do little
more than grunt and grimace which I understand is what the character
would be doing, it just grows a little tiresome after a while. If it
weren't for the picturesque setting and beautiful shots captured there
are times when you could nod off. For me, despite a tremendous
performance from Leonardo (you really do believe he's going through
hell mentally and physically) I'm unsure it's Oscar worthy. So many of
his previous roles certainly have been, but for him to pick it up for
this I think is unlikely. I can't think of many actors who've won the
best actor in a leading role award whilst having about 20 lines over
2.5 hours. Tom Hardy on the other hand is one I could see picking up an
award and deservingly so as he puts in a sensationally convincing
performance from start to finish. To conclude this film is worth a
watch and at times extremely gripping whilst at other times it seems to
drift of course and lose you throughout its long running time. If it
weren't for some excellent individual performances, beautiful
cinematography and outstanding direction I would have given this film a
much lower score, as the story and character development are a little
off par. Can't help but think it had the potential to be a masterpiece.
8/10 stars

Webster's Dictionary defines the word 'revenant' as "one that returns
after death or a long absence." This word summarizes accurately the
adversity that Oscar-nominated actor Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass
confronts in "Birdman" director Alejandro González Iñárritu's "The
Revenant," an unforgettable frontier yarn set in early 1820's America.
Struggling against virtually insuperable odds to stay alive after a
mama bear mauls him, Hugh Glass watches in horror when his own comrades
abandon him for dead. Glass' mind-boggling battle for survival occurred
during an ill-fated trapping expedition in what is now South Dakota.
Grizzly not only describes the formidable female bear that attacks
Glass, but also the obstacles that Glass must conquer during his
desperate fight to get back to civilization and wreak vengeance.
Although this gorgeously-lensed movie is based in part on Michael
Punke's 2002 novel, the real Hugh Glass was a celebrated contemporary
of fellow mountain men Jedediah Smith and Grizzly Adams. Glass led an
adventurous life as a smuggler, ship's captain, pirate, frontiersman,
trapper, fur trader, hunter, and explorer. Oscar-nominated Mexican
director Iñárritu dwells on this chapter of Glass' extraordinary life,
and he surrounds DiCaprio with a brawny supporting cast. You've never
seen "The Wolf of Wall Street" like you see him in "The Revenant," and
the closest DiCaprio movie to feature such a dreadful predicament is
the historical French costume drama "The Man in the Iron Mask." Tom
Hardy, who played both Max in "Mad Max Fury Road" and Bane in "The Dark
Knight Rises," makes a despicable villain that you will abhor with a
passion. The majestic scenery that serves as a backdrop for this epic
journey makes the hero and the villain seem larger-than-life as they
negotiate a landscape rife with peril. Iñárritu spent nine months
shooting "The Revenant" in chronological order at a variety of scenic
locations in British Columbia, Montana, San Francisco, and finally
Argentina. Oscar-nominated cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and he shot
this masterpiece using only natural light to heighten the authenticity.As "The Revenant" unfolds, Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson of
"Ex Machina") of the Rocky Mountain Trading Company has hired Hugh
Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio of "Inception") to serve as a scout for a fur
trapping expedition. Things take a turn for the worse early on as
savage Arikara Indians attack their camp. Many of the trappers die in
the fracas, and Glass suggests that they return to their Fort Kiowa
headquarters by an overland route. John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy of
"Lawless"), a thoroughly obnoxious trapper from Texas, hates the idea,
but he goes along reluctantly with it. Meantime, while he is out
foraging for food, Glass spots two bawling bear cubs and then sees
their aggressive mother. This pugnacious bear launches herself at Glass
and turns him every which way but loose. Mind you, Glass manages to
squeeze off one shot from his single-shot rifle before the bear tears
into him and devastates our hero with her six-inch razor-sharp claws.
Eventually, the wounded bear succumbs to Glass' bullet, and our hero
finishes the beast off with a huge knife. Captain Henry orders his men
build a stretcher for Glass, but the expedition halts when the terrain
prevents them from carrying Glass any farther. Moreover, the woebegone
Glass appears in such ghastly condition that Henry feels certain he
will die. He promises extra pay to anybody who will stick around until
Glass dies and give him a Christian burial. Fitzgerald and Jim Bridger
(Will Poulter of "The Maze Runner") both volunteer to stay with Glass
until the inevitable. Naturally, Glass' Pawnee Indian son Hawk
(newcomer Forrest Goodluck) refuses to desert his dad. Eventually,
Fitzgerald grows impatient with Glass when he doesn't die. Not only
does he kill Hawk, but also he tries to bury Glass alive. Fearing for
his own life, Bridger accommodates Fitzgerald's disloyalty.
Miraculously, Glass survives and embarks upon an incredible journey to
reach civilization and pay back Fitzgerald for his treachery. For the record, "The Revenant" is the third movie about Glass's
astonishing exploits. The first movie was "Vanishing Point" director
Richard C. Sarafian's "Man in the Wilderness" (1971) with Irish actor
Richard Harris as the resilient hunter who lived through a bear attack,
but his fellow trappers left him behind to die in isolation. While the
character that Harris portrayed in "Man in the Wilderness" was called
Zachary Bass, the Bass character was based largely on Hugh Glass and
his legendary exploits. "Man in the Wilderness" ranks as an
above-average adventure narrative, but it isn't half as good as
Iñárritu's "The Revenant." Far more abysmal is the hopelessly inferior
"Apache Blood" (1975), the second cinematic account of Glass's grizzly
encounter. Vern Piehl spread himself too thin as producer, director,
and cinematographer on this mediocre reenactment. In Piehl's
saddle-sore cavalry versus the Indians saga, a veteran army scout named
Sam Glass tangles with a bear and emerges the worse for wear. "Man in
the Wilderness" simulated the bear attack with an actual bear wrestling
with its trainer. In the amateurish "Apache Blood," the bear attacks
the scout as he is refilling his canteen. The actor gropes somebody in
a bear costume. The mauling in "The Revenant" looks far more realistic
despite the conspicuous CGI work involved behind the scenes to
replicate the savage event. Primarily, "Man in the Wilderness," "Apache
Blood," and "The Revenant" follow the same plot line. Our
indestructible protagonist suffers at the claws of a furious mama bear,
and everybody deems him dead for the long haul. Punke's novel as well
as all three films follow the plot up to that point. In all four
adaptations, Glass's companions betray him. Villainous Percy Herbert
betrayed Richard Harris in "Man in the Wilderness." Cowardly cavalry
troopers left Glass to fend for himself in "Apache Blood." Tom Hardy
displays no loyalty to DiCaprio in "The Revenant." Occasionally, the
action slows down because our protagonist wanders alone in desolation.
Nevertheless, "The Revenant" qualifies as a stunning film that deserves
all twelve of its Oscar nominations.

'The Revenant' is a film unlike anything that has come before it. Some
think it's overlong and pointless, others think it's one of the
greatest films of modern times. I fall into the latter. Regardless of
how audiences feel about this movie, I am sure that the majority of
cinema-goers will agree, it is a truly unique cinematic experience. It
is a film of such high quality on every level, that it's hard to pick
out who the star of the film is.Leonardo DiCaprio stars in his most committed performance yet. His
interpretation of Glass is a quiet, subdued performance, and the result
might be the greatest acting achievement of his career. DiCaprio
provides a layered performance of emotional complexity unseen from most
of Hollywood's highest-paid. 'The Revenant' proves that DiCaprio is one
of America's most dedicated, professional and passionate screen actors
working today. This is an actor who truly cares about the preservation
of cinema as art.Tom Hardy co-stars as John Fitzgerald, in an absolutely despicable
performance that never forgets it's humanity. His is definitely the
more showy of the two lead roles, and he delivers spectacularly, as an
intimidating man of psychological and emotional complexity in a
performance worthy of his first Oscar nomination. Domhnall Gleeson continues his reign as one of 2015's most prominent
and valuable actors. Will Poulter and Forrest Goodluck are both
stellar, and deserve to be called two of Hollywood's most promising
young actors. Each of these supporting roles work together as a
brilliantly realized ensemble, all playing off of one another to bring
out the most realistic performances. The acting in 'The Revenant' is
some of the best seen in 2015.Alejandro González Iñárritu has proved, once again, to be one of the
greatest and most important filmmakers of his generation. Delivering a
film of such ambition and cinematic scope, that it's impossible to not
be inspired by it's brilliance. Iñárritu has delivered an even more
ambitious project as his follow-up to 'Birdman'. This is a director who
strives to challenge himself as an artist, and I cannot praise that
fearless enthusiasm enough. There is a scene in 'The Revenant' that
echos a similar scene in 2014's 'Birdman'. Audiences will likely notice
a scene in which a meteor is seen falling through the sky. To me, this
is a symbol that applies to most of Iñárritu's work. It is a subtle yet
striking metaphor for self-destruction. In 'Birdman', Riggan's
self-centered view of life and desire to present eternal art is brings
him great emotional stress. In 'The Revenant', Glass' desire for
revenge is even more self-destructive, as he pushes himself to the
limits both physically, mentally and emotionally. It's this attention
to detail that makes Iñárritu's films important.The cinematography comes from two-time consecutive Oscar winner
Emmanuel Lubezki, who has previously created some of the most
breath-taking and unforgettable images seen in modern cinema, and this
film is no exception. In 'The Revenant', Lubezki has tackled one of the
most challenging works of cinematography ever seen in cinematic
history. Daring to shoot entirely in natural light, every shot on show
is savagely realistic, and a great piece of art in itself. Through many
long takes and tracking shots, Lubezki keeps the audience captivated
through both scenic shots and intense battle scenes. His work here is
sure to get him his third consecutive Oscar win and in my opinion, is
in serious contention for the greatest cinematography I have ever seen
on film.There's one scene in 'The Revenant' that everyone is talking about; the
bear scene. It is an absolutely terrifying, brutal scene that has a
primitive beauty to it. It's a scene of great intensity that explores
the nature between two powerful animals of great strength and
motivation to survive. CGI is used perfectly here, and to great effect.
It will go down as one of 2015's most memorable scenes, and deservedly
so. If I have one complaint towards 'The Revenant', it is that Glass
survives almost unbelievable physical strain. However the film does a
brilliant job of conveying time, and this is likely one reason that the
film feels so long, because it is an intentional artistic choice to
somewhat disrupt the film's pacing in a successful attempt to make the
audience feel the lengthiness of Glass' journey.A reoccurring complaint that 'The Revenant' has faced is that it is
"too long". It's run-time clocks in at 156-minutes, having it run only
10 minutes longer than either 'Avengers' installment. There is a simple
reason as to why this film feels so much longer than others of similar
length. It is because this is a film that dares to challenge it's
audience. This is not a fun movie. This isn't a date movie, or a
fun-night-out. This is a film made for the art of cinema. An art form
that has, throughout it's existence, been exploited as a means of
profit for production companies. 'Great cinema' has been a rare occurrence at the movies as of late, and
there are many reasons why. Without going into any of that in great
detail right now, I will say that 'The Revenant' is a film that strives
to achieve everything I admire about cinema, and it succeeds on almost
every level. 'The Revenant' has been frequently compared to Coppola's 'Apocalypse
Now', and with great reason. Both are incredible, visceral cinematic
experiences, both faced immeasurable production complications and both
are fine examples of cinema's potential. The potential that could be
met far more often if production companies took more risks on promising
films, films that strive for greatness, rather than ticket sales. All in all, 'The Revenant' is a violent film of realistic brutality. It
is most definitely a difficult, challenging time at the movies, but it
is also undoubtedly one of the most ambitious and immersive cinematic
experiences of the 21st Century.

The definition is "revenant" is: 1) a person who returns, 2) a person
who returns as a spirit after death; ghost, I was excited about this
film, months before its release, even more when it received award
nominations, from Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated
director Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores Perros, Babel, Biutiful,
Birdman). Based on a true story, set in 1823, in the unsettled
wilderness of the Louisiana Purchase, quasi-military hunting party of
trappers and hunters, commanded by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall
Gleeson), are hunting for pelts. The hunting party are ambushed by
hostile Native American Arikara Indians, only half of the party escape
on one of their rafts, they salvage as much as they can while still
under fire from the attacking Arikara, Henry knows they will still be
pursued. The party are further slowed down when experienced hunter Hugh
Glass (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Leonardo
DiCaprio) becomes separated from the others, he stumbles on a mother
grizzly bear and her cubs, the enraged grizzly savagely attacks him,
Glass eventually kills the bear, but he is left severely injured and
nearly dead himself. The hunting party can only provide rudimentary
medical care, they take wounded Glass with them, but he is on a
makeshift stretcher, slowing them down, finally one of the party, John
Fitzgerald (Oscar nominated Tom Hardy), suggests killing Glass.
Initially Henry tries to kill Glass himself, but is unable to do so,
instead he offers payment for several men to stay behind with Glass,
only Glass' son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) and young Jim Bridger (Son of
Rambow's Will Poulter) volunteer, Henry ups the reward when Fitzgerald
mentions the likelihood of the boys and Glass being killed, Fitzgerald
volunteers also. Fitzgerald promises Henry to stay with Glass until he
dies and give him a proper burial, but once separated from the hunting
party Fitzgerald tries to kill Glass, who cannot speak while wounded,
by smothering him, Hawk stumbles on this, and Fitzgerald kills him
while Glass watches in agony, Bridger returns and Fitzgerald claims he
does not know where Hawk is, and makes up seeing Indians, though
Bridger is hesitant he agrees with Fitzgerald to leave Glass behind,
leaving behind a canteen with a carved spiral on it. Glass, put in a
shallow grave covered in earth, finds strength, though struggling to
recover, to crawl away, walking through the woods and surviving feeding
on roots, the same Arikara who attacked earlier are tracking him, the
chief is looking for his kidnapped daughter, Glass narrowly avoids a
confrontation at the river by floating down the rapids. Meanwhile Henry
and the surviving hunting party have reached their nearly dilapidated
barracks outpost, Fitzgerald and Bridger make their way to the outpost,
Bridger realises Fitzgerald was lying to leave Glass behind, Fitzgerald
intimidates him into keeping silent, and when they reach the outpost
Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk disappeared, Henry
gives him his reward, Bridger refuses his payment. Glass encounters
Hikuc (Arthur RedCloud), a friendly Native American, who like him seeks
revenge, the Pawnee builds Glass a shelter during a blizzard, and the
next morning Glass finds his friend hanged, he was murdered by French
pelt hunters camped nearby, he rescues an Indian girl being raped, this
is in fact the kidnapped daughter of the chief, he takes the Pawnee's
horse that the French hunters stole, he accidentally leaves behind the
canteen with the spiral carving. Glass encounters the Arikara, but
escapes falling off a cliff, killing the horse and wounding himself
further, Glass keeps himself warm during the night in the hollowed
horse corpse, while back at the outpost a lone hunter is found carrying
the canteen, a search party is organised, Fitzgerald realises Glass
must still be alive, so he empties the outpost safe and flees. Henry's
group eventually find Glass and bring him back to the outpost, furious
Henry fails in finding Fitzgerald in a search, Glass assures Henry that
Bridger was lied to, and is released from imprisonment for treason,
Henry intends to bring back Fitzgerald dead or alive, Glass insists on
coming with him. Henry and Glass split up to approach Fitzgerald from
separate angles, but Fitzgerald ambushes and kills Henry, Glass finds
him deceased, but sets up a trap to trick Fitzgerald, he gets shot in
the shoulder, Glass chases him to the river bank where they fight.
Glass stops himself killing Fitzgerald, remembering words from the
Pawnee, so he instead pushes heavily wounded Fitzgerald downstream,
into the hands of the approaching Arikara, the chief, with his daughter
returned, kills Fitzgerald and spares Glass, in the end Glass has
completed his revenge, but his flashing visions of his dead wife and
son will remain. Also starring Paul Anderson as Anderson, Kristoffer
Joner as Murphy, Joshua Burge as Stubby Bill, Lukas Haas as Jones,
Brendan Fletcher as Fryman and Duane Howard as Elk Dog. DiCaprio as the
shaggy frontiersman gives a superb award winning performance as the
real man struggling through savagery and harsh conditions, and Hardy is
also fantastic as the menacing villain who leaves him for dead, the
supporting stars are good too. This true story set in the wilderness of
1820s America, about revenge, redemption and survival is an astonishing
watch, watching the man alone fighting to stay alive, and punish those
who betrayed him, with fantastic cinematography, natural lighting and
intense emotion, it is a brilliant must see historical revenge
adventure. It is nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the
Year, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best
Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Sound Mixing, Best
Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, it is nominated the BAFTAs for
Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Original Music for
Ryuichi Sakamoto and Carsten Nicolai, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Sound,
and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was
nominated for Best Original Score. Outstanding!

I am not sure why they portray it as a revenge saga.Revenge is
definitely a part, a big part of it.But to call it a story of revenge
only is like calling a sea just a pool of brackish water.There are so
many interwoven philosophies, that when the revenge does take place,
you are already taken away to a mystic world, world where vengeance
means little, embarking on a journey which teaches you how to survive
the worst, life has offered you and yet come up with a spirit to endure
more, to invite more and to sustain till the last breath of life
becomes everything.Since my teenage, I have always rooted for Leo to
win an Oscar every time he gets a nomination since 'What's eating
Gilbert Grape'.And every time, as Leo returned empty handed, my heart
went down as if it was the last time.But he came back with a bang every
time.And continued winning 4 more nominations.And continued returning
bare handed.But this time, while I watched the masterpiece saga' The
Revenant', something deep inside started saying' Yes, it's the time'.In
every frame, in every moment, it makes you feel, this was just made for
him to win an Oscar.Because what Leo delivered here, is something you
can not look beyond in any acting dictionary to better.What a visual
treat Alejandro González Iñárritu has given you in this epic tale of
survival!Every frame becomes etched in your mind as if you are living
in the world construed by him.When I had watched this movie, it was yet
to win 12 Academy nominations.But I was certain that it was a sure
entry for the cinematography.The mountains, the river, the water, the
blood, the snow, the ridges- everything so vividly portrayed.Tom Hardy
did an exceptional job as the villain.It must have been an extreme
difficult job for an actor of his stature to portray second fiddle.But
there lies his finesse.The background score is fabulous, too.Overall a
movie you hardly affor to miss.Fantastic -'The Revenant'.

Watching "Birdman" for the third time, I viewed it just to appreciate
the cinematography. On first viewing I only wanted to immerse myself in
what was promised to be a groundbreaking and highly enjoyable trip to
the theater; it was, in no small measure. When you spend the entirety
of the film looking for a "cut," you aren't absorbing, you are
monitoring. Knowing that Inarritu was using the great cinematographer
Emmanuel Lubeszki again for "The Revenant," it was a chore not to
measure cut lengths, camera movement, and blocking. This was not a
distraction, just an affirmation that I would need to see this film
again, and again simply for appreciation.The broad-strokes of this film's plot are centered in truth. Hugh Glass
was a figure of legend in South Dakota where I was raised. His story
wasn't introduced along with John Henry or Wild Bill Hickok; his was
reserved for older students, so that gruesome details and exaggerations
could be employed without censorship. I heard of "The Toughest Man in
History." The basic story is widely known, Hugh Glass was a
frontiersman in the early 19th century who fell victim to a vicious
grizzly bear mauling. With cold weather setting in, the members of his
hunting party were not keen on hefting a near-corpse 200 miles to their
fort-base. Consensus was that he would not recover and he was left with
2 volunteers to see him through to a dignified passing. These
volunteers waited in vain for his last stubborn breath, and left him
half-buried in the wilderness. The facts of his survival and journey
after the matter have been molded by time into something formulaic and
unabashedly compelling. If this film takes liberties with the truth,
how far off can they be?This story doesn't build to a finale so much as sustain a continued
agony that is bearable to the viewer through character perseverance and
beautiful filmmaker craft. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't demand pity for
his situation, he doesn't relent in his drive long enough to evoke
sympathetic emotions. From the first mechanically shot battle sequence,
we are spectators to this man, and we don't want to leave him. The
world that Glass resides in is beyond hostile, and there is very little
reason why we should want him to survive so badly, but that feeling is
sustained throughout. Revenge becomes a murky motivation until it needs
a boost. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald gives us plenty of reason to see
Glass through to the end and exact it.Fitzgerald is the soulless volunteer who callously leaves Hugh for dead
and sees the world as carrying a debt that is owed to him. The pacing
of Glass's survival juxtaposed to Fitzgerald's damnable existence back
at base, fuel the audiences involvement in exquisite balance. Anytime
you wonder "What is Glass even fighting for anymore?" Hardy steals a
scene that demands retribution. Aside from Fitzgerald and the terrain,
the local Native American Pawnee tribe are a continued threat, always
fast on Glass's heals. As overwhelming as this may seem, there is never
a moment where it doesn't feel authentic.Due to the sustained tension throughout this movie, the climax doesn't
pack the punch we are accustomed to. There is an unnecessary use of
Dues Ex Machina in the final moments that doesn't hurt the plot, but
makes it feel needlessly formulaic. Long-takes blended in with seamless
choreography of action make this a prime candidate for Best Picture and
Cinematography. Leo's performance is second to none this year. And it
should be noted that if Inarritu pulls off an Oscar for directing, it
will be the third consecutive Mexican won award, his second in a row.
This is a great year for film, and whatever the cast and crew of The
Revenant walk away with in February, I begrudge them nothing.

Films are works of art, pieces not to be taken for granted, unless they
are ones that want to be taken for granted. There is a new term for the
word masterpieceRevenant!!Unbelievable, breath taking, exhilarating, these descriptions are not
enough to describe this wonderful movie. When left for dead by the rest of his military group, Hugh Glass
(DiCaprio) must look death in the face and battle great woodlands to
seek vengeance on the one who betrayed him. DiCaprio is mind blowing in
his performance that looks so convincing, you'll believe he actually
went through it. You do not recognise this man at all in his
performance, there is no sign of Belfort, Jack Dawson, or Cobb,
DiCaprio shows us a completely new person, you won't believe he is even
an actor. FWI I am being deadly serious here, not joking at all. One of the most
unique parts of the film, is the use in cinematography, the most
effective, and beautiful use I have ever seen. It pulls you in to the
film, and you completely feel the rush of the film through your body. Alejandro González Iñárritu has pulled of another remarkable, and
stunning piece of cinema, that will take you to a whole new world of
film. It may be long, but every moment pulls you closer.This truly is the most amazing, beautiful, and unbelievable film I have
ever seen, and is now close to becoming the best. It's a whole new
experience and must be viewed in cinemas. It's a complete 10/10, and
must be viewed by all film fans.

Well I watched The Revenant earlier and to be brutally honest it was
boring as hell.The opening and the ending were good, but the middle just dragged. I
was bored for a good 2/3rds of the film and kept wanting it to get on
with it and tell a story already. It is at least an hour too long.Does Leonardo deserve an Oscar for this role? Most definitely not. It
definitely wouldn't make my top 5 DiCaprio films, hell it struggles to
make it into the top 10.Doesn't deserve best movie either, in fact it doesn't even deserve a
nomination.It could win Oscar's for Cinematography, Makeup and Hairstyling and for
Costume Design. Those were all outstanding. As was Tom Hardy he out
acted Leo in every scene he had, so did Domhnall Gleeson to be honest.I gave this a 6 on IMDb, purely for the cinematography and
costume/makeup and supporting cast. Story was far too slow and you
could have cast a log instead of DiCaprio.

While my review of the Hateful Eight gave it some latitude since the
violence was, at least, directly tied to the plot, The Revenent is a
movie whose violence is over the top. We cannot fault Leonardo DiCaprio
for his excellent acting, not the special effects that allowed much of
this movie to be filmed.But, how long ago do you think it was that this movie would have been
X-Rated? We have become inured to violence and that is a bad thing for
all of us but especially the younger generation. Seeing extremely
violent movies is NOT the same as the imaginary characters of comic
books 50 years ago. The movies are SO real that the line between
violence in the real world and violence in the movies has blurred.Have we inadvertently caused the more violent culture around us. I
think we have and we should be afraid of the consequences.

The Revenant is a really good achievement in cinema that I enjoyed.
Don't think the 6 is meant to be as a diss, I just reserve the higher
numbers for rewatchable films. It is a straight-forward story of
revenge in which Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is after John
Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). I feel like the way this movie was pitched was
what all can we do to Leo to finally get him an Oscar. I mean his
character goes through so many setbacks on his quest for revenge which
is very entertaining to watch if at sometimes pushing the unbelievable
mark. WARNING - This is a very, very brutal film with lots of blood,
intense and violent images. I cannot use the word intense enough to
describe the film.THE MAJOR PLAYERS (5 Best):Director - Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Best 3 Credits - 21 Grams,
Babel, and Birdman)Cinematographer - Emmanuel Lubeski (Best 3 Credits - Gravity, Children
of Men, and Sleepy Hollow)Leonardo DiCaprio - The Departed, Django Unchained, and InceptionTom Hardy - Bronson, The Dark Knight Rises, and LegendDomhnall Gleeson - Ex Machina, About Time, and True GritHONORABLE MENTION - After his horrible acting in Maze Runner, Will
Poulter totally redeemed himself. His dramatic acting in this movie
gives me hope. I new he had good comedic timing in We're the Millers. I
totally believed his inner turmoil in this movie.MVP - Sorry Leo but Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar for his performance. So
brutal and unforgiving. He must be a real A-Hole in real life cause he
was perfect at playing a horrible character with no redeeming
qualities.THE VERDICT - I would recommend seeing the film in Theaters but I don't
think I will see the film again.If you liked the film The Grey, you will like this movie.

After having seen The Revenant, I can truly say it is one of the
greatest films I have ever seen. Every element of this movie is handled
expertly, with people who have a genuine love for their craft.
Alejandro González Iñárritu has once again outdone himself, as he did
with his excellent Birdman from last year. Of the movies that came out
in 2015, only The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road truly blew my mind. The Revenant has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever
laid eyes on. While most movies feature quick-cut editing and shaky cam
in their action scenes, The Revenant blew my mind with single-take
action scenes with fantastic choreography. Honestly, there are some
huge action scenes in this movie with almost no cuts at all. It was
truly breathtaking to see a film where the filmmakers just let you
watch it, without having to squint and lean forward in your chair just
to understand what is happening on screen. In The Revenant, you just
stare in awe and soak in the things happening on screen.Now, let's talk about the acting. Leonardo Dicaprio has proved time and
time again that he is one of the greatest actors working today. This
may have been his best performance yet. It's a much different
performance from The Departed, The Wolf Of Wall Street, and many
others. Dicaprio's performance in The Revenant is almost entirely
physical. From the incredible stunt work to the insane method acting
used to get into character, this was the point where I didn't see
Leonardo Dicaprio, the pretty boy. I saw Hugh Glass in this movie. When
an actor does such a good job that you no longer see the character they
are portraying as that actor, that actor should be commended. In fact,
all of the acting in this movie is superb. Tom Hardy gives one of the
best performances I've ever seen from him, selling every word out of
his mouth. Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson are also very compelling,
the former giving the best performance of his career. When I left the theatre, I was shaking. The atmosphere in The Revenant
is so present and strong that I was shivering in my seat, and for the
next half hour after the movie ended. Now, this movie doesn't have much
to say about society or anything like that. It isn't some profound
metaphor. It's a film about both the beauty and horror of nature. Every
scene in the film feels gritty and real. The Revenant is the first
movie I have gone to in a very long time that I can call an experience.

Trapper and guide, Hugh Glass, while guiding the survivors of a party
decimated in an Indian attack, is mauled by a bear and left for dead
while his son is killed. Glass struggles to survive in an incredibly
hostile environment, so that he can return to exact retribution on
Fitzgerald, who killed his son.I have mixed feelings about this visceral but beautiful movie. Directed
by Alejando Inarritu, it shows, if anything, even more directorial
flamboyance than his Oscar-winning Birdland, and is undoubtedly less
likely to divide opinion quite as markedly. The opening sequence of the
Indian attack is staggeringly well filmed, in lengthy unbroken shots
where the camera makes movements which seem impossible. The movie is a
feast for the eyes - the scenery is spectacular, the action is
brilliantly choreographed and photographed, the special effects are
astonishing (you can't see where they finish and reality ends)  and,
all the time, the camera is endlessly prowling around and through the
action. Every second on screen shows what a challenging shoot this was.But there are flaws. At over two and a half hours, it is at least half
an hour too long  Glass' wilderness wandering could usefully have been
trimmed down. And demanding shoot or not, DiCaprio's almost
dialogue-less performance is more grimacing than acting. Tom Hardy
sounds authentic but largely incomprehensible as Fitzgerald. Inarritu
is far too fond of shots of the sky up through pine trees  the first
one was gorgeous, the 21st smacked of "Get on with it." The payback on
the kidnapped Indian girl is muddled from a story point of view.
Frankly, I didn't believe Glass would have survived: not just the bear
attack, but the repeated soakings for extended periods in freezing
water. And the film is very dark and desaturated, a trend which I have
lost patience with.It is definitely worth seeing, but I don't think I'm that keen on
seeing it again soon.

Sometimes two movies come out at the same time and share a lot of
elements even though they're completely unrelated. For example, the
parallels between two films which both came out in limited release on
December 25, 2015 (even though one went into wide release before the
other) are striking. I'm referring to "The Hateful Eight" and "The
Revenant" (R, 2:36).Both movies take place in the 19th century American west, are set
completely in the wilderness and include a lot of snow. In both films,
men die by shootings and stabbings, women are abused and even killed,
someone takes a drink and ends up spitting out blood, at one point,
there's a naked man wandering in the cold and, later on, someone is
hanged. Each movie even contains a brief scene in which someone catches
snowflakes with the tongue. I could go on, but suffice it to say
there's an unusual number of similarities between these two films,
considering how different they are. While "The Hateful Eight" is a
completely fictional tale with multi-layered characters, an interesting
story and even some light-hearted moments, "The Revenant" is an even
simpler story, which is mainly about one man, and is dead serious  and
even semi-fictional."The Revenant" is the film adaptation of Michael Punke's 2002 novel of
the same name, which is inspired by a true story. The book takes some
liberties with the truth. The film takes even more. The truth in the
story is that, in 1823, fur trapper Hugh Glass was attacked by a
grizzly bear and left for dead by his companions, but, having been
abandoned, he still managed to limp, shuffle and crawl over 200 miles
to Fort Kiowa in present-day South Dakota.This is another one of those movies (like "In the Heart of the Sea")
which, rather than just telling a fictional story with fictional
characters, takes an incredible true story and uses the names of real
people, but also inserts main characters which weren't part of the
actual story, changes the motivations and fates of the real people and
tells a story of half-truths. Well beyond taking dramatic license,
films like this often leave many people with a perpetual misperception
of historical events that will never be corrected. (I'm saying all this
now, because doing so during my plot summary would result in spoilers.)
Leonardo DiCaprio plays Glass, an experienced hunter and guide who once
lived with the Pawnee Indians, married a Pawnee woman and, in the
movie, has a teenage Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) with him on this
particular expedition. When the men come under a sudden and brutal
attack by a group of Arikara Indians (Rees, for short), they run for
their boats, carrying as many bundles of their beaver pelts as they can
get away with. Having lost over 30 men in the attack, Captain Andrew
Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), the leader of the quasi-military hunting
party, rallies his remaining men and orders them to start heading back
to their trading post at Fort Kiowa.With the journey barely underway, Glass is attacked by a large brown
bear protecting her cubs. He is mauled so badly that the men in his
party hold out no hope for his survival. It becomes impossible for them
to carry him over the increasingly rough terrain, so Henry leaves Glass
in the care of his son, Hawk, the young Jim Bridger (Will Poulter), and
experienced trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). "When" Glass dies,
they are to bury him properly and then catch up with the group.
Fitzgerald, unfortunately, is a man who only cares about protecting his
own hide and selling as many beaver hides as he can. He soon takes
actions which prevent the two young men from staying and looking after
Glass.The rest of the movie remains focused primarily on DiCaprio's
character, but tells three stories simultaneously. Glass basically
wills himself to survive and improve enough to try to get himself to
Fort Kiowa. Still badly injured, he literally drags himself toward his
destination, doing his best to survive in spite of his wounds, the
rough terrain, the worsening weather conditions and lack of food. He
also has to make sure that he steers clear of the Rees. They continue
to be a presence throughout the film, as their chief (Anthony
Starlight) leads his men in search of his missing daughter (Melaw
Nakehk'o), whom he believes was taken by white men in the area.
Meanwhile, the men who left Glass behind are making their way back to
their trading post, unaware that Glass is still alive  and is coming
for his revenge."The Revenant" is a great achievement in some ways, but not a great
film. The main reason to see this movie is the acting, especially
DiCaprio's performance. Leo completely immerses himself in his
character's suffering and deserves an Oscar for everything he went
through to deliver such a powerful performance. The problem with the
movie is that it's almost all about the central character's physical
and emotional pain, making for one depressing movie. The scenes of the
bear attack and one harrowing escape from the Rees are both remarkable,
but dragging out this character's suffering for as long as co-writer
and director Alejandro González Iñárritu does, makes for an
unnecessarily long movie. However, the movie's eventful final thirty
minutes did help justify the time I had invested. Seeing this film is
an endurance test  physically, emotionally and intellectually (for
those of us who know how the story really unfolded)  but seeing Leo
portray his character's endurance so effectively is just this side of
being worth it. "B"

I've seen it three times and still I feel the need to watch it once
more. "The Revenant" is teaching us a life lesson: "As long as you can
still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe. Keep breathing. When there
is a storm, and you stand in front of a tree, if you look at its
branches, you swear it will fall. But if you watch the trunk, you will
see its stability." Alejandro González Iñárritu feels by heart every
inch of his conducted orchestra, his painted fresco, his wonderfully
talented cast & crew: Iñárritu is the master of this game! Leonardo
DiCaprio deserves his long waited Oscar and this movie is indeed a
masterpiece of cinematography.

I gave the film a 6 because it was advertised as a very action filled
revenge movie...but what it delivered was a painfully slow movie that
was woefully short on action or revenge.If you are looking for visually appealing film, grand shots of
mountains, snow, rivers, fog, and water...you'll get a lot of that in
the movie. The problem is that you get about an hour and a half too
much of that.I know it took a lot of work to film this thing...and the camera work
truly is great...that's the only reason I didn't give it a 3. It's so slow that you can not only get up to go to the bathroom at just
about any point and not miss anything...you could probably make some
phone calls and check your tire pressure while you're at it...and still
not miss anything. The first 20 minutes were pretty cool, and there
were a few short minutes toward the end that were OK...but everything
else had me trying not to fall asleep in the theater.I was begging for this movie to end.

This film seems unlike any revenge film to come before this one. It is
incredibly well-shot, it is brutal and intense, well-acted, and it
takes place in the early days of America when Native Americans and
Caucasians didn't get along so well. Tension between these two very
broad groups is what drives the action in the film's opening sequence,
and it is a motif throughout the film.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh Glass, a man who raised a young Native
American named Hawk on his own after the boy's parents either abandoned
him or died in a battle. Glass fights a bear and miraculously survives
to be buried alive by Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who wants to cash in on
this "service" since he has somewhat of a feud with Glass and does not
want to see him live. It is unclear whether Glass is okay with this
since he technically "makes a deal" with Fitzgerald, but Glass gains
the will to fight for survival once he realizes Hawk was killed by
Fitzgerald.A huge chunk of the film is devoted to following Glass' journey to
return to his community, and this proves to be visually beautiful, but
also causes the film to feel slow at points. There are incredible shots
of Glass in relation to the land around him, which proves to show
scenery and landscapes in a poetic manner. One impressive shot is a
tracking shot which moves from an extreme wide shot which focuses on
the mountains with Glass as tiny as an ant in the distance and
eventually moves to a close-up on the same character. There are many
long takes in the film that are executed brilliantly, some during
action sequences and some when Glass is simply walking on his journey.
However, as the story follows Glass on his journey, some of the scenic
shots go on too long and seem monotonous since we understand that Glass
has to go a long way, but the film keeps reminding us this with more
and more scenic shots that don't move the story along.DiCaprio is at his best here, and will probably receive his fifth Oscar
nomination for acting. Whether or not he will actually win the award as
fans often complain about, his performance in The Revenant will live on
in history. Glass' desperation comes across very convincingly even
though DiCaprio does not even need to speak throughout a lot of the
movie. That's the real acting - when actors can express emotions and
motivation clearly through body language rather than how they handle
dialogue.Every action sequence in this movie is incredible. Most are done in
just a few long takes which means these sequences needed to be really
well-choreographed in order to get the shots right. And these sequences
were on location rather than in a studio, so one has to respect the
direction and the cinematography that was done with amazing effort
outside in cold environments.If there is one thing to take away from The Revenant it is the visuals.
It's funny that not many movies are done this way today even though
filmmakers know that film is a very visual medium. Innaritu understands
this very well as we can see in Birdman as well as in this movie, and
hopefully he inspires the next generation of filmmakers to follow in
his footsteps.3.5/4.0

An impressive synthesis of even poorer audio quality than Brokeback
Mountain; considerably duller than Dances With Wolves-and contains
about as much high class cinematography as a gratuitous wet fart on the
set of the Blair Witch Project. However if you enjoy Leonardo grappling
around dressed in the pelt of a bear in the wilderness along with
listening to Tom Hardy's incomprehensible slurs for well over two
hours- then this film is for you. If, however you prefer something
which has more substance, a well articulated and interesting plot and
acting that is worthy of an Oscar, I would perhaps avoid this film more
so than the bubonic plague. I found the whole film to be utterly
painful to watch, needlessly long and an unfortunate and irredeemable
waste of time. Watch Star Wars instead for goodness sake.

There have been two masterpieces in cinema this year. In Mad Max Fury
Road, George Miller gifted us a dystopian deconstruction of the
inevitable consequences of the will to own: a society both totalitarian
and nihilistic, headed by an obscenely controlling monster commanding
drug fueled Jihadis, regulating every resource from water to mother's
milk. Misread in some places with a strictly "feminist" critique,
exegesis of Miller's film can fly marxian or libertarian  it hardly
matters as the solution to the chaos of dictatorship the director
provided with Furiosa's victory was both egalitarianism and freedom.In The Revenant, Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu attempts something more
subtle: with one stroke of his pen, by giving protagonist Hugh Glass a
native wife and son, he weds an early icon of American Exceptionalism
into a matrimony of Old World and New. It was not long after Glass's
travails that ambitious frontier writers grew his legend, and by the
end of the 19th century Glass had entered a pantheon of American
folklore heroes from the wholly fictitious Paul Bunyon, to the richly
documented Davy Crockett. The historical Glass fell somewhere between
symbolic characters like Johnny Appleseed and fictionalized pioneer
figures such as Daniel Boone. Glass's place among these icons ebbed and
flowed with each new literary interpretation, but none has challenged
his role as an early representation of the American cultural values
based on Puritan work ethic, Calvinist Pre-Destination, and economic
liberalism. By the time Thoreau poetically stamped naturalism on the
emerging national character, the attributes of perseverance, "rugged
individualism", and emotional solitude had solidified into the
championing of an individual persona that collectively birthed the
philosophies and policies of American Exceptionalism and Manifest
Destiny.Wholly within a European tradition, neither Glass's experience nor
iconography made room for a shared native American narrative. The value
of communalism, spiritual communication with the natural world, and
preservation of the environment were never compatible with the mission
to homogenize and control that environment with ever increasing
technological advancements. Native lifestyles and beliefs, in
particular the unwillingness to entertain the notion that land could
ever be privately owned, doomed any hope for a co-existence of equals.
But in the Revenant, Iñárritu suggests that Glass's almost super human
fortitude and survival skills were sourced not just from the core early
American cultural value of self-sufficiency, but from the First
Nationer acceptance of nature as a reverential if temperamental
partner; a mate not to be dominated and contained, but to be respected
and cajoled into compatibility. In the face of the arbitrary brutality
of nature, it is not Glass's master of technology that saves him, it is
his native-like learned connection to the spirit world and his
understanding of the natural world that restore and guide him. Glass is
a man with a foot planted firmly in both worlds, but it is his chosen
one that is both sacrificed in the person of his son Hawk, and
transcended in the visions of his dead wife and son. On his recovery
and "revenge" mission, his sustenance is derived from animism; his
survival from a native conciliation with the harsh environment.I believe in The Revenant the film-maker wants his audience to
extrapolate the sources and resources of Glass's survival and consider
the role that native peoples had in the formation and growth of a
nation, to ponder and accept the importance that native people's
beliefs and practices had and still have in creating a harmonious
balance between a natural world that is and will always be capable of
demolishing the best plans and inventions of men, and the harnessing of
that world in the name of advancement. Iñárritu's revision of the Glass
story is not a mere plot device; it is a radical epistemological one
that poses timeless questions. I do feel the wonderful performances,
majestic cinematography, and riveting action in The Revenant are all
subordinate to what the director would like us to entertain about the
survival and "revenge" of Hugh Glass.

How can i hate this movie? I have watched many movies, over hundreds,
but there have been few movies in which I was literally smiling the
whole way trough. I almost never do that. But experience aside, I'm
here to tell people how the movie is. It's one of the best I've ever
seen. I'll set aside the fact that I have a soft spot for Dicaprio in
movies, so let's begin. The story is great, yet simple. This movie made
it work. You live with the characters and their experience, and their
struggle for survival and revenge. Now the acting is also great,
everything is very subtle and never overdoing it. Hugh Glass was known
as a very serious man, yet Leo makes him sympathetic. Tom Hardy is a
giant creep, while the side actors pull off a great job too. Music fits
the ambiance perfectly. Cinematography is of course the best (the best
I've seen if I may say so) everything is believable and it works
perfectly. Now I've heard many complaints about this movie regarding
the dreams in this movie, which take up like 3 minutes or something, so
I'm not gonna be a hard-ass about it. Also many people don't believe
the struggles Dicaprio's character goes trough, but let me say this:
IT'S A TRUE STORY of course they didn't follow every detail because the
story is rather unknown, but be honest, how much do we know about
survival and falling off cliffs and such? The makers of the movie
probably did a lot of research I'll rest my case if anybody goes trough
the same problems Hugh Glass goes trough in the movie and dies. In my
opinion this was the best movie of the year and a very welcome
surprise. Leo, you deserved that Oscar man. Enjoy it

I think that THE REVENANT is one of my all-time favorite's movies! I'm
so Glad that Dicaprio won an Oscar. I'm a little bit disappointed that
Hardy didn't. the acting in this movie is some of the best acting these
eyes have ever seen. the battle sequences were so well hemmed and the
cinematography is beautiful. I would highly recommend watching this
movie! so, I went to see this for my 14th birthday and I have to say, I
was really surprised at how well the producers and the director did and
how well all of the amazing actors did! I'm definitely buying this
movie on Blu-ray and DVD. I was walking into this move not expecting a
whole lot. I was expecting it to be a movie filled with blood and guts.
it is. but the movie doesn't focus in on blood and guts. it turned out
to be a movie about the essence of life and survival

The opening sequences are fantastic and should be seen on as big a
screen as possible. Tom Hardy's character was by far the most
multi-dimensional and characteristic. The cinematography was
astonishing in every aspect, the acting  was great, but the story was
monotonous and slow paced. Good cinematography and camera-work, and
superb acting all round. From the films I have seen so far it should
definitely win Best Cinematography. The scenery and backdrops are epic
in scale and totally immersive. Tom Hardy blows Leo off screen for
acting ability in this movie. Leo's role had a lot of crawling and
moaning and groaning compared to what Hardy's role where in certain
scenes he spoke with his eyes. The natural landscape and some of the
scenes are overwhelming and spectacular! Sadly, this film borrows too
much from the equations of Saving Private Ryan, (extraordinary opening
battle scene) n Gladiator with snow, (the wife and son flashbacks were
way too similar and predictable). Tom Hardy adds a lively touch to a
rather slow film. He's menacing, truly intimidating and sometimes, his
eyes speak more than his actions. I was wondering why a fish would be
eaten raw when there is a fire just feet away? The story itself is a
typical survival tale, rote and predictable, with more than a touch of
Terrance Mallick's inspiration. The Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki
is very similar to what he did in Mallick's movies. Mirrione has had a
notable collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh n he did a
terrific job in all Ocean's trilogy but with Alejandro he gets lazy. He
did a lazy job for Babel n again a lazy job for the revenant. This is
the type of film you must see in the theaters, the experience is just
heart pounding and exciting but in the past there have been better
survival n revenge dramas. Sure thing, everyone likes Leo including me.
He deserves an Oscar but at least not for this role.

​The Revenant is a story about survival and revenge !! But the thing
which stands out for me was the Picturisation. It has one of the most
beautiful cinematography,capturing the breathtaking landscapes, the
mauling of a Bear (my god, it looked completely original, at least for
me) and the first & last 10 minutes of gory gruesome violence, all in a
single movie !! I don't mind even if Leo wins an Oscar or not for this
but the Oscar needs to be given for the Best Cinematography for this
movie !!Though the run time maybe a bit long, one must need patience to
experience a jaw dropping visual spectacle.The Revenant is a 'Bloody' Violence amidst Beautiful, Alluring and
Serene nature !!

Iñárritu has brilliantly executed the survival and revenge
saga.Sometimes this movie remind you combination of Cast away and
Gladiator. Leonardo has mesmerized the audience with his performance.
Definitely he deserve a Oscar for this one otherwise loss for Oscars,
not Leonardo. Hardy as a bad guy was equally brilliant through the
movie. Action sequences were good especially Bear and Glass
combat.Background score was unique especially in the climax. There are
lots of Spirituality in this saga. Brilliant Cinematography by Emmanuel
covering virgin locations, Snow covered mountains, Water fall, Wild
forest.

In my opinion, best movie of the year. Best actor. Best screenplay.
Best everything. A must see movie. Movies like this I watch it at least
once every ten years. This way I forget about Most of the movie and I
can enjoy watching it again. I'm a big fan of Leo, and I think this is
his biggest film of them all. Great movie. I recommend this movie to
anyone. Fully drama story, active story. Definitely one of the best
acting I've ever seen. February 28th, Oscars. If it's not won by Leo,
then I will loose faith of him ever winning one. I give this movie 10
stars because of the none blinking moments. I had my eyes wide open
most of the movie, Leonardo's acting was just over the wall! Tom Hardy
did a great job complementing the movie. Both great actors. I saw this
movie the very first day it was released, I went by myself, desperately
wanting to see this movie, and I left the movie wanting to go buy
another ticket and watch it right there again. I absolutely loved this
movie.

A frontiersman on a fur trading expedition in the 1820s fights for
survival after being mauled by a bear and left for dead by members of
his own hunting team.The Revenant is a brutal hymn to the beauty and terror of the natural
world. The movie opens with a moment of serene beauty - almost
Terrence-Malick-like. This film is filled with striking passages of
pure cinema, it has some of the best cinematography my eyes have ever
seen and I mean that. These scenes help the audience overcome the film
considerable length and extreme carnage at time. There were moments in
this very lengthy runtime where I gazed in awe watching some of the
shots they were able to accomplish and I genuinely do not understand
how they got them. Revenge, as goes the old Klingon proverb, is a dish best served cold.
This movie is as much a film about revenge as it is about men. An epic
about the existential extremes, human beings will go to for revenge.
Well, that and witnessing one of Hollywood's biggest stars endure a
Passion of the Christ-like beating from man, beast and nature. The near
constant threat of death from predators, starvation and exposure,
combine into an impressive study of Human endurance and isolation that
makes up the film's strong midsection. Most importantly Leonardo DiCaprio's raw performance helps elevate what
could have been just another man-versus-nature drama, even if he has
very minimal dialogue and most of it is not even in English. This man
has done everything at this point, but still manage to constantly
surprised us. Though, no ones ever seen him suffer for his art quite so
vividly on screen before. Now onto this Oscar nomination. He should
have won a few time at this point and most of us are rooting for him
with all our hearts; but right now it doesn't really matter anymore. A
statuette doesn't actually matter. However, the performances he's been
given us in his movies: THAT matters. Moreover, the supporting cast is
uniformly terrific, from Domhnall Gleeson to Will Poulter and, of
course, Tom Hardy.Tom Hardy is in fact also very good, even if his lines are the least
intelligible element of the masterfully brilliant sound design. He
tends to fall back into this habit he has to mumble - sometimes hitting
Batman-Bane or Mad Max-Max level. Generally immersive movies enclose, they put you inside, they dunk you
down into what it is supposed to feel like. Here, the cinematography do
the opposite: it exposes you to the elements. You are out in the cold,
in the snow, under this grey sky. The imagery, with these primal
landscapes and impressive natural lightning, is sublime. Some director
may have been tempted to follow an Oscar win by a cushy comedy; But
Alejandro Gonzàlez Inàrritu pushed himself and his crew to the limits
against the elements. He defied conventional wisdom by shooting with
natural light only, in chronological order and by doing so, has emerged
with something we have never seen before. You almost feel uncomfortable
watching this film for entertainment. The Revenant is filled with
mesmerising violent piece of action choreography. The fights were
dirty. Especially one jaw-droopingly limber steady-cam shot which
pursues a character until he's killed, then switches to the killer
until he's dispatched too and so on. It would look like showing off if
it weren't so effective. No spoilers, but this scene involving a bear is an amazing achievement.
I don't know how they did it. I have no clue. When it was over, it took
me a few minutes to lift my jaw off my lap. This scene is intense in
the sense that it looks actually real. This film is so realistic that
you would never ever want to hike in the woods if you see it, ever
again. Overall, The Revenant is a filmmaking triumph. You cannot afford to
miss experiencing this on the big screen. It's a brutal, disturbing,
violent movie in which it is one man against nature, and nature is not
playing nice.

Let's be clear, I've had huge expectations regarding Inaritu's "The
Revenant". And after watching it yesterday night, I feel like I'm
finally up to the task of writing a small review of it.First of all, I'm a fan of Inaritu, and this is probably one of the
most cinematographic movies I've ever seen. Some landscapes are just
breath-taking and the way he chose to film some scenes makes me believe
that, after "Birdman", Inaritu is showing himself as one of the best
directors out there.I've seen almost every Di Caprio's movies, and since "What's Eating
Gilbert Grape", I hadn't seen any role in which he had such great
power. Really an intense performance, keeping in mind that they had to
film it in cold conditions.I have been disappointed in Tom Hardy's, feeling like he just thought
"Well, now that I'm bankable, I can just act in a basic way and still
be acclaimed" - apart from his accent, nothing too fancy to see in his
acting performance in The Revenant.2 hours and 40 minutes felt like 4 hours at some points. I think some
scenes could've been deleted, or at least shortened.The Revenant is a bit of a deception, maybe I had too high
expectations. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but not the
masterpiece the critics are selling us.This might be a "light" review, but since I believe a lot of you are
going to see it, I didn't want to spoil or talk too much about the
story itself and things related.I rate it 7 out of 10, but keep in mind that if it was not for Inaritu
and Di Caprio, the rate would've been much lower.

I think of myself as an amateur film critic, and because of that I
often find myself being let down by movies that are popular with mass
audiences. I tend to be critical of things that others never notice,
it's not at all unusual for me to go see the latest blockbuster that
everyone is talking about and leave feeling quite let down. As such, I
went into "The Revenant" with a bit of skepticism--it's getting rave
reviews, but would it really be as good as everyone is saying? I
assumed that the answer was probably no.That said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie is one of
the best films in recent memory. Indeed, "instant classic" is not too
strong a term here. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a pioneer in the American
west whose party is attacked by Indians. The attack leaves the group's
numbers decimated, and DiCaprio spends most of the movie injured beyond
hope of recovery, only to regain his health and have to overcome the
wild frontier to meet back up with his lost group of explorers.One of the things that makes this movie great is that it is in every
way a bona fide "Western", but without the hackneyed conventions of
most films in that genre. You won't find any cowboy hats in this movie,
or a soundtrack from a spaghetti flick. The film is based on real
events that occurred in 1823, and as such the attire and wardrobe of
the cast is firmly "pioneer". And yet, the movie is nothing if not
accurately called a cowboys and Indians film--indeed, probably the most
realistic such film to have ever been made, at least so far as showing
tensions between natives and Europeans. And the film's climax is as
intriguing and suspenseful as any Western out there--no marching ten
paces to turn and shoot type of thing, mind you, but an epic showdown
between the film's main characters.If I had to offer up any criticism for this movie it would be the
simple fact that I find it impossible to see Leonardo DiCaprio as
whatever role he's playing these days. Sure, he's a good actor, and he
certainly put himself through a lot to make this movie. But I still
felt like I was watching Leonardo DiCaprio, not the character he was
assigned to play. That doesn't make his performance bad--it just means
that the film might have benefited from going with a different actor
who wasn't quite so overused at this point. The movie is strong enough
to stand on its own merits without DiCaprio's presence--but this one
qualm aside, Dicaprio's being overused still doesn't detract from the
movie.I'd also note that the movie does start a little bit....not slow,
really, but just in a way that I found hard to get into at first.
Fortunately the story grew on me as it went along. I wasn't sure how I
felt about the direction of the film thirty minutes into things, but by
the second hour I was quite hooked.All in all, I have to give this one a perfect ten stars. I saved this
one for the last of this year's eight Best Picture nominees, having
watched all seven in a row in hopes that the crowd might be right for
once and that "The Revenant" would indeed be the Best Picture of 2015.
I enjoyed all the other movies this year, especially "The Martian",
which was my favorite going into this film. But I must say that "The
Revenant" proved to be in a class by itself. This one stands apart as
the kind of movie that isn't just enjoyable, but an iconic epic that
will be remembered for years to come. Bravo. 10/10.

Having seen previous A.G.Iñárritu's movies like Biutiful and Birdmen, I
started this one with very low expectations and mainly because Di
Caprio's genius would overcome Iñárritu's feebleness. I was surprised
to see that this time there is a story and actors are not encouraged to
overact. Frankly, the movie could be even called entertaining. And
that's where good points finish. The bad sides are typical for this
director. He sees things like red blood spilled over white snow as a
highest form of art and tries to persuade the audience with unnecessary
emphasis on guts and gore. Bud sadly, once again it's not convincing.
The worst thing about this movie is that it's completely meaningless.
Why a story like that should be told and seen - it remains a secret
between Iñárritu and his devoted fans. One of the reasons is maybe to
make people understand that if you are in the cold wilderness your best
option is to take every chance to enter waters in order to recover and
have you wounds healed. That's what Di Caprio's character did - he was
almost gone but after swimming few times in the icy water and sleeping
with his wet clothes on the snow instead of dying of hypothermia he got
better and even quit creeping and felt good enough to walk. But it
doesn't matter after all. Red blood over white snow is all that is
meaningful.

This movie is brutal, violent, and unsettling. That's what makes it so
great. That said it certainly isn't for everyone. Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is an American frontiersman traveling with his convoy
alongside his Native American son Hawk Glass (Forrest Goodluck). When
Hugh is brutally mauled by a bear and barely able to stand, Captain
Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleason) assigns Hawk, John Fitzgerald (Tom
Hardy), and Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) to look after him. But after
Fitzgerald tries to kill Hugh, Hawk is killed by Fitzgerald, and Hugh
is partially buried alive. The rest of the movie is mostly Hugh trying
to get back home. As I've previously stated it's very brutal and in
some parts, hard to watch. It's certainly not a movie for the faint
hearted, because trust me it gets intense. But if you can watch through
that, you'll be able to enjoy this for the suspense thriller it is.
It's still in theaters so if you can withstand the violence, go check
it out.

I Would have to say that this has to be the best movie of the year by
far. I Don't know why this film would even come out so early in January
in the UK and December in America. This should have been an end of the
year movie, somewhere in December and November. For me the best actor
was Tom Hardy who played the roll as the villain brilliantly and just
was too good. He was my favourite actor in this film and has to win an
Oscar for the best supporting actor. On the other hand, Leonardo
DiCaprio just proves to use why now is the time to win his Oscar for
his acting. I do prefer him in wolf of wall street but he was also good
in this film. One of the scenes that Leonardo DiCaprio has in his film was just too
good as it was so realistic, it did not feel like it was CGI or any
tools where used to make this scene look that good. It was so scary as
this scene was so real to me, it really was putting me to think like
what i would do and how i would react if i was in that situation.
Throughout the whole film you really have to give huge credits to
Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy as these two have great chemistry
working together and make this film even more watchable. You also have
to give the credit to the director Alejandro González who also directed
Birdman which is another good film that you need to watch.I Also love the location of where this film was filmed in and the
soundtrack was brilliant. If your a Tom Hardy fan, then everyone please
go and watch this film and of course if your a Leonardo DiCaprio fan
like me, then this is a most watch film. I Would also say because of
the locations and the scenes, this film should be watched at IMax.

"Wow!" That is the first word that comes to mind when I try to even
begin reviewing this movie! It was spectacular from start to finish.
One of the best movies I've seen. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of the
best performances ever and I'm very happy he is being recognized this
award season. His Golden Globe win for Best Actor, Drama was completely
deserved and I'm really crossing my fingers that we will finally see
him on the Oscars stage with a statue in hand. From the music to the
cinematography to the acting, there is not one bad thing I can say
about this movie. The bear attack had me on the edge of my seat, nearly
jumping over my husband I was so scared! It is completely incredible
that this film is a true story and Alejandro G. Iñárritu did a
tremendous job of capturing it. Three Golden Globe wins including Best
Picture, Drama is just the beginning of the amazing recognition this
film will get!

Tom Hardy for the Best Supporting Actor. Loved the movie, but Leo had
better works than this. Role does not demand and Leo does not show a
wide range of emotions in it. He froze his ass making it and his puppy
eyes right before the closing credits seemed to be looking straight at
Academy decision makers, so he will probably get it. Great
cinematography and directing.There is this stupid rule that I have to have a minimum ten lines so I
will just say that I love Detroit and that Pistons are doing well, and
I hope that Tigers win it all this year and Lions win it all in my
lifetime.

When I went to see this movie, I did not expect anything, just wanting
to see whether Leo should get finally an Oscar for this... The movie
exceeded my expectations in some ways: The picture, cut, camera
directing and cinematography altogether were absolutely amazing and
very innovative. At least I had not seen anything close to this. It
managed to give you a very intimate experience, especially of the
fighting and suffering scenes of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) - and there were
MANY of both. On the other hand... there were some flaws in the
plot/script. At the beginning, when the group has to split, the
decision regarding this one person staying behind is just so illogical,
that you can practically see the same moment the entire following plot.
The Captain of the guys (Bill Weasley, mind you) surely is a greenhorn.
And then, quite at the end, exactly the same Captain makes a totally
stupid decision by going just with another man, instead like one day
ago taking two dozens... Makes no sense, but serves the outcome. So
this was some plot-bending for the greater good, I guess. And finally,
there is the minor issue of Glass surviving his whole ordeal. I mean -
really?? How much bad luck can a single guy have?! He survives about a
dozen (you can count it) totally life- threatening situations, where
each is like a chance 1:20 to survive. It becomes a bit fairy-tail for
me at this point. Is it worth watching? Maybe. It depends on what you
are looking for. The camera-work is ingenious, but the rest... oh well,
it is just not a feeling-good-movie, I guess. Yeah. You should watch
it. Unless you don't want seeing animals die. Gosh, that was the
hardest, forget the hundred or so humans... :) Oh, and does Leo deserve
the Oscar? He did great, but I don't think this should be the time he
gets it. Even with all the suffering, bleeding, surviving,
raw-fish-eating and sleeping in places you wouldn't dream of... No. Not
this time. Sorry, Leo.

It's important to know first and foremost this movie isn't for
everyone... While my wife and I loved every second of it there are
however many slow scenes. If you aren't appreciating the movie for it's
artistic approach and build up's you might become bored. Now, bored
never set in as an emotion for myself while watching this movie. For
starters the action scenes alone are enough to get your adrenaline
going throughout the movie. The bear scene was almost too real, my wife
had to turn away, I nearly had to. If you want a movie that's worth
watching and not just something you can half heartily watch while
texting on your phone this is the film for you. If you need to be
easily entertained find something else, but if you appreciate the work
these people do, want to be on the edge of your seat at times, and
experience breathe taking scenery and emotion this movie is a great
bet.

"As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight." Hugh Glass
(DiCaprio) is leading a group of fur trappers through treacherous
territory with the help of his son. While out scouting he comes across
a pair of bear cubs, then the mother finds him. When he is found he is
barely alive. Not wanting to leave him behind the group attempts to
carry him to their destination but the mountains prove to be a
obstacle. Two men agree to stay behind with him, but for different
reasons. John Fitzgerald's (Hardy) greed gets the better of him and he
kills Glass's son and leaves him for dead. Glass fights back and is now
on a quest for revenge. There is only one thing to say about this
movie. WOW. Intense, nerve wracking, infuriating, hopeful and inspiring
all at the same time. DiCaprio is just incredible in this. He is
captivating even though he doesn't speak for a lot of it. This is a
movie I could just go on and on about but this is a film that just
needs to be viewed and not talked about. The only real negative thing I
can say about this is I don't think I could watch it again, it is just
really too intense for repeated viewings. When you watch it yourself
you will see what I mean. Overall, One of the best movies of the year
along with possibly the best performance of DiCaprio's career. He has
come a long way since Titanic. I give this an A.

Iñárritu is on fire. He now mastered the wonderful close camera
pictures, as well as the beauty of the nature and for me only one
director is as good in this - Steve McQueen (12 years a slave). The
Revenant is full of beautifully filmed camera angels and nature which
make the world believable. Iñárritu is also good in being different,
but got fully recognized for this just last year with the one camera
movie Birdman. Of course to have a great movie you also need a great
cast. Iñárritu worked and gave us mesmerizing roles from the likes of
Brad Pitt, Naomi Wats, Michael Kiton, Edward Norton and now Tom Hardy
and Leo D. Caprio. Both played their role perfectly and it would not be
unfair to give them both Oscars. So where is the problem? Unfortunately
in the story. A story that should have been about an forgotten culture,
a different time and a Mans will to survive, forgive and urge to
revenge has become a Hollywood messy, gore, superhuman journey filmed
for the mass audience.

Alejandro González Iñárritu cemented his place in the Hollywood film
scene last year with his tremendous undertaking Birdman or (The
Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). After sweeping the 2015 Oscars he did
not waste a moment and immediately dove into his next project, The
Revenant, which has garnered him an equal amount of love this awards
season.The simplest way to describe the film without spoiling any aspect of
the plot would be to say The Revenant is about one man's physical,
spiritual and emotional journey to survive against the unlikeliest of
circumstances. Set in the blisteringly cold woodlands in the 1820s, a
frontiersman named Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son Hawk
(Forrest Goodluck) lead an American expedition for animal pelts led by
Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). When they come under attack by
Native Americans, their mission is abruptly cut short as they flee for
the sake of saving their own lives. Barely far enough to rest, their
significantly smaller group suffers a painful blow and Glass is
viciously attacked by a tremendous bear. What follows are several
difficult decisions of will and morality at a time when the savagery of
men was a commonality.The Revenant is reminiscent of an unveiled western, removing the shiny
artificial nostalgia that clouds the truth of the time. Mark Smith and
Iñárritu's narrative is one you will recognize if you are a fan of
films of that era, the difference between the two is The Revenant does
not attempt to mislead audiences into believing in the blindly naïve
good guy versus bad guy dichotomy when it was inevitably a grey-er
time. So how can such a simple story stand apart so easily as the
prestigious front runner of the Academy Awards? The answer is equally
as simple, with amazing cinematography and superior techniques in
direction.Ask anyone what they thought of the film and their first comment will
be how beautiful the film is, this is true of someone who is 27 and
also of someone who is 95 (trust us on this one, we did the research).
They speak the truth; the landscape and cinematography are beautiful in
the purest form of the word. Have you ever been some place so breath
taking that you refused to take a picture because it wouldn't do it
justice? The Revenant captures that awe inspiring beauty that eludes so
many of us. Emmanuel Lubezki truly out did himself with this piece and
solidifies his position as one of the best cinematographers of the age.The direction is also impressive but not nearly as flawless, though it
is in its technique. Iñárritu's use of movement and his fluidity for
transitions and cuts is revolutionary, especially in the beginning of
the film. Alejandro has a vision through the camera lens and uses it as
a point of view for the on looker and as a complement to the
character's line of sight, yielding a complex and multidimensional
direction. And yet, despite these achievements, the film felt lacking
at its completion. We're aware of the secondary component of symbolism,
still, the film did not feel whole. Fantastic, wonderful, but missing
that intangible spark that forces a film to resonate with you and
leaves you blissfully satisfied. Further, while beautiful to watch, the
film was unnecessarily two and a half hours long when it truly did not
have to be.Watching the film, it is impossible to be so engaged in the film that
you forget you are watching a story played by actors, partially due to
the brutal natural conditions. The environment these actors endured are
some of the most extreme any artist could encounter, especially for
DiCaprio, but does that alone warrant the level of commendation the
film has been receiving? The actors do a fine job but their characters
are not unique and their performances not mind blowing, though Tom
Hardy's performance is certainly the stand out of the film. Yes, their
trust and faith in their director and to the material is admirable, as
is their commitment to braving these conditions for the sake of art but
where is the line drawn?Hopefully this criticism is not mistaken for disdain because the film
is a powerhouse, but it has very tangible weaknesses that detract from
the overall experience. Bloody and beautiful but an unremarkable
narrative except in its brutality.Please check out the Archon Cinema Reviews website for full reviews of
all the 2016 Oscar nominees.

There's a big Oscar buzz about this movie, which may have as much to do
with it having been a gruelling location shoot as to do with the
performances. Yes, DiCaprio is in terrific form, but so is Tom Hardy as
the nastiest of the trappers, all of whom communicate mostly in grunts
and mumbles. This film has the least intelligible dialogue since
BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The real stars are the director and cinematographer. The landscape
plays the kind of dominating role that it always did in a David Lean
movie. Alejandro Inarritu is perhaps Lean's true heir. And the film is
beautifully scored. Soaring music and lingering snowscapes: pure David
Lean. Glass's visions of his murdered native American wife (and son)
provide poignant moments and provide a welcome contrast to the violent
scenes which have the full-on shock of a body-horror flick.For me the story is told a little (maybe a lot) too slowly, making this
a beautiful, yes, but, oh dear, a very long movie (2 hours 36). There
have been quite a few 'Survival' pictures over the years (DELIVERANCE,
CAST AWAY, etc. etc.) and now we see Survival documentaries on TV all
the time. The movie I found myself comparing this to was THE LAST OF
THE MOHICANS, which had many of the same elements - frontiersmen,
'friendly' as well as hostile Indians, battles against the French -
together with an epic love-story, great music and great photography.
What THE REVENANT crucially lacks is pace (and clear diction).

This is a terrific film but I do agree with the reviewer who said it's
one of the best films they will never see twice. It's an epic: a
remarkably compelling film as we follow Leo through his battle for
survival to ultimate revenge. It's the sort of film they don't really
make any more. But they just did.There are some amusingly gory scenes. The bear attack is brilliantly
done but the scene which out-ranked it for disgust was when he climbed
inside the horse. Well, if it was life or death you would, wouldn't
you?The cinematography is just astonishing. Simple as that. It's stunning.My only real criticism is that it's so hard to hear a lot of the words.
The mumbling is on a level never before encountered. There are two stand-out performances. Leo is, of course, brilliant. But
so is Tom Hardy. It's difficult to choose between them for sheer
brilliance.

The story of The Revenant is pretty straightforward. A frontiersman,
Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is acting as guide to a group of
fur-trappers, is attacked and seriously injured by a bear. The group's
leader, Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson), decides to leave Glass to
either recover or die while the rest of the party continue their
journey to a distant outpost.Glass is left in the care of a cynical trapper, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy),
an inexperienced youngster, Jim, and Glass's own half-breed son, Hawk.
After the main party's departure, Fitzgerald decides to finish Glass
off but Hawk tries to stop him. In the ensuing struggle Hawk is killed.
Fitzgerald then persuades Jim that Glass is dying and that they must
abandon him for fear of Indian attack. They leave and eventually reach
the outpost where they are reunited with Henry, telling him -
untruthfully - they left after Glass had died.Unbeknown to them, Glass gradually recovers from his terrible wounds
and embarks on his quest for revenge on those who murdered his son and
left Glass himself to die. Glass has become the 'revenant', one who
'returns from the dead.' Set in the early 19th century amid the rivers and mountains of a wintry
Montana, this tale of wrongs and revenge is fairly straightforward. But
it is as much a story of survival in a brutal world in which violent
death is a familiar prospect for human and animal alike. Hence we
witness several graphically depicted scenes of bloody violence, the
bear attack being one of the most gruesome and terrifyingly convincing.
Here nature is 'red in tooth and claw', the spectre of Jack London (The
Call of the Wild, To Build a Fire, etc.) hanging over the entire
proceedings.What lifts this movie out of the ordinary is Emmanuel Lubezki's superb
cinematography which draws us into every scene. The mountain landscape
in all its bleak wintry majesty resonates perfectly with the
kill-or-die ethos of the living creatures that struggle to live there.
Yet the story is laced with moments of spirituality and hints of
transcendence; Glass has visions of his dead wife and lingering skyward
shots of silent towering trees point us to whatever - if anything -
that lies above and beyond.If you look too closely at this tale you see that Glass is an
improbably durable man, surviving what in reality would be impossible
circumstances. But so spell-binding is the combined effects of the
visuals, the music and the acting that we willingly suspend our
disbelief, at least until we emerge from the movie theatre and return
to the reality of daily life.Leonardo DiCaprio is little short of magnificent as Glass, ably
supported by Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson. Both DiCaprio and the
director, Alejandro Inarritu, look well-deserving of awards for this
stunningly atmospheric movie. Recommended - but be prepared for blood
and guts! Viewed at HOME (successor to The Cornerhouse), Manchester, UK, 17th
January 2016.

Alejandro G. Iñárritu's film serves up a chilly tale of retribution and
revenge. Apparently filmed in Argentina and Alberta, the climate within
which the protagonists rage is as cold as the tale they inhabit. Frozen
wastes never looked so beautiful. Icy waterfalls never so magical. The
cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki) astounds with almost every scene full
of beauty and wonder. In some ways, it's like a Malick movie. Nature is given a canvas on
which to paint it's own image and the effect is outstanding. However,
it also has a compelling narrative, suspending our disbelief in the
telling. It's only afterwards you start to wonder why a fish would be
eaten raw when there is a fire just feet away? How did he fire his
pistol without reloading it? There are further flaws, but suspend our
disbelief it does. The sheer majesty of the film over-rides such
quibbles as you become immersed in it's scale and wonder.The performances are raw and compelling. This is nature by tooth and
claw. Leonardo DiCaprio throws himself into every scene with savage
gusto, convincing us of his pain and suffering. Yet his commitment is
matched by those around him. Tom Hardy impresses as John Fitzgerald,
giving his character a humanity lesser actors would never have found,
and Domhnall Gleeson is excellent as Captain Andrew Henry. The rest of
the support cast are exemplary too.Flawed it may be, but it's a cinematic experience to be savoured. Don't
miss it. Enjoy it and immerse yourself in it's drama. Let the film work
it's magic and you'll not regret it.

I'm going to keep this relatively short, but if you haven't seen this
movie, go see it. It is one of the greatest odes to nature I have seen,
and makes you think twice about human impact on it and each other.The scenes in this movie are long and beautifully shot, though
occasionally they are drug out a tad too long. However, you can sense
the characters' emotions, not just through the fantastic acting on
behalf of DiCaprio and Hardy, but also through the cinematography. It
made for realistic and thrilling set-piece moments, putting me on the
edge of my seat. One of my fellow theater-goers even screamed during
one (non-scary) scene.You've probably heard of the bear attack, and it is as (I don't know if
'good' is the right term, but I can't think of another way to say it)
good as they say. I felt genuine fear for Glass, and cringed during his
pain. It was scary, tense, and worked well to invoke a feeling of
terror, more than I feel in a lot of modern horror movies.One of my only complaints with the movie is that, although they tried
to patch it, and it was no fault of him, Hardy's character Fitzgerald
seemed a tad too 'moustache-twirling' to be realistic. It wasn't over
the top, but it was noticeable in some scenes.All in all, it was a good, if overlong movie, and one of the best I've
seen in the past year. Go see it; you won't be disappointed.

The film is such an experience that you can almost feel the mud under
your feet, sense the chill on your skin and the danger that lurks
around every corner of an untamed wilderness in the 1820s. Leonardo
DiCaprio delivers a barnstorming performance as the embattled Glass,
whose quest for survival takes him on a Herzogian odyssey to the very
borders of life and death. The insights are not especially original
(the human spirit is strong!) but the execution is astounding. A
masterpiece. Should take Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best
Supporting Actor and Best Cinematography this year, next year and the
year after that.

The Revenant is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen
in my life. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu deserve endless praise
for this masterpiece. Every single shot in this film feels like it was
handled with the utmost care and attention to detail. At times I
couldn't even believe what I was watching was even possible to film
such as long action sequences with dozens of actors on screen, done
entirely in one take, with absolutely no cuts.The acting is perfect from nearly everyone. Leonardo DiCaprio is
definitely Oscar-worthy, as is Tom Hardy. They both give extremely
impressive performances. It's very impressive that Leo manages to pull
of such a great performance with such little dialogue. You can really
feel the emotion and pain in his acting. Even the supporting cast is
great, such as Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter. The Revenant contains some of the best cinematography these eyes have
ever seen. Absolutely breathtaking shots of beautiful wilderness, with
great use of natural lighting. The film definitely deserves an Oscar
for best cinematography. As far as flaws go, there aren't many. But the film was pretty slow in
a few parts and did drag on a bit. Also, there is a sub plot in the
film that I feel could have been explored more. But other than that,
The Revenant is a truly outstanding film and I plan on seeing it again
soon.9/10

A lot has been talked about this movie-about the harsh shooting
conditions ,people walking out the sets,etc.You will forget all about
once you see The Revenant.It is one of Leonardo Dicaprio's finest
movies in terms of acting. It may well land him what may be the first
of his many Oscars to come.The Revenant is a well portrayed survival
tale with astonishing cinematography that captures every moment with
perfection,the bear scene in particular.The story may seem to be a bit
bleak,but mind you,it isn't.The performance of the cast was top-notch.
Tom Hardy does pretty well but I felt Domhnall Gleeson was wasted.The
movie immerses you with its stunning visuals leaving traces of it in
your mind forever.The film is more like a tale of revenge,although for
some it may be a great experience in the wild.The film loses some of
its pace in the second half but overcomes it with its fine acting.The
background score is decent and the sound editing is pretty good too.All
in all, it is a breathtaking experience with delightful visuals.The
movie may well sweep the Oscars with its mammoth 12 nominations.If you
are free, rush to your nearest cinema hall and enjoy this movie.Believe
me this won't let you down.My ratingActing-10 Cinematography-10 Story-7 Direction-9

Just watched The RevenantI won't spoil the plot but will mention a few things... First off, Leonardo DiCaprio did an outstanding job in regards to
acting abilities. He was convincing, looked like death and needs an
award for his skills in this film. Secondly, the camera work was extremely impressive. The panoramic shots
show breathtaking scenery and were particularly well done. I was
inspired by the numerous times that they used cameras to circle around
Leonardo crawling across the snow thus creating an effect whereby you
could sense him (and his pain/suffering) at every angle. Noticeably, the sound effects were very chilling. The deep breathing
and groans filled with fear were realistic in every essence. The
clothing, hair and appearance of Leonardo were fantastically authentic.
All in all, the way that this film was put together cannot be flawed.
10/10 for all of the above.However, the gruesomeness of it made me close my eyes at least one
hundred times. (No exaggeration) For instance, there is a scene where
Leonardo is attacked by a bear which is incredibly graphic. He eats raw
fish straight from the river, vomits whilst chewing on carcass innards,
people get brutally murdered (hung/stabbed/shot) throughout and the
entire film is spewed with 'blood and guts'. The most intense scene is
arguably when his horse gets killed and due to the freezing weather
conditions, he carves out the guts, pulls them out with his bare hands
and sleeps inside the remains of the horse. As much as it was a well put together and wonderfully constructed film,
I genuinely found the graphic content to be a bit too grotesque. If you
are thinking of seeing this, make sure that you have a strong stomach.
Otherwise, thumbs up to Leonardo DiCaprio for a spectacular
performance. BUT be warned, you will be put off your popcorn!

There is nothing clean or pretty about The Revenant. Although it is
filled with gorgeous cinematography and seamless special effects, this
is a movie that makes you feel uncomfortable watching it. I don't think
I've ever seen such a realistic and riveting depiction of the pure
savagery of nature and what it can mentally, and physically do to man.
While much of the violence in this film is truly disturbing and
definitely got under my skin, at no point does it ever become
over-the-top or hard to believe. The violence in this film is different
than the violence in most, because it is shown in a very realistic and
natural way. The dialogue flows almost perfectly, which is part of what
contributed to the films overall realism. In some scenes there were
shaky camera shots, and mud and debris splashing the lens, which almost
made me feel like I was watching a found footage film. It was during
these moments when I felt like I was a part of the action, and that I
was in just as much danger of a bear attack or Indians arrows as the
characters on the screen. Part of what contributed to this high level
of realism, was an absolutely stunning performance by Dicaprio, perhaps
the best of his that I've seen. Somehow, while playing a role that has
so little dialogue, he was able to convey so much emotion and pain just
by using body language and facial expressions in what I can only
imagine was one of the toughest roles of his career. Tom Hardy also did
a great job of playing a character that was filled with so much hatred
and evil, but that also had a few moments of near redemption, short
lived as they may be. No film that I have seen this year has been as
gritty or as immersive as the Revenant, and very few films that I've
seen have ever been able to depict nature in such a savage, yet
realistic way. Finally, if Dicaprio doesn't get the Oscar for this, I
don't think he ever will.

Leonardo deCaprio like his role as Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004)
shows that he understands suffering well as a mountain man in Revenant.
Director Alejandro Inarritu incorporates a visceral cinematography
style as found in Saving Private Ryan (1998) into his own visual aspect
of men battling each other and seems to take advantage of the use of
sharp artistic images along with crisp sound effects that made Stanley
Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) so powerful and realistic. Using
haunting and powerful strains of music that at times echo Christopher
Nolan's Interstellar, Inarritu enhances the movie's lengthy edits
without dialogue. Revenant has many similarities to another stunning
survival movie, Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) and the epic western,
Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves that won best movie Oscars
twenty-five years ago.Yet unlike more personally and sustain intensity of the true to life
survival film, Kevin Macdonald's Touching the Void (2003, there are
plot weaknesses throughout the movie that mildly detract from the
movie's rhythm and authenticity. There is a scene beautifully shot from
high above a river and yet realistically the actual path to the river
seems impossibly difficult to navigate as that point in the movie.
There isn't any actual shot of the use of flint in making an actual
fire. And likely another in an extremely cold river would have died
within minutes of hypothermia. The death scene of a single Indian seems
unlikely when the white man survives nearby. And any person trying to
avoid being tracked is also a fool to walk in a visually stunning scene
in the middle of an open and barren now field. Finally it is unlikely a
manhunt as choreographed in The Revenant would have unfolded so
blatantly easily as it did.A major problem with this movie is how the director pushes the limits
of artistic presentation over the storyline. Sean Penn's survival
movie, Into The Wild (2007) is a good example where the director's
fantastic camera eye for beauty begins to transform into the foreground
of the movie's plot, and here in The Revenant falling into a tree scene
is one glaring example of overkill towards unbelievability. The last
problem with this movie is its ending which is overly extended and the
Indian women's character development and role in the movie is severely
minimized to the point that a most poignant redemption ending is lost
and overlooked.The Revenant deserves best acting, cinematographic awards, but it can't
quite offer the completeness for best movie.

An exciting trailer made 'The Revenant' a must-see film. The title
required a search to understand it's meaning. Neither is required
though before seeing this film. In fact viewers are best advised to
avoid both. The trailer does in fact show too much, thus diminishing
the level of suspense.The film opens with the familiar icon and music of 20th Century Fox.
The film itself is a Western, who's opening scenes shows a very wet and
heavily-forested landscape that seems primeval and virtually
unpopulated. White trappers are attacked by American Natives (formerly
known as Red Indians, though that is geographically incorrect), and in
attempting to escape, take a decision, that has momentous consequences.
There follows a struggle to survive in the harsh and grim environment,
which centres on one of the trappers.The star of the film is Leonardo DiCaprio who plays the role of Hugh
Glass. He is not just a trapper, but also appears to be a guide and
hunter too. He is accompanied by his son, Hawk, played by Native
American Forrest Goodluck, in a good debut performance. The son of
white man Glass and a Red Indian mother, his character is thus a half-
caste, and as such, viewed as alien by others. This harsh racist view
of 'the savage' is shown well throughout the film, but American Natives
themselves play several important roles within the film itself. One in
particular, plays a role that will be easily recognized by those
familiar with classic Westerns.Some clever use of dreams and memories give some back-story, but not
enough. Interjected, like scenes from the Sopranos, they are surreal
and thus take you out of the picture somewhat. More sadly, they never
give the back-story as to the circumstances of Hugh Glass meeting an
Indian woman and them then having a child. Trapper Glass has a story of
wanting to escape civilization and enjoy the silence of the wilderness.
Sadly we do not experience it, because the other flaw in the film is
the constant insertion of background music. Some, seems to fit in with
the time-period appropriately, but there is far too much of lots of
other music. More silence, as people trudged through the snow or trees
split in the cold, and thus those sounds being caught, would have been
better. However, these two drawbacks, should not detract from what is a
masterful piece of film-making by Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.
From the earliest scenes we have innovative camera shots that pull us
into the movie. The camera is used to present some great POV for us in
some early fighting scenes, that really give us the effect of being
there during the fight. This also continues in later parts of the film.
Likewise, we can have the camera turning to show a character isolated
in the wilderness, though never blurring as happens in so many other
films, nor making us giddy either. There are also some very long
tracking scenes, as well as some innovative filming from ground-level
too. All-in-all, Director Alejandro Inarritu gives us a master-class in
filming.It should be said that the cast and crew of the movie were filming in
very inhospitable locations for months. Conditions must have been very
harsh, and all concerned should be very proud of the commitment and
dedication required to do this. Leonardo DiCaprio, in particular should
be applauded. He is in virtually every scene, thus his workload, and
suffering, must have been more than that of the other thespians.Playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, after he persuaded him to read the
screenplay, is British actor Tom Hardy. Fresh from showing his acting
talents playing both of the Kray Twins in 'Legend' (2015), here in 'The
Revenant', he plays a rough tough experienced trapper. His 2012 outing
as a hillbilly moonshiner in 'Lawless' showed his ability to
authentically convince as an American, which he does again here in this
film. Captain Henry, the nominal leader of the trappers, is played by
Domhnall Gleeson. His accent was good and he convinced in his role. In
2015 he had another serious role in 'Ex Machina', much different from
his role in the rom-com 'About Time' made in 2013. British actor Will
Poulter also did a comedy in 2013, 'We're the Millers', here in 'The
Revenant' he too plays his part with distinction. A supporting-part
that is a spot bigger and meatier than Domhnall Gleeson's, though both
are good.There is a clear intent to portray Native Americans authentically as
well as sympathetically, thus we have use of subtitles for Pawnee as
well as French, although the majority of the film is in English. We are perhaps now seeing a revival of the 'Western' genre, after a
long gap. 2014 saw a good and also gritty cowboy film called 'The
Salvation'. 'The Revenant' is interesting because it shows an era, the
era of the fur-trapper, that is an earlier era, and one that is rarely
dealt with in the Western genre.'The Revenant' has to be considered one of the finest pieces of film-
making yet, both for cast and crew. The dedication required for filming
in the harsh conditions, as well as the resultant piece of work, make
it unrivaled. 8/10.

Based, more or less, on the true (legendary) exploits of mountain man
Hugo Glass, this film is location filming at its best. The
cinematography is gorgeous and should be a strong candidate for an
Oscar in that category. Likewise, Leonardo DiCaprio should be a leader
for the award as well. However, I believe Leonardo's nomination came
from the absolutely physical nature of the film and what he had to go
through to get the character to the screen.The story of Glass was told in another motion picture some years ago
(1971), in 'Man in the Wilderness' staring Richard Harris in the
feature role. Both films depict Glass as a guide, trapper and westerner
in the early Northwestern U.S. Glass is attacked by a bear, found by
his comrades and left for dead because his wounds were so severe.
That's my plot spoiler, sorry.Both films are rugged, frank and brutal and Revenant is even more so
than its predecessor. The violence depicted follows the recent trend of
stark realism in films. Director Alejandro G. Iñárritu pulls no punches
and delivers the action to the point of putting you in the picture. Be
prepared. I don't think children should see this film but it is very,
very good. It will run a tight race for best picture of 2015.

Despite previous efforts in 'The Wolf of Wall Street', 'What's Eating
Gilbert Grape', 'The Departed' and 'Titanic', just to name a few,
Leonardo DiCaprio is still awaiting his first academy award. BUT, after
watching 'The Revenant', you will realise that the wait is finally
over! After getting mauled by a bear and eventually rising from the
dead, poor Leo embarks on a conquest across the freezing landscape in a
story governed by the idea of revenge. The film also explores, rather
cleverly, many different themes including the wind, the trees and their
deep roots. Asides the brilliant acting performances of Leonardo
DiCaprio and also Tom Hardy who definitely deserves his nomination for
best Supporting Actor, the visuals in this film are top class, with the
snowy mountains providing a fierce backdrop for the film itself.
However, I do not believe this film is as good as the acting. The story
itself, and the dialogue (of which there is very little) was not
Oscar-worthy. The cinematography on the other hand is as good as it
gets with the bear-attack being as real and unbearable as possibly
imaginable. The struggles of life for Hugh Glass (Leo) are very well
portrayed as his survival skills are put to the absolute limit.
Overall, a decent-good film with lots of realistic violence and two
superb acting performances. However, if you came to the cinema to
escape the January cold, you'd be very, very wrong.7.0/10

This is a well thought out and produced movie. It has some great scenic
vistas and the surround sound matches the scenery. Think of Jack
London's Call of the Wild here, though this film is so much more.The cast does great in this film, though I honestly think because of
the way the script is structured and the outdoor scenes are so well
done, the actors are really not as important here. The drama and the
script are, and it is all superb.The story line is followed well and the action sequences are all really
well done. Particularly the bear mauling the main character is
amazingly portrayed. I do wonder how faithful to the book it is a I
have not read this one yet. Leonardo DiCaprio is superb, his best role yet. The film is set in
French Canadian Northern Territory, though the time of it might
actually be during the French and Indian war. The exact time is not
important as is really not made clear, as a great drama is not about
when but is about the action.There is some French spoken which makes for subtitles and some sub-
titles for the Native American spoken by the Native Americans as well.
The main speaking in English in the film is done by the guy who would
be classified as the bad guy in this. There is only one woman, a Native
American, in the main cast and she is superb as well.This film is getting deserved nominations and wins in the Awards
Categories, and at least there is a minority in this film. The scenic
vistas and sound should win some awards too. Very enjoyable dramatic
effort by everyone involved. There is some R Rated materials and some
depictions of life in the wild that are pretty raw as a warning for
viewers who do not like that. That material is not the central theme
here. Very good film, indeed.

I went into this movie a bit skeptical. The story sounded pretty dumb,
and I hoped that there would be more to it. Luckily, there was, and I
was very impressed. The Revenant had a plot that sounded like it could be awesome, but when
I thought about it it sounded dumb. A man, Hugh Glass, is mauled by a
bear and left for dead by his hunting party, then wakes up to seek
revenge on them. Thankfully, that wasn't the only thing. I won't say
anymore to avoid spoilers, but there's a lot more to it than that. You
never really know what Glass is trying to accomplish though until the
very end, which is actually kind of interesting. He's alone for the
majority of the movie, so he has no reason to state his plans to
anyone, including himself. He just has his thoughts, which we never
hear. The characters are pretty good too. Despite DiCaprio not having too
many lines his acting was quite good, and you actually kind of feel for
his character at the end. You want him to succeed, which I feel a
little bad about (wanting him to kill someone). Tom Hardy's character,
Fitzgerald, was great too. Having more actual lines, I felt like he was
better developed. I barely recognized him either, his costume and
accent were fantastic. In short, the characters and acting were great. There are a few things that make this movie stand out particularly, one
of those being the cinematography. The sights are absolutely stunning,
and it's really amazing that most of the movie was practical effects.
It wasn't just a bunch of dudes running around a green screen, they
were running around in the freezing cold. The movie is always
incredibly beautiful to look at. It also features a handful of long
shots without cuts, which is really impressive. Entire battle scenes
were sometimes made up of a single shot. The movie is very solid for the first 2 hours, but the last 40 minutes
are astounding. Considering how the movie had gone thus far and its
based off true events, I wasn't actually sure what the outcome would
be, and I was on the edge of my seat for the entire thing. Thankfully,
the ending was not disappointing, it was easily one of the best
climaxes I've ever seen. Overall The Revenant is stunning. With a solid plot, great characters,
great acting, fantastic cinematography, and a fantastic climax, it's
easily one of the the best movies of 2015. Unfortunately the movie took
a little while to get going, but maybe that was just because I was
tired when I started it. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing this
again, and I would highly recommend anyone to check this out.

I must be one of the few who watched Man in the Wilderness a 1971 film
starring a proper hard-man in the form of actor Richard Harris (some
might recall a film A Man called Horse), loosely based on the life of
Hugh Glass, the same character of The Revenant, main contender for
several Oscars 2016, starring pretty-boy, ... okay it's now more
pretty-man Leonardo di Caprio. Curious to see how Signore Di Caprio
would handle being a truly believable frontier man, have to compliment
him with a huge "Bravo Signore" - a job well and truly well done. If he
doesn't nail the Oscar for best actor this time around, don't know what
other role will ever do it for him. Kudos to the Director and the
Cinematography, some of the best I've ever seen. It's at times an
uncomfortable viewing but never for one second did I find myself not
riveted by what was on the screen. Now all that is left to fully
appreciate The Revenant, I will just need to watch it when it's
released on Blu-Ray/DVD so I can press the sub-titles button so as to
finally get understand at least one word of Mr Edward Thomas Hardy's
dialogue and performance.

This is not a revenge movie but mainly a movie about the difficulties
about men living in unconfortable environments against the animals and
other men living there. It's pure nature, the man becames an animal
like the others. The plot is OK and consistent and there are at least 3 major changing
picks in the movie. The characters are well depicted and the actors
played a good role. I definitely appreciate this last Inarritu work. A plus for L. DiCaprio that now deserves the Academy award for best
male actor.Daniele

This screenplay was written by and for the self-aggrandizement of
Alejandro González Iñárritu. It is one of those films created by a
gifted director so he can show how gifted he is. A mere 2 1/2 hour
sequence of brilliantly shot, spectacularly beautiful, but essentially
meaningless scenes produced for use at virtually any film school.
Simply put, it's a "look what I can do" practice directing movie,with a
boring and unimaginative script, and wooden dialog. Oh, it also
provides sufficient enticement to Leo to guarantee him a nomination for
Best Actor. Under Goofs: The film should open with a disclaimer: Please
leave your critical thinking skills at the door, and pretend there is
no such thing as frost bite and hypothermia. Is it worth seeing?
Probably not. Just too contrived . . . and plot-less.

Leonardo Dicaprio.. wow, he has literally no competition this year, the
Oscar is practically in his hands and it is very well deserved. The
fact that this film is based on a true story truly amazes me. Once
again a reminder of why Dicaprio is my favourite actor of all time.He stars as Hugh Glass, a man who loses everything and is left for dead
by his own men after being mauled by a bear. The film played out very
differently to how i was expecting, for example scenes with Glass
aren't very dialogue based at all, but i really liked this. It gave a
better sense of emotion and let us relate to him in an almost eerie
way. We go on this journey with him and we feel isolated with him which
makes the film so compelling and reminds us that this is man who has
suffered through everything on the way. Tom Hardy also gives a really
good performance. We have seen him in a lot and each time he is very
different, this film is no exception. I really hated his character,
which made the performance so great. Even when he played villains such
as Bane i didn't feel such a villainous nature to the character, but
here he is such a horrible person that you cant help but get sucked in
to the performance he gives.Making this film itself must have been a huge challenge. I heard a lot
of crew left the project and i can see why. Also, the film is very
gritty and realistic meaning there are scenes that are flat out hard to
watch. The initial scene with the bear that i mentioned is so intense
and it doesn't stop there. The film is slow, but not in a boring way.
It is slow because its a character study on Glass' part and the amazing
performance we get makes it the compelling type of slow. But when there
is an intense scene, all notches are turned up 100% and we do not know
where things are going to be heading. I never actually read up on the
story itself, but that meant i was on the edge rooting for his survival
the whole time and not knowing how things would end. The way things do
end though are so clever and satisfying that it was worth the wait to
see.As the Oscars approach i have to say, i see this film getting a huge
number of them. Dicaprio's long overdue Oscar is in the bag and between
Tom Hardy and Sylvester Stallone there is a heated competition. A
heartbreaking at times, heartpounding at times type of film that is one
of the best in a long time. The hard work put into this film was well
worth it in the end.

A simpler review!!! I am a picky movie goer these days. I only see
movies that review great by the majority. Went and saw this movie last
night. Theater was filled. I loved this movie. Great scenery and story
line. The movie was long, but kept me at the edge of the seat and the
time went by fast. If you like westerns, adventure and survival
movies/show, you should love this movie. Some people compared this
movie to Jeremiah Johnson = not exactly. It has a little comparison to
Jeremiah Johnson, a little Dances with Wolves and a lot of Revenants in
survival type situation. If you do not like gore, than you most likely
will not like this movie. Most (if not all) bad reviews, start off with
saying the gore did it for them. Most of the gore has to do with animal
blood and guts. If you are an animal lover, the gore and cruelty will
probably turn you off and the movie will then seem long and drawn out.
If you do not like space movies, are you going to like Star Wars!?! If
you are a vegan, are you going to like survivalist meat eating
movies!?! If you like love stories only, are you going to like Face Off
or the Die Hard movie!?! Get the picture, lol! I felt the $12 I spent,
was well worth seeing this in the theater. P.S. I have not seen the new
Star Wars yet (I liked the old Star Wars, but hated the last 3 new
one's)and might not see it in the theater, as reviews are comparing it
to the last 3 (actually #4), so for me, why waste $12 and not like it.

. . . as Robert Redford never had to crawl a thousand miles with a
broken leg as the title character of that Western that set the standard
for gutty realism and wintertime survival in the 1900s. Apparently,
Oscar-nominated REVENANT director A.G. Inarritu has decided that his
best chance for back-to-back wins (after last year's over-rated
BIRDMAN, which stole the golden statuette from WHIPLASH) is to take a
page out of Alfonso Cuaron's Oscar-winning Playbook for GRAVITY, as he
recycles pretty much the same plot in an attempt to give Hispanic
"Magic Realism" (known as "Fantasy" to those who speak American) a
clean sweep of top awards during the past three popularity contests.
Sure, GRAVITY takes place this century in Outer Space and THE REVENANT
is set in the 1800s down here on Earth. But these are just superficial
differences, when you consider the core of each plot. Both Sandra
Bullock and Leo DiCaprio keep seeing Dead People, a hallmark of Magic
Realism. They both face a personal survival challenge, though not much
is on the line for either one of them beyond their own life. Bullock
and DiCaprio's characters both get help from unexpected foreign
sources, as implausible serendipity substitutes for adult logic in
Magic Realism. But Hispanic Fantasy is trendy with the Hollywood
"Elites" currently, and anything that smacks of Real Life and has
something important to say about today's world (think THE HATEFUL EIGHT
and TRUMBO) gets the Stink Eye from Tinseltown.

Alejandro González Iñárritu is a special kind of director. As a fan of
Birdman, I expected the direction of this film visually would also be
brilliant. My expectations were beyond met. As far as technicalities
go, The Revenant is pretty much a masterpiece. The choice for natural
lighting and nice blend of CGI and practical special effects make for
an entertaining watch. Additionally, the close-up cinematography gets
into the action most often for constant tension. The score variation is
small and subtle, but tense whenever used. And to top it off,
Iñárritu's obsession with nature shots make you enjoy staring at
running water and cloudy skies.As far as the plot goes, it's simple. A man left for dead has to hunt
down the man who betrayed him. You'll see Glass get beat up by man and
nature endlessly, redefining gritty in terms of modern cinema. Aside
from Hardy's hard-but-audible mumble speech throughout the film, the
acting is spot on and realistic. I'm sure half the dialogue is
breathing honestly, but Revenant doesn't fall short in speech either.
To be honest, my only pet peeve with this film is the drawn-out length
and additional shots that could have easily been left out the film. It
all looks so beautiful, but I'm sure at least 20 minutes or more
could've been cut without changing the story or ruining pace. All in
all, the length doesn't pose a huge issue considering Revenant
succeeding on all other aspects.The concept is so damn simple, yet the end product itself justifies its
budget. The Revenant is no masterpiece or life-changing film but it's
worth the watch.

I don't want to spoil this for anyone out there but this great movie
with an Oscar worthy performance by Leonardo DiCaprio is a remake and I
find it a bit odd that I am perhaps the first one to bring this up.
Richard Harris played the lead role in the 1971 picture "Man in the
Wilderness" which I saw many years ago. When The Revenant came out, my
first thought was...Oh boy, yet another Hollywood remake. The story in
the original version also takes place in the early 1800's and unfolds
basically the same way. The one thing that stuck to me in the older
version was the similar yet still frightening bear attack on the fur
trapper guide. Whatever...this is still a very good movie REMAKE.

The powerful story of Hugh Glass's survival in the wilderness based on
Michale Punke's book of the same name was depicted beautifully by the
genius director Alejandro Inarritu and the cinematography of Emmanuel
Lubezki. Leonardo Dicaprio does a convincing job as the tracker who
fell in love with a native woman and struggles to survive. Tom Hardy
does exceptionally well as the villain of this picture topping off a
great year of performances. Domhall Gleeson and other supporting actors
also do a great job.The shots are so beautiful with plenty of panoramic images of the
dazzling white wilderness. This movie drives home the idea that the
natural world is harsh and unforgiving. Any moment when a character
achieves sympathy from the viewer, they are immediately faced with
dangerous circumstances and often don't get it out alive. Dicaprio's
character Glass goes through an especially harsh time with a brutal
attack from a bear that continues on even after the uncomfortable level
has passed. The director did a great job showing Glass's recovery while
still escaping from a war party of Native Americans.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com

I have always been a fan of Korean revenge genre and nothing thus far
in Hollywood had come close to some of the offerings by Park Chan-
Wook. Until The Revenant! Interestingly, PCW was supposed to be first
choice to direct this movie. However, I believe Innaritu has outdone
him with this movie, and believe me its tough to out-do the master when
it comes to revenge. A lot will be and has been written about the
cinematography, the locations and Di Caprio's intense performance.
However, for me the real winner was the camera-work particularly in the
action scenes. It was some of the most innovative work I have seen in a
while, and none of the shaky camera stuff which seemed to be the holy
grail of out-of-the-box thinking thus far. Every scene seemed so
visceral and real, was like having a 4D effect in a 2D movie. Might
seem like an exaggeration, but its not. Revenge, nature and the human
spirit are the basic ingredients of the plot and really that's all you
need to know about that. Just go with a strong stomach and revel in
what will be a riveting 2 and a half hours.

The Revenant is one of those movies that you simply must watch at the
cinema. If Leonardo doesn't win an Oscar for his awe-inspiring
performance, I really don't know what will win him one.First, I want to give Alejandro González Iñárritu props for pulling off
some of the best shots I've ever seen. Almost every shot was carefully
thought about and looked absolutely stunning, and Alejandro managed to
picture the look of early 19th century America perfectly, and the
nature of the film allowed for so many shots which were more than
pleasing to the eye. I highly doubt anyone would have done a better job
at directing such an ambitious film than Alejandro, so I say he did
incredible work.Leonardo DiCaprio did a phenomenal job at portraying a vengeful man
with nothing but survival and revenge at mind, who was savagely mauled
to the brink of death by a grizzly. In Hollywood there aren't many
actors I would say rival Leonardo when it comes to putting heart and
soul into movies, and Leonardo managed to hold his position as one of
the best actors in history. The Revenant starts off with Leonardo being
a bad ass hunter and skilled tracker, and after the incident with the
bear, it transforms into more of a survival film with Leonardo's
character 'Hugh Glass' going above and beyond to get revenge on Tom
Hardy's character 'John Fitzgerald'. Tom played a character who's sole
purpose is to survive and lead a prosperous life perfectly. Fitzgerald
wasn't much of a team player and more often than not prioritised his
life over others, leading to him being portrayed as the big bad of this
movie. However, he pulls it off superbly. The final character I want to
mention is Domhnall Gleeson's 'Captain Andrew Henry'. Although he
wasn't the most fleshed out and interesting individual, he did a great
job at being the good cop of the film. Without his friendliness and
sense of companionship, I feel the movie wouldn't have been as
riveting. Since most of this film revolves around action sequences, tension and
characters, as well as incredible shots, the pace was a tiny bit off.
The first 20 minutes or so consists of tension and action and then it
drops off up until the bear attack. From that point on the pacing
seemed to slow down and at some times I wasn't as engaged in the story
as I had hoped. However keeping viewers constantly engaged would have
been near impossible to accomplish since the movie was a whopping 156
minutes long. Nevertheless, the movie was outstanding and managed to do
a good job of keeping viewers interested.Overall, 'The Revenant' is a must see in the cinema, with absolutely
jaw dropping shots, landscape and environment, as well as incredible
acting my Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Go and watch it as soon as
you can.

The Oscar nominations for 2016 have just been announced and whilst
there has been what is almost the expected controversy about the lack
of diversity amongst the nominees, one thing has not been grumbled
about is that this low-down and gritty western from the director of
last year's big winner Birdman has come out on top with 12 nominations
including, Best Picture and Director.It might win them again, if the otherwise dull but pretty Carol doesn't
scoop them (unaccountably, this is the film of the year for almost all
critics. Am I missing something? Did anything transpire in it?!).In terms of the depiction of suffering and hardship DiCaprio's fur
trapper undergoes and Iñárritu's masterful handling of camera and
pacing, this is as awesome as the unyielding American and Canadian
landscapes it is set in.DiCaprio himself may win too, as he is up for Best Actor for his 'grey
teeth and spittle' performance. "I ain't afraid to die anymore. I done
that already" he intones, perfectly matching his grizzled character,
from greasy hair down to his crippled feet.Also nominated is Hardy as his murderous colleague. It's a wordier and
stronger performance, showing his increasing confidence at quietly
upstaging the bigger star.See the full review: http://ow.ly/X8YyZ

Honestly, the movie is probably over-hyped. It's basically a story
about loss, survival, and revenge. The survival part, the middle of the
movie, is very long and slow moving. I was interested the entire time,
but still found myself almost dozing off. It was not boring, just slow.
The acting was good; I could understand how some may join the bandwagon
and think the acting was great. However, I don't think the acting was
even close to last years performance by Bradley Cooper in American
Sniper. There is also no great idea, concept, or emotion to be taken
from the movie either, as it is simply a revenge movie. My thoughts
upon leaving the theater is how brutal, and yet beautiful, frontier
live in the Dakotas was. If you have a desire to see this movie, then
the movie theater is definitely the way to go. Don't wait for DVD. The
movie is visually stunning on the big screen, and it should easily win
an Oscar for cinematography, costume design, and visual effects.
Hunters or outdoors-men may enjoy the movie just for the magnificent
scenery. Women might not enjoy the movie due to the honest brutality of
the movie. Leave the kids at home; they will be bored stiff in the
middle of the movie. I don't know if this is a movie that I would watch
again. By the end of the movie, the viewer just does not experience a
whole range of emotions. Anguish, survival, and revenge are about the
extent of the emotions, and they're all similar. That's the whole range
of emotions experienced. Is the movie an action, a drama, or a western?
I don't think that can be answered either. Compare this to my favorite
drama in the past couple of years, The Judge. I knew it was a drama,
and I experienced pain, love, loss, laughter, kinship, justice, and
understanding; all in one great flick.

I liked this film because LDC stated afterwards that "it's about time
that Indigenous People get the fair treatment they deserve" .. or
something along those lines.I made reference to when Robert Redford starred in Jeremiah Johnson
because Redford also played the role of the mountain man just like LDC
did in this film except that this film had more realistic looking
scenes. But personally I don't think LDC should have starred in this
film at all because he just doesn't have that historical mountain man
look. In fact, I think someone like Kevin Costner should have been
given the role of Hugh Glass because of his previous role in 'Dances
with Wolves'. Costner's role in the 1990 film would have been
synonymous with the role of Hugh Glass. This was NOT the kind of film
where LDC would be in. I mean this isn't his kind of role: the
outdoorsy kind of actor where you would normally see him. Some actors
fit in perfectly with their roles but with LDC should NOT have been
contacted by the other film crew to play the part. Some will agree with
that one. I found this film to be about survival ... how we all have to survive
throughout life. It was a perfect way to convey the message through
this film in a historical setting based on the factual account on Hugh
Glass's struggle to survive in such harsh natural environments. I've
always been a huge fan of films based on historical accounts where
Native Indigenous People are involved.Anyways... I gave this one a 7 out of 10.

After winning 3 major Oscars last year, it did not take writer and
director Alejandro González Iñárritu to come up with his next work that
garners major awards attention. Recently, he won Best Drama Movie and
Best Director at the Golden Globes for "The Revenant". Also it looks
like this is finally the movie that gives Leonardo DiCaprio his first
Academy Award. It is a pretty long film, runs for over 150 minutes and
takes place in snowy America. The first parts of the film show us a
group of fur traders. When the central character is attacked by a bear,
they decide to leave him back and the film is basically split into two
different parts: Glass' fight for survival and what the other gang
members are doing at the same time. These include Tom Hardy's
character, the main antagonist. I found him interesting to watch too.
It becomes obvious how he is not only ruthless and greedy, but also how
he is somewhat of an outsider in the group with the other people mostly
admiring Glass for his perseverance. Also the scene when the young guy
threatens him with his gun is pretty memorable. After Fitzgerald
realizes the gun won't fire and it was never his intention to kill him,
he lets him live too. A multi-layered character. Not just pure evil.Lets take a look at DiCaprio now. It is basically a 100% physical
performance, almost non-verbal. He speaks only very few words in this
film, occasionally in Indian. His scene with the bear mauling him is
certainly among the most memorable of the cinema year 2015. Very tough
to watch, yet it's equally difficult to look away. His scenes with his
Indian pal or the Native American references in this film could have
been better in my opinion and did not really make an emotional impact
on me. Nonetheless, the people behind this film succeeded with the
really difficult task of making a film this long that does not (or
almost never) drag at all. It is also one of these films that you
should really watch on the big screen if you have the opportunity. The
cold, bare, mean snowy landscapes make this very atmospheric. Will
Emmanuel Lubezki win a third Oscar in a row for his work here? It
certainly seems a possibility right now. Even if I would not rank this
movie among the very best of 2015 for me, it was still a thrilling
watch for the most part and DiCaprio's performance alone makes it worth
the watch. Also always nice to see Domhnall Gleeson such a good guy
like he does in here. I like him as an actor. Back to Leo, the last
shot on his face was truly memorable when we see him look right at the
camera. Very very haunting. Go check it out.

There is no doubt for me that Leonardo DiCaprio will finally embrace
his "deserved a long time ago" Oscar statuette. Last night's Golden
Globe win is the best proof for that.But what about the Bear the Magnificent, mauling Hugh Glass (Leo's role
name) to protect her cubs?I was amazed by the fact that bear was actually a VFX project developed
by the mighty ILM team. I thought it was a real Grizzly dude, well
trained bear playing side by side with Leo and stunts.ILM used its Zeno pipeline for simulation, Maya for animation and
Pixar's RenderMan for rendering.Bravo to all the team that created this masterpiece simulated-
animation. They, too, deserve a VFX Oscar this year.

Alejandro González Iñárritu returns to his director's helm after his
Oscar winning Birdman. Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Domhnall
Gleeson play a group of frontiersman on a fur trapping expedition that
ends in disaster.The plot of this film was based on the folk tale of Hugh Glass, a
trapper who was left for dead and seeks out those who left him behind.
The film itself is loosely based on that story, but DiCaprio does an
amazing job portraying him. I could feel the suffering this man went
through along his journey, and having been lost in the woods before, I
certainly could empathize with the character. The actors are phenomenal
and portray their motivations very well. Iñárritu, using what he has
learned in previous films, does well in bringing this story to life. I
was certainly impressed with his ability to blend his infamous 'Long
Take' style in a few action packed scenes, and balance them into the
visual story line. But it was the overall storytelling that I enjoyed.There were a few things I noticed that didn't really add up, but I try
to suspend any disbelief in the errors that were made in the plot. I
don't want to ruin the film for those who haven't seen it, but there is
a hole or two that can't go unnoticed. However the overall story, stark
landscapes, and the portrayal of the actors in this film are all
phenomenal.Personally I think people hold Iñárritu to a higher standard of film
making because of his previous Oscar wins, and therefore rated it less
than Birdman, but I enjoyed this movie so much more.8/10

Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit in the
comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch protagonists
suffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us can't really
comprehend. Too often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even
worse, false. We're smart enough to "see the strings" being pulled, and
the actor and set never fades away into the character and condition.
What's remarkable about Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu's "The Revenant" is
how effectively it transports us to another time and place, while
always maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art. You don't just
watch "The Revenant," you experience it. You walk out of it exhausted,
impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking and a little more
grateful for the creature comforts of your life.After Long Gap,Leonardo DiCaorio Acted In this film. He looks
completely Different. Totally different story. we can see best action
from Leonardo and Tom Hardy. BGM looks familiar. heard somewhere.
Moreover, this movie is completely relations based. And also this movie
got, enough action sequences. Running human emotions based. overall..
its a unique story. hope, Leonardo will get Oscar with this film.

I will say that in had my reluctance seeing the movie and I am glad
that I got the chance to see the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hugh
glass who along with his son hawk are facing struggles with a fellow
Indian group. After a hunting incident with a bear that mauls Hugh and
leaves him In a state of near death, his fellow rival Fitzgerald feels
that it would be best to put Hugh out of misery feeling that his state
of near death would drag down the group, his plans are interfered when
Hugh son hawk witnesses the event and attempts to stop it, but ends up
getting killed. Being left for dead, Hugh vows revenge on Fitzgerald
for the death of his son and will stop at nothing to pursue his enemy.
I will say the music score and the performances of Leo and tom hardy
make the film worth watching as the film feels like one of those old
fashioned revenge stories.

This movie really touched my heart, I wasn't expecting much by what I
saw in the trailer. This is a rare thing that happened to me. Yes the
movie was almost perfect by my terms because it had a great drama plot,
great drama scenes and it gave you the adrenaline for the protagonist
that he was being chased by death. Fight scenes were also very good
especially the one with the bear, it was thrilling. Like they
saying...revenge is a dish best served cold and this movie is all about
that phrase and even more...The villain of the movie is in my top
villains in movies, he really made me hate him. I really don't have
words to say about this movie all I can say is that I recommend to
watch it because I think you will enjoy it.

Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who brought us the Academy Award
winning picture 'Birdman' brings us a powerful film inspired by true
events that took place in the l820s in snowy mountains of what is now
Montana and North Dakota. The Revenant tells the story of Northern
frontiersman Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) and his tribe
under the command of Andrew Henry (played by Domhall Gleeson) who
escape their village after devastating attack by the Native American
tribe leads to severe casualties. On their expedition towards the east,
Glass is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear, and is severely wounded.
With his party struggling to aid, the ruthless John Fitzgerald (played
by Tom Hardy) and Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter), under
Fitzgerald's orders, rob him and leave him for dead, while Fitzgerald
merciless murders his son in fear. Buried alive, Glass awakens from his
critical state and embarks on a journey cross-country on a search to
hunt down the men who betrayed him. Alejando Gonzalez Inarritu has some of the most lively styles of
filmmaking in recent years, and it really took audiences everywhere by
storm with his previous works. This film, sparkling with stunning
cinematography, stellar performances, and a fascinating direction;
stands a prime example of a director pushing for pure realism. The film
opens with the main character and his tribe as their village is
suddenly attacked by the Native American militia, and we watch as a
number of people are brutally injured and killed. This entire is bloody
and quite intense to watch. Nonetheless, what makes these opening ten
minutes compelling is the amazing camera-work by Emmanuel Lubezki. It
is done in such a fascinating way to where it pulls us right into the
action, and the heat of the bloodshed battle can be felt. The biggest
attention-grabber however, may the bear attack sequence which is
probably the most intense scene in the entire film. Complete with sound
editing, this scene consisting of Leonardo Dicaprio viciously fighting
off the bear as brutally claws and bites him, is shot in a way to make
it painful and cringe-inducing to watch. But the authenticity of the
scene is the real gem. Then the film ventures through the main
character's journey across the nation which I think is the biggest
weakspot of the story due to its slow pacing.This film stops at nothing to portray pure realism with such solid
camera-work, use of natural lighting and the captivating performances
by Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy. Dicaprio who's character has a
short amount of dialogue throughout the runtime, embraces a strong
performance through his facial expressions rather than stellar
dialogue. Then Tom Hardy is who plays John Fitzgerald who turns against
the main character is very mesmerizing in his role. From the beginning
the film, he immediately disappears into his character and gives a
performance that shines like gold. The performances are what redeems
the film from its slow pacing. There is little doubt that the film
struggles to sustain its 156 runtime with the its pacing, and at times,
can get a little tedious. Nevertheless, the realism of the action and
the story can be enough to grab your attention and hold on to it for
its entirety. The Revenant is definitely one of the best films of the year, and
demonstrates some of the best performances of this year as well.
Leonardo Dicaprio is great what maybe the performance of his career,
and just might finally land him his long awaited Oscar. The film is
very gripping, very realistic, and something everyone should look into.

well, good movie in the Iñarritu mood, but the story seems to not to
please everyone. Very good inerpretation of the actors (dicaprio and
tom hardy), it seems that finally they will win an Oscar of best actor
and best actor in supporting role. We can probably it will will the
best adpated argument.The soundtrack was awful and the special effects
was very bad to. There was sometimes the dicaprio seems to be superman,
for example when he falls of the mountin and when he gets the floor we
is intact, in the other hand we have the horse full of fractures and
wounds. Well, now we have to wait and see the others movies, who knows
this will be a a movie to recall...

The intensity of The Revenant can be tortuous at times, watching what
that poor man went through (the character AND the actor). DiCaprio
deserves Oscar consideration alone just for dedication to the hell he
endured to play the part. The cinematography was astounding as well.
Hauntingly beautiful, tragic, cruel...when a film can capture your
imagination, steal your soul, and take you on a powerful, provocative
journey, it deserves to be seen and recognized. Stories from the
American frontier are often romanticized, but this is no Dances With
Wolves... I recall thinking to myself, how did anyone ever survive in
those conditions? After I came home, I did a little research and
discovered that Hugh Glass was a real person who actually accomplished
some of what is described in the film, which was stunning. I wasn't
sure what to expect, and I would ask people to understand this film is
about imagery and emotion, not dialogue or music. There are many
layers, some of them subtle, all of them poignant. I was surprised by
the sound editing and effects, the music was used minimally in many
places, but effectively. I also particularly enjoyed the use of
language and breathing as a counterpoint to scenes as opposed to
music...we heard the sounds of life in that particular wilderness...
stark, bleak. Like the film. Thumbs way, way up. If you have any
inclination to see this film, it deserves to be viewed on the big
screen. Sit close, and prepare to be taken back in time to a place
where all you can rely on is whatever skills you have and survival
instincts you may posses.

I have been looking forward to this film for some time and I was not
disappointed! When I learned the movie was almost 2 hours and 40
minutes in length, I was concerned that the pace might be too slow. Not
the case! Certainly with the development of mostly the central
character, adequate time will need to be spent doing so, but the
majestic scenery and the thrilling sound score made the slow pace not
only tolerable, but enjoyable. DiCaprio continues to impress me with
the range of characters he is able to play. He is believably tough but
sensitive in many spots, too. The film gives respectful homage to
Native American culture, but does so in a guilt-free style that
truthfully depicts the early 1800's interactions between them and
Europeans. The film contains just enough CG to deliver parts of the
story line that could only be achieved using special effects, keeping
the ASPCA and animal lovers happy. Tom Hardy is someone you will love
to hate very quickly and he will be up for awards, too. I predict Leo
has finally earned his Oscar...well done.

Being one of the apparently very rare people that are not a huge fan of
Alejandro González Iñárritu's "Birdman", I at first considered not
watching his latest installment, but gladly I did! "The Revenant" is a suspenseful movie from its first second until its
last even though it might not have typical and expected action
sequences. The whole film is more of an alternative project and
deviates greatly from mediocre film making. The camera work is
fantastic and unique! It is especially impressive if you consider that
the whole movie was shot using only natural lightning! Especially the
images of the landscapes are tremendously beautiful! Furthermore, the
performances were outstanding! Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hugh Glass,
was really good and convincing. As a viewer you cannot help but feel
pity but also admiration for Glass! It is so unbelievable that those
events really transpired! But to me, the real scene stealer was Tom
Hardy, whose character is closely linked to Glass'suffering! Concerning
the plot it takes some time until it is clear what kind of movie it
really is and it may leave some people disappointed because in the end
there is not that much substance to it and some scenes just felt a
little bit unnecessary. But that really is nitpicking and does not
annoy during watching just when reflecting afterwards! This movie was
also surprisingly gory which I did not expect going into it! The
trailer already gives hints to that but there really is a lot of blood
and gore in this film though it really adds to the tone of the movie
and as a special make up enthusiast I have to say it is very well done
and impressed me greatly! In general, there is some stuff in this film
I really would like to know how they achieved it (specially a certain
bear scene). Additionally the score is beautifully fitting! Most of the
time it is very calm but the typical drum sounds (similar to Birdman)
are also present. In total, this movie really surprised me and I hope that it gets the
recognition it deserves and I cannot wait to read the book about the
story of Hugh Glass!

Even if its story might leave some viewers literally cold, The Revenant
is a sensational technical achievement so meticulous it could only have
been crafted by a cinematic mad scientist.Leonardo DiCaprio gives a
thoroughly committed performance as Hugh Glass, a resilient and
resourceful trader in the 19th century Rockies who is loyal to both the
native Pawnee tribe  as reflected in his marriage and young son  and
to a collection of hunters trying to navigate the rugged terrain.You almost wonder how Inarritu was able to pull this off, not only
logistically but physically, employing consistently long takes and
natural light within his remote locations.The film's visual beauty
provides a striking contrast to the relentless brutal violence. It's an
epic portrait of man versus nature that makes Bear Grylls seem like Mr.
Rogers.DiCaprio wonderfully balances strength and vulnerability in a
portrayal that requires him to rely primarily on body language and
facial expressions. The ensemble cast uses obscure accents that
resonate with authenticity (and they're difficult to comprehend at
times), along with the requisite bushy beards.While hinting at deeper subtext, it stretches credibility and indulges
in heavy-handed symbolism along the way, but The Revenant is a feast
for the senses that's both difficult to watch and impossible from which
to turn away.

Although it took home the Best Picture gong last year and I personally
found it an immersing and wonderfully bizarre experience, Birdman Or
(The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) was far from the year's most
satisfying movie. Still, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu
demonstrated enough desire to take the movie-going experience to the
next level (with unfathomably long takes masterminded by
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki) to have me excited about his next
project, and the revelation that it was to be set in 1820's America
around the legendary story of Hugh Glass had me foaming at the gills.
While The Revenant is not the masterpiece I was hoping for, it is a
gruelling, brutal and frequently breathtaking tale of survival.Glass's story has been altered to fit a more conventional narrative,
and the opening scenes introduce us, Terrence Malick-style, to his
Pawnee wife (Grace Dove) and son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), in flashback.
These floaty, dream-like moments quickly give way to the harshness of
the Louisiana wilderness where Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his son
are working as part of a fur-trapper party under the command of Captain
Henry (Domhnall Glesson). While Glass hunts for pelts, the rest of the
party are set upon by hostile Arikara Indians, who slaughter a third of
the men before the ragged group, with Glass, escape down river. This
opening scene, as teased in the trailer, is the film's Omaha Beach, and
is captured by Lubezki's never-still camera, constantly swirling from
one act of brutality to the next.We jump on the back of the horse and off again, follow men as they kill
and then be killed, under water and onto a boat, and then we are left
to catch our breath. Combined with the eerie score, it makes for a
delirious and awe-aspiring set-piece. As the group decide just how to
get back to camp with their lives, they touch land again where Glass is
set upon by a grizzly bear, in what is surely cinema's most convincing
moment of man vs. nature. The attack has been compared to a rape, and
as Glass screams for his life while being brutally and helplessly torn
apart by the giant beast, it's hard to avoid the comparison. Found by
his group, he is left in the care of the unhinged John Fitzgerald (Tom
Hardy) and youngster Jim Bridger (Will Pouler). Betrayed and left for
dead, Glass must drag his broken body across 200 miles of wilderness
for revenge.The famously difficult shoot, in which the crew were given the task of
shooting chronologically on location using natural lighting, all in the
harshest of environments, certainly benefits the film. The exhaustion
is etched on the character's faces, with DiCaprio in particular
carrying the film on his shredded back as he sucks marrow from a
long-dead animal carcass and snuggles up inside the body of a horse for
warmth. The film doesn't so much celebrate the strength of human will
when faced with impossible odds, but marvel at how much the human body
can withstand in the most unwelcome of locations. Through Lubezki's
lens, the wilderness has never been a more fearsome foe, but also
rarely quite as beautiful. Both DiCaprio and Lubezki are surely odds on
favourites come Oscar time - the former a talent deserving of Academy
recognition and the latter looking for his third triumph in as many
years.However, the film is not without its flaws. The tweeks to Glass's
real-life story (or what is known of it) mean that Inarritu has opted
for a more conventional revenge flick that side-steps any deeper
questions that may arise about America's dark history, and fails to add
any real dimension to the other races caught up in the action. The
Arikara's certainly have a reason for their relentless pursuit, but no
explanation is given to why this group is so hostile. The same can be
said for the team of French trappers, who appear briefly and serve as
little more than a plot device. Near the end of its 150 minute running
time, it ponders the purpose of revenge like a thousand movies before
it but fails to say anything new. Yet, while it arguably fails
thematically, The Revenant is at its best when its showing off,
delivering a couple of key set-pieces that throw you head-first into
the mayhem like nothing else I've seen, backed by impressive
performances by DiCaprio and a mumbling Hardy.

'THE REVENANT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)This year's Oscar hopeful, from last year's Academy Award winning
director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; is this action/western epic (inspired
by the life of American frontiersman Hugh Glass). It's set in the
1820's, and tells the tale of Glass's obsession for revenge; against
the man who killed his son. The movie was directed by Iñárritu, and
co-written by Iñárritu and Mark L. Smith; based loosely on the 2002
novel, of the same name, by Michael Punke. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio
and Tom Hardy; and it costars Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter and
Forrest Goodluck. The film was originally budgeted at $60 million; but
costs ballooned to $135 million, by the end of filming (due to
excessive filming hardships). It's received mostly rave reviews from
critics, and it's also expected to be nominated for several major
Academy Awards; with DiCaprio a favorite to (finally) win Best Actor.
Despite the painfully slow pacing (at times), I really enjoyed it.The story is set in 1823, and it follows a hunting party; searching for
pelts, in the Louisiana Purchase wilderness. The most experienced
hunter, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), is mauled by a mother grizzly bear;
protecting her cubs. Glass's party tries to keep him alive, and take
him with them; but he becomes too much of a burden, to their survival.
Captain Andrew Henry (Gleeson) offers three men extra pay; to stay
behind with Glass, until he passes (to give him a proper burial).
Glass's son Hawk, a half-blooded Native American, volunteers; as do
John Fitzgerald (Hardy) and Jim Bridger (Poulter). The opportunistic
Fitzgerald attempts to kill Glass, by smothering him, and instead kills
Hawk, to silence him; when the boy tries to rescue his father
(unbeknownst to Bridger). Glass, who's then left for dead by the two
others, miraculously survives his deadly wounds. He then makes it his
mission, to get revenge on Fitzgerald; for the death of his son.The movie looks breathtaking, and the story always seems very epic. The
action scenes are spectacular, and also very realistic looking.
DiCaprio is amazing in the film; and he definitely deserves an Oscar
(like he has for years now). Tom Hardy (my favorite actor) is also very
good, in his despicable antagonistic role. Iñárritu is a very gifted
director; but (like any really talented artist) when he's given
complete reign of a project (like this), he lets his ego get a little
too inflated. He's said to be a very hard filmmaker to work with, but
he definitely gets results (this film does seem self indulgent though).
The pacing is way too slow; with 15 to 30 minutes more cut out of it,
it could have been a true masterpiece. It's still a great film though,
and it's definitely worth seeing; for it's stunning visuals,
entertaining action sequences, and amazing performances.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:

- watch it - spend the first one and a half hour asking yourself "what
is the story?!" - enjoy the landscape - enjoy the last 30 minutes -
never watch this movie againIt is one of those movies, which I did not hate, but it has been drawn
into the length a lot. When it was over, people were walking out of the
cinema asking themself; was that it?I will admit; Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite actor of all times.
However, I do not understand why he should win an Oscar for this
performance? In my opinion, you could replace Leo (and the same is true
for Tom Hardy) with any random non-name actor and the movie would not
change a bit.

Declaring a movie the best of the year is not going to make you many
friends. This act is a little pretentious, only serving to isolate most
listeners. But 2015 was a disappointing year. The marquee names
(Spielberg, Tarantino, Russell?) failed to deliver movies with any
chances of reaching the top half of each director's filmography. The
awards bait was lukewarm, our dear indie and international friends
largely failed to make any ripples in the pond. I concede we got the
best summer movie of recent memory, but I just need something more to
care about. The Revenant is the best movie of the year because it is
ambitious and beautiful. A dangerous film, with many potential
vulnerabilities that were solved by its reliance on exemplary talent. I
am simply giddy that 2015 delivered a film this great.The Revenant is a western/thriller meditation on vengeance and
survival. Frontiersman Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is betrayed and abandoned
by comrade (Hardy) who murdered his son (Forrest Goodluck, not that you
likely care, but what a name). The next two thirds is Glass' relentless
pursuit. Sure, obviously other events happen along the journey, but
largely it is a straight foreword plot with simple motivations. Some
complexity is introduced by side Native American characters who are
also dealing with tragedy. But at its core, Revenant is sparse. This
emptiness allows for creative space to be filled with stylistic
bravado. The Revenant is continually interrupted by unrushed shots of
natural magnificence. This style can best be described as more
watchable Malick. I am sure most popular criticism will be aimed at
this decision. Sure it's a reasonably long run time, but I was
certainly not bored. Thrillers are all about manipulating the temporal.
Each break is a conflicted dose of both relaxation and stress.
Relaxation derived from simple gorgeousness, stress because it is a
distraction from imminent peril.Style over substance films are extremely risky. Potentially irritably
ostentatious, these movie can needle or put an audience to sleep with
ease. Enter our artists/champions. No one can perfectly answer what a
director brings to a movie, but Inarritu has established himself as a
titan. The Revenant is a grand vision that requires virtually every
aspect to be synchronized. I credit Inarritu. Slightly more tangible
are Lubezki's contributions. The cinematographer made brutal action
scenes and calm portrayals of trees equally stunning to behold.
DiCaprio's role in this is almost impossible. He was asked to carry an
entire movie largely without talking. Not to mention wrestle a CGI
bear. He was up to the task, there is not an off note in his
performance. Hardy is even more likable. His role is less demanding,
but he is equally brilliant. Hardy plays pure evil unabashed with an
impeccable drawl. If we just skipped the Oscars this year and threw
them all at The Revenant's creators, I would not be overly
disappointed.Praise be to The Revenant. I refuse to even acknowledge the many I know
who will simply find this movie frustrating. I am excited, and
hopefully contagious. Movies of this caliber simply need to be
celebrated.

This movie had the potential to become one of my top 10 of all time.
Cinematically it's flawless with the most amazing film work I've ever
seen. It wasn't until after I saw the movie that I learned they filmed
the whole thing in natural light, and it shows. You will not see
cleaner more crisp landscapes in any other movie. The acting is
likewise FLAWLESS. I found DiCaprio and Hardy to deliver Oscar worthy
performances, and honestly, I think Hardy did a better job than
DiCaprio, although whether that was due to how the characters were
written or not I cannot tell.The only fault I found with this movie was the PLOT, and it all but
destroyed it for me. The use of continual strife and injury with the
main character to create suspense; I've always found that to be a
shallow method. But there are times when it works: the Rocky movies,
Die Hard, etc... However, with The Revenant, I reached a point where I
began to disbelieve DiCaprio's character. He was injured so many times,
and so grievously over and over, it became absurd. How many times can a
man be stabbed, shot, dropped, bashed, smashed, drowned, broken etc...
before he is unable to continue? It made the script drag, and in the
middle of the movie, I actually began checking my watch.Oh well. SO CLOSE!

Still, for as much as the environment is in the spotlight, DiCaprio and
Hardy are undoubtedly the two consistent driving forces. Rendering John
with an inherent craze, Hardy employs the same commutative eyes from
The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max: Fury Road, except behind a barbaric
wad of facial hair, almost biker gang-esquemaking his less morally
inclined reflection of Hugh into a dangerously unpredictable
survivalist. Not to be outdone, DiCaprio has reportedly called this
role the most taxing of his career. Upon research it's easy to see why:
not only did the vegetarian actor consume a hunk of raw bison's liver,
but he also had to learn to properly shoot a musket, build a fire,
speak both Pawnee and Arikara languages, and study ancient healing
methods. But you don't need to hop on Google to fully appreciate
DiCaprio's commitment, just witnessing the actor crawl through the snow
and dirt, devour a raw fishin a enormous fur coat, scraping bone
marrow from an already-devoured corpse, the actor is evidently immersed
in this animalistic transformation. And, interestingly enough,
DiCaprio, speaking maybe 20 or so lines in the entire film, likely made
the conscious decision to opt for a more physically demanding role when
turning down the lead for Steve Jobs and Sorkin's witty dialogue. After
all, since The Academy didn't award his vulgar wolf the year prior it
only makes sense that now he actually has to become one.FULL REVIEW HERE:

A good movie, but over hyped. If not for all the hype, I would say The
Revenant is a solid movie. A break from Hollywood's political correct
narrative where the storyline is black and white. With characters and
groups are all evil or all good, The Revenant is a grey storyline
clouded with the premise of what really happened! As it is in the wild,
nomadically running around the social contract, and rule of law
diminish into natural law. The law of nature where if one goes hungry
if the hunt does not go well, you could be the one hunted. One could
even understand the brute, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), was trying to
survive as a cunning animal. The bear was trying to protect her cubs.
The Revenant tries to show the brutality of nature. Would not be to
quick in urban society if there were food shortages,people would revert
back to 150 to 200 hundred years ago. The Revenant accurately creates
the good and evil of people in a desperate experience. 7 out of 10

I see snow and men with beards in a movie poster? I don't watch the
movie. Because I know it's not going to be a Shawshank Redemption. It's
going to be a lot of snow and despondent men trying to get away from
the snow. You take away the snow and the story fits on a post- it note.
Ain't nobody got time for that. But I had to watch the Revenant because
it had Leo in a role that might finally win him his Oscar and the
brilliant Mr.Tom Hardy. Was I entertained? Sure. Would I watch this
movie a second time. No way! Was Leo good in it? Definitely. Was the
performance Oscar worthy? Perhaps. But it is unfair to take a man, kill
him half to death, drag his ass across icy terrain for 180 minutes and
then give him an Oscar. Leo has better performances to his credit. Tom
Hardy stands a better chance to win for his amazing performance as a
Texan even though he is an English actor. Also, I don't understand what
it is with Leo and flashbacks to his dead wife as in Shutter Island and
Inception. It was absolutely unnecessary in this movie. Good movie
overall, but I don't think the film will win the Best Film award and
Sean Penn will again make a racist joke about Inarritu. There are
better contenders to that spot.

I had high hopes for The Revenant. The director made my favorite film
last year (Birdman), a movie unlike any I'd seen prior. Yes, I've seen
other films about the frontier, but I've never seen anything like The
Revenant. It was incredibly beautiful, intense, visceral, chilling, and
ultra real... I'm officially an Inarritu fanboy...And I'm seriously
pulling for Dicaprio at the Academy Awards. Somebody give that man an
Oscar before he kills himself trying to get one! What a committed
performance! This movie is so beautiful, it makes my head hurt.
Emmanuel Lubezki...pick up your Oscar at the front desk...I think
Alejandro will take the best director Oscar again...

Unless you're a sadist, The Revenant won't make you "feel good". Its
aims are more visceral than that. Yes, the already infamous bear attack
sequence is unlike anything you've ever seen, but that's not all that
will puncture your skin. The splash of water. The smoke of gunfire. The
embers from the fire. The spit escaping from freeze-dried lips. The
blood-stained rivers and snow. You feel every bit. Pulling from master
filmmakers like Malick, Tarchovsky, and Kurosawa, Inarritu gives us a
poetic western that, while not quite as impenetrable as its influences,
still stuns with an intensity only matched by its graceful beauty. The
unbelievable story of Hugh Glass, an 1800s frontiersman left for dead
in a snow-covered wasteland, is a story of endurance. But unlike this
year's Martian, which celebrated hard-science as a means of survival,
Revenant is focuses on sheer force of will. The trials Glass suffers
are abandoned with intensity, and DiCaprio gives an unrelentingly
committed performance. However, the real star is director of
photography Emmauel Lubezki (Birdman, Gravity), who delivers a
shockingly graceful look at a merciless subject. Fluid, gritty, and
focused, we're given a beautiful 360-degree view of the treacherous
snow-scape. Director Innaritu doesn't give us quite the full scope of
character that Lubezki does of visuals. The dialogue is passable at
best, and clichéd and ham-fisted at worst. This made the 156 minutes
drag some, especially in the middle. Luckily, the strength of the
themes still comes through: despite whom or what we encounter, our only
true enemy is death. Bleak? Surebut Revenant rises above its misery as
a lesson in fearless filmmaking.

I did think the Revenant was a solid movie. The acting was phenomenal.
The scenery was beautiful. Wow, that fight scene with the bear might go
down in history. Outside of that the movie was pretty average. The
movie had very little character build up. IT was a little drawn out at
times as well. I do think some Oscars need to go to Leo and Tom Hardy,
i can tell they put a lot into it, I just wish the writer put the same
amount of effort in. Acting -10Scenery - 9story -5 rewatchability - 3

The Revenant is most certainly one of the best films I have seen in my
lifetime. It achieves what few if any this reviewer has enjoyed. All of
the hoopla about natural light and crew abandonment seem quite
credible. This achievement would not be for the timid, whether they are
crew or cine enthusiasts. It is extremely realistic in it's brutality.
And in that crush of reality of western yore you are also treated to
some beautiful majestic and sometimes almost unbelievable captures of
the landscape of the Northwestern American continent. There is ode to
to past cinema styles and inferences, most notably the dream sequences.
But the persistent theme is survival and justice. Not included in the
trailer is how specific this film is about the plight of the indigenous
people of Northwestern America. And they play a fascinating role in the
story. By now, you know the Golden Globe awards this film has received
and rightly so. Awesome is a word so over used in our vocabulary today
so I will submit to awe inspiring. Truly an unforgettable classic.

The bleak image from the trailer of Leonardo DiCaprio's face as he
writhes uncomfortably on a cot, unable to speak or move, really sums up
this film. Alejandro Iñárritu successfully contrasts the beauty of the
American Western frontier with the ugliness of humanity, but forgoes
embedding a solid narrative while doing so. Each piece of imagery is as
striking as the last, but the narrative that drives these images
forward made me wonder how many times Glass (DiCaprio) was going to be
tortured before he accomplished his task. The audience at the theater
around me cringed a little bit more with each new gash, contortion, and
bone fracture, and rightfully so. The images of nature serve as brief
respites between the intense pain that Leo must have actually
physically gone through to act out this role.Throughout the entire film, it is evident that Iñárritu wanted to
de-romanticize the American Western film genre. By setting the film in
the dead of winter, viewers are given insight on how difficult battling
both man and nature must have been at this point in time. Without
giving away too many plot details, the movie is a classic revenge
story, but does not stay focused on the revenge aspect for too long. In
fact, at one point Iñárritu explicitly reminds his audience that the
movie indeed is a revenge film, and not just a montage of DiCaprio
getting the crap beaten out of him. Even with sparse dialogue, Iñárritu
manages to convey the emotions of the characters brilliantly with the
use of some clever camera work and the outstanding acting of the cast.
Most of the credit has to be given to Leo here, he breathes life into
Glass, with every pained facial expression, and eyes hungry for sweet
vengeance.Though The Revenant manages to break new ground in visual storytelling,
offering some of the most breathtaking shots I've ever seen in cinema,
and yet something is lacking. The muddled flashback sequences did
elucidate enough of the back story of Glass' character, and yet, we
never feel the true extent of his plight. If the script was structured
in such a way as to make the viewer care more about Glass and his son,
I would have been doubly engrossed in this film, but the scenery and
cinematography speak for themselves. I can only hope that Iñárritu
returns to this style of film, because with a few tweaks to the
screenplay, this movie could have been a must watch.

This is a beautifully set movie. The basic plot unfortunately was
fairly formulaic.As a Canadian in the throws of winter I don't particularly enjoy
watching a movie set in the cold of winter as well. I have enough of
that when I step outside! My biggest problem with this movie is simple
reality. You do not go fording across a stream in winter on foot or on
a house without consequences. Mountain streams can be freezing cold in
spring(I have panned for gold in the mountains), so you can imagine how
cold they are during the winter. To most this would seem a trivial
thing, but I would hate for any kids to think this was OK. I also really don't go in for this over the top superhuman effort
stuff. This character never seems to get ten miles without taking some
horrible physical damage. Unlike most of this genre of film, this movie is totally without humour
which makes the unrelenting suffering particularly hard to watch. It
reminds me of "up" which I couldn't watch to the end. The bottom line I
guess is I did not "enjoy" watching this movie. That all said, this is a well acted and directed and worth a watch.

The Revenant is an ironic tragedy, set in the frontier in the 1800s and
featuring a cast entirely of men. Yet it is not about them, their
masculinity or an examination of male friendship. The film's Mexican
director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is employing much broader themes
that transcend the specifics of gender and stereotypes. The film could
be viewed simplistically as a bloody revenge story on horseback but it
inherits complexity through its contrasting themes and images. Similar
to Iñárritu's previous film Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of
Ignorance), it is about different facets of the human condition but
differentiates itself through the way these traits are tested through
the myth of righteous violence. Whereas Birdman overflowed brilliantly
with many different ideas, Iñárritu' has learnt to judiciously select
his themes. The film uses its characters to develop a consistent
pattern for its thematic and ideological goals, starting with its
antagonist. Tom Hardy as the film's villain Fitzgerald embodies the
notion of self-preservation, which provides his character with some
accessibility to his psychology, surpassing his slurred accent and
intimidating nature. He is a man with patches sitting between his long
shaggy hair, which makes it visible that he was at some point nearly
scalped, an incident fuelling his desire to protect himself before
others and survive.An observant way the film shows how much his wounds trouble him is when
he tells someone to stop scraping their knife because the noise reminds
him of his encounter with death. The incident from his past ignites his
current attitude because although they belong to the same company of
troops delivering pelts, Fitzgerald is reluctant to help his fellow
traveler Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) after he is mauled by a bear.
The other men in the group try caring for him in the snowy woodlands,
but Fitzgerald insists on leaving him and also preparing to kill him.
The scenes where the men, including Fitzgerald, are carrying his body
on a stretcher through the icy terrain are an example of the film
creating a broad morality question for its characters about self-
preservation through its image and its setting rather than emphasising
the physical toughness of its characters. The film is also less
scattershot than Birdman in its ideologies and aims. Iñárritu,
presumably spurred by the difficulty of the frost conditions, has
realised the need for narrative discipline, using the images
exclusively rather than dialogue to enhance its universal ideas such as
self-preservation. Another example of the film divorcing itself from
gender is through its protagonist Hugh Glass, who is not challenged
solely by mindless violence and masculinity as some have argued.
Rather, he is tested by the weight of his compassion, which drives him
blindly towards righteous violence. Every scene in the film questions
one's compassion and empathy on the path to revenge, long before Glass
can right his young Indian son's death at Fitzgerald's hand, who also
left him for dead. The most transparent example of compassion for his
child is the physical turmoil Glass experiences to avenge him.
Throughout the film, Leonardo DiCaprio shows extraordinary physicality
to crawl through the ice and snow. The enormous physical strains,
enduring the cuts on his back, having his throat slashed, curling up by
handmade fires, dodging arrows and avoiding starvation, become a visual
pattern and image system showing the physical endurance a person could
pursue out of love for their children. The geography and compositions
further compliment and enhance the emotional and physical struggle. The
camera zooms tightly on Glass's face to show the strain and urgency of
his body but retracts to both wide and extreme long shots to highlight
the extremity of the wintery conditions and underline the physical
duration he is imposing on himself out of love.The Revenant also expresses compassion and empathy's problematic nature
in a series of exciting episodes, such as the aforementioned scenes of
the men torn on carrying Glass's body. Additionally, flashbacks and
dreams visualise the murder of Glass's wife and her village being
destroyed by officers, which are factors of guilt, love and madness
driving him towards Fitzgerald. In another tense scene, he is
attempting to steal a horse from a camp but his escape is interrupted
by a woman being assaulted, prompting Glass to choose to aid her and
blow his cover. Similarly, an Indian helps Glass recover from his
wounds but the bond results in the man being hanged and branded a
traitor. These are examples of the film questioning the value of their
friendship and helping others and whether it outweighs our own
wellbeing. Glass also finds compassion in the wildlife because after
his horse is destroyed in a terrible fall, he removes its entrails and
places himself inside its body to stay warm. It is metaphorical and a
contrast to the film's bear attack scene, where the bear launches
itself at him to protect its cubs. Being inside the horse is a mirror
of when he was crushed underneath the bear, only now he understands the
pain of an animal attempting to protect itself. These memorable
episodes reflect the film's narrative economics, using the landscapes,
the action scenes and character development to divorce itself from
gender stereotypes and comment on the physical and mental toll of
compassion as one pursues revenge and becomes increasingly dehumanised.

The Director, Alejandro González Iñárritu paint's a series of beautiful
pictures. It's honestly one of the most visually stunning film's I have
ever seen. Camera work is unbelievable. Knowing what the Actor's went
through to film this, and knowing that Nature provided the green
screen, this movie will leave you in awe. For long stretches, there
were important scene's that seem to connect to the next one, so it's
like flipping a page on a book, and every page being crucial to the
story. Starts out great, and the Natives they used seemed so authentic.
The way the movie was shot, it felt like you was really there watching
it in a dream.The camera angles, the raw acting, the action, and the story were all
at the top of their game. When this film sweep's the Oscars- just know-
It's Deserving!

This movie was a let down. A horrible and incomplete music score. If
there was a moment with music, nearly all of it was random orchestral
chords where someone turned up the volume really fast, then turned it
down just as quick. Way too many scenery shots - we got the point on
the first 2 or 3 shots - that this 2h48m movie could have easily been
chopped down to 2h. It was like like a tourist having never been to a
place most people have - they take pictures of everything and have to
show every picture to everyone. While Leo was good, for mostly non-
dialogue role, the character isn't prominent enough to take any awards
home (like he should have with his earlier movies).

Very intense and not for those who have weak stomachs. Displays what
man and beast will do for their young. Lad has gained my respect with
his performance in this film. On the other hand don't see this movie as
a first date, because the night won't end like you hope it will. Tom
Hardy plays his role well, even though I don't like him as the "bad
guy" role. Just don't try to understand what he is saying for most of
the movie unless you are from the back woods of Arkansas. They never
say where they are at in the U.S. but they give plenty of hints if you
pay attention. Another thing, take a jacket with you when you see this
movie because it's going to make you feel cold even if it's 98F
outside. This movie does a great job of showing how brutal nature is
and how weak the human race is towards it. We just think that we can
survive anything, but really only one in a million can make it through
something like this guy does. This is a "Must see" movie!

You will hear a lot about how difficult the filmmaking process (though
it was not shot on film, but digital) was in The Revenant. You will
hear a lot about the length the actors, director and crew went to make
things real. But to quote Jack Nicholson quote Stanley Kubrick:"Jack, it's real but it's not interesting."There's a lot of good work from every member of the cast and crew of
the show here. I commend them all on their fine work. But I did not
identify with anybody except Arthur Redcloud's Hikuc, and even then,
his appearance is all too brief. This movie would be easier to review
if there was more wrong with it, but I cannot offer some academic or
faux intellectual retort. My personal criticism is just that, personal.
And my personal opinion was I simply did not feel invested in any of
the characters in the movie or what they went through. Instead of a journey, surviving to the predictable end feels like a
slog. And when it was all over. I really didn't feel anything for
anybody. Maybe it's just me. I'll accept that.Iñnaritu is a master of despair, but he isn't a dramatist and Revenant
hasn't advanced his craft.If you are interested in films about the trials of survival or snowy
mindscapes, try "Touching the Void." The tonally similar, and far more
contrived, "The Gray" is another one I would rather watch. I just found
myself far more invested in watching Liam Neeson face off with a wolf
than Leo sleep in a horse carcass.

For starters there may be some mild spoilers, I'll try to avoid that as
much as I can though. This film is, in a nutshell, The Grey meets The
Last of the Mohicans. And it's brilliant. Forget Star Wars, this is
really the best film all year. I'm not ever sure where to start except
for the fact that I don't write many reviews, unless I really feel
moved to say something about a film. This film is beautiful and raw.
With one of it's main draws being the cinematography being some of the
most beautiful I've seen in years. (Every frame could be a picture
worthy of being hung in your house as fine art, on par with Ansel
Adam's photographs) It's shot by the same man who shot Children of Men
(another beautiful and raw film). Anyways I digress. This film is a
triumphs showing the resolve of the human spirit in as horrible a
situation as ever put to film. Seriously leave the kids at home for
this one, I've seen some gory movies in my days and this one made me
uneasy at times. Hugh Glass is a fur trapper in the 1820s American West
who's wife was killed by Americans prior to the film and his fur
trapping crew by Indians. Shortly afterward they flee and Glass
explores and scouts their surrounding area of their camp where he's
attacked by a bear. It gets worse, after bandaging him up they leave
him with his boy and two others to basically have a few men around to
give him a proper burial. It gets worse, one of the men kills his son
as he's basically paralyzed watching. It gets worse, he then is truly
left for dead in a shallow grave where he isn't even fully buried. It
gets worse.. but if I went on I'd ruin the movie. Okay spoilers over
(even though you can deduct this from the trailers, I decided to play
it safe with IMDb). The reason to see this film is one just how
beautifully shot it is. Two DiCapprio's (most likely) Oscar Snub
performance, as a man driven to his limits to survive and get revenge.
Three for the most engaging film I've seen all year that demands your
attention till the end. I was blown away by the rawness of this film.
It's a difficult watch for sure, but one of the most engrossing films
of recent memory. And with some neat symbolism, reoccurring motifs to
give it some thematic heft, and riveting story it's hard to miss. While
at deeper glance it might be a little light on story, as it is pretty
straight forward. It's at heart a man v. nature, man v. self, man v.
man conflict movie, and what else do you really need to have a good
story. Most films only attempt a conflict around one of these ideas.
While some of the dialogue seems too modern (mainly the swear words).
And gunpowder muskets that never seem to be affected by snow or water.
You'd be hard-pressed to survive a situation like this and not want to
tell a hard boiled tale of survival of how you were a shining example
of true grit and resolve.

The Revenant is a film that draws you into it's world without much
dialogue and more atmosphere and tension.A hunter named Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) ends up being mulled by a
bear and he fights alone in the woods to stay alive.The film has terrific direction and writing by director Alejangro
Gonzalez Inarritu and the cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy
are fantastic especially the lead roles by DiCaprio and Hardy, The
film's score is very haunting and eerie at times, The violence is very
well done and very graphic.Overall the film is a powerful tale of survival and this might be
DiCaprio's Oscar gold here. 9/10

I expected more. This movie tries, it really does, but in 2 hours and 36 minutes I began
to long for the sound of the human voice, much like "Cast Away" (2000),
not to mention that even mountain beauty begins to look like just so
much more snow after awhile, especially when filmed in constant
dreariness.The actual, fact-based premise is virtually unbelievable; nevertheless,
the director heaped on even more, e.g., from single-shot pistols firing
more than once to 50 Indians unable to bring down one severely crippled
man at 25 feet.Little things begin to grate after a couple hours, e.g., long close-ups
of Leo's snot-frozen beard, horses that were clearly malnourished, and
grime and filth so constant that I wanted to take a shower. Character
development is nonexistent, with only Captain Henry piquing our
interest anyway. Jim Bridger, one of America's most famous mountain
men, comes across mostly as a sniveling teenage murder accomplice.In the final analysis perhaps I'm hardest on films I love the most,
i.e., the Western genre, to which this qualifies, but instead of a
lasting memorial chronicle of the West like "Dances With Wolves"
(1990), we're left with yet another grimy, gory, outdoor thriller with
a bear.

It's 1823 and a gang of hunters are searching for pelts in the
wilderness of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. The land is made
even more treacherous with the presence of the Native American Arikara
Indians, who have staged an ambush for the hunters, leaving only ten of
the men with no other option but to take a raft deeper into the
wilderness.Amidst the ambush, the team's most experienced hunter and guider Hugh
Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) winds up being mauled by a mother grizzly
bear in effort to protect her cubs. In the process, he is seriously
injured, with his throat slit, his back mangled and bloodied, and his
entire body left in a ravaged mess. The gang finds the mangled Glass
and is uncertain what to do with him, despite the party's loudest
voice, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), suggesting they simply put Glass
out of his misery and move forward. Nonetheless, they do their best to
care for him until two young boys, Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) and Hawk
(Forrest Goodluck), Glass's son, offer to stay behind and care for
Glass, with Fitzgerald keeping a watchful eye.When Bridger is gone gathering water, Fitzgerald winds up killing Hawk
when he begins to weep for his father, leaving a helpless Glass to
witness his boy be murdered right before his eyes. When Bridger finally
returns, Fitzgerald claims to be unsure of Hawk's whereabouts and
demands that the two leave quickly, claiming he saw Indians down by the
creek, leaving Glass for dead. As the weather worsens, with blizzards
and avalanches abound, Glass does his best to maintain his health and
his safety as he finds his way back to camp to exact revenge on
Fitzgerald for his son's death.It was only logical that, after giving us the terrific "Birdman or (The
Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)" a year ago, writer/director Alejandro
G. Iñárritu would stun us all again with a film that is sure to grace
the Academy Awards with plenty of nominations. Iñárritu and
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki are the best director/cinematographer
team of 2015, alongside Quentin Tarantino and Robert Richardson for
"The Hateful Eight," and Denis Villeneueve and Roger Deakins for
"Sicario." With that, Iñárritu and Lubezki (also the cinematographer on
"Birdman" and "Gravity") embellish uncommonly natural locational beauty
to contrast with the downright evilness of the characters that inhabit
the land.Iñárritu and Lubezki, similar to the Ultra Panavision 70 route that
Tarantino and Richardson opted for with "The Hateful Eight," capture
the lavish land of Alaska with plenty of evocative wide-angle shots
that do wonders in showcasing the facial details of the characters in
addition to the details of the background. "The Revenant" is as much
about the frigid conditions of the brutal wilderness as it is about
character redemption, and Iñárritu and Lubezki do a tremendous job of
keeping both in mind as the film progresses. These kinds of films
really bring forth a meditative light, and I'll say some moments in the
film make you become lost in the scenery and the land itself.The biggest battle with "The Revenant" isn't so much the unflinching
sequence that shows Glass getting mauled by a grizzly bear, complete
with blood-curdling screams, bone-crunching, and every other nasty
auditory detail of a mauling, but its length and its simplicity. Coming
off of "Birdman," a film I still regard as pretty under-seen given its
accolades and a truly fascinating tale of potential and struggling to
live up to your own name, Iñárritu takes a complete one-eighty with
this film, being that it's in a totally different setting and focuses
on much clearer character motivations.Because of that, after seeing him tackle such lofty ideas in "Birdman,"
"The Revenant" can't help but feel slight in comparison, or even on its
own. Once you get through the extremely brutal sequences in the
beginning of the film, the remainder of the film's weight rests on the
shoulders of DiCaprio, a proved performer who even seems to struggle
with the emptiness of his character. While I don't believe this should
be the film to finally earn DiCaprio the Oscar, his performance in the
film is much more physical than it was ever meant to be anything else.
On that note, he succeeds incredibly, never appearing unbelievable or
corny, but yet, there's not much to view Glass as other than a
revenge-seeking man.And being that this film is one-hundred and fifty-six minutes, just
eleven-minutes shy of the theatrical cut of "The Hateful Eight," a film
with far more dialog and character interest, "The Revenant" is
sometimes a chore to sit through, despite all it does well for its
simple story. Iñárritu and Lubezki's directorial and cinematographical
work needs to be appreciated and praised, and DiCaprio's performance
also needs to find its way to be commended for its physicality (also,
don't sleep on Will Poulter, who shows some real emotional chops
playing both conflicted and manipulated), yet that shouldn't excuse
"The Revenant" for its slight nature overall.

"The Revenant" should be rewarded for beautiful cinematography during
the awards season. It is difficult to understate the gore and graphic
violence on display. In the early going, the trapper played by Leonard
DiCaprio is nearly eaten by a bear, and his throat is mauled.
Thereafter, there is almost no dialogue from him. This film takes place
in the western U.S. in the 1820s and purports to be a true tale about
an adventurer named Hugh Glass.The director does not shy away from any of the bloody cruelty suffered
by the protagonist. The environment is hostile because both man and
beast are ferocious. Men are vicious and untrustworthy. Adding to the unintelligible dialogue are the native American dialects
which were spoken (with subtitles.)Even though we witness terrific violence and slaughter, the carnage is
laid out as simply factual. We know little about the lead character
except that he has a strong survival instinct. It reminded me of work by Terrence Malick - the minimization of
dialogue and the lack of human connectedness.

A year ago around this time I think everyone predicted that The
Revenant would finally be the film to get Leonardo DiCaprio his Oscar.
While I'm not sure his performance holds up against the other greats of
2015, particularly Fassbender as Steve Jobs, I will say that The
Revenant is a cinematic achievement and one that should be recognized.
It contains probably the most impressive cinematography of any film of
this past year to go along with the jarring brutality this story brings
to the table. While I don't think The Revenant is the best film of the
year, it certainly deserves to be in the discussion.The Revenant is a far more artsy film than I expected. It's directed by
Alejandro González Iñárritu, director of last years' best picture
winner Birdman, and done so brilliantly. The direction along with
Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is some of the best of the year. I
think the problem with the film lies more with the script, also
co-written by Iñárritu. The film is centered on DiCaprio's character
seeking revenge against the man who left him for dead and killed his
son after getting mauled by a bear, but the film lacks balance in its
storytelling. I love the brutal, raw, grittiness of the story and you
certainly feel the intensity in those scenes. But the minimal dialogue
and in Tom Hardy's case, sometimes inaudible dialogue, you sometimes
lose the emotional connection to the characters.The gorgeous cinematography does tend to overtake the films other
appealing aspects, such as the great performances from Hardy and
DiCaprio. Knowing about the incredibly difficult shoot they went
through behind the scenes attempting to make the film helps their Oscar
case in my opinion now that I've seen it. But I somehow still expected
more from both of them. One of the best parts about The Revenant, that The Hateful Eight also
did extremely well, was set the tone of the film through its
atmosphere. In both films you feel what the characters feel. When
DiCaprio was hungry or thirsty, I was too. It helps that the film was
shot entirely in natural light and real locations, which is unusual for
a main stream feature. There are plenty of memorable scenes in The
Revenant including an incredible opening long-take fight sequence, the
now famous bear mauling, and the films brutally bloody climax. The
Revenant is far from a let down, but I also don't think it reaches the
heights that we expected when we heard about the film over a year ago.+DiCaprio's commitment+Legendary cinematography+Memorable scenes+Sets the atmosphere perfectly-Perhaps a little too artsy-Lacks balance in its storytelling8.2/10

For those of you looking for an action movie, move along. It's another
artsy movie from Alejandro Gonzalez-Innaritu. For anyone wondering,
it's not as good as Birdman, but I think that was going to be a given.
What is quite surprising, and most incredible about this movie, is
Leonardo DiCaprio. He's given one earth-shattering performance after
another, and just when you think you've seen it all, he appears in
this. He just tortures himself. Crawling in the snow with his bare
fingers, chowing down on bloody deer meat, sleeping inside a warm horse
like a Tauntaun. He's simply fantastic. If he doesn't win the Oscar
this year, he'll never win one.The other standout is the cinematography. It's the best of it's kind
I've seen since "There Will Be Blood". Every scene looked absolutely
breathtaking. Without question, Chivo is the best cinematographer
working in the business today. As long as he keeps shooting movies,
everyone needs to step aside and let him show us all how it's done.Among all this praise, I don't think it's a perfect movie. It's biggest
flaw is the casting of Tom Hardy. We've all been hearing praise for his
performance, and at times, he does do a good job. But he sounds exactly
the same as he did in Lawless. It's the same voice. It's probably the
same voice for Bane too, but we won't be able to ever know for sure
behind the mask. That garbled, bullfrog.. yeah, try something else next
time, Tom. Also, I kind of would have liked the movie to do without the
stereotypical Native American side characters. I was having "Dances
with Wolves" flashbacks. Plus, it didn't really advance the main story,
other than the fact that those were people who the American's were
fighting at that time. Then again, i've never read the actual story..
but even if I did, I think that Glass's journey was far more
interesting cinematically.

Wow, what a roll Alejandro González Iñárritu is on! After his
Oscar-winning hit of Birdman, he now returns with a stellar picture
with The Revenant. I also liked 21 Grams and Babel, and together with
his two latest films he really shows what a breadth he has, I
definitely rank him as one of the strongest film-makers we have.The Revenant impresses for many reasons. Technically, it is a
masterpiece. The audience will recognise the fluid, almost levitating
cinematography from Birdman but instead of the more confined spaces of
a Broadway Theatre, The Revenant brilliantly cuts between close-up
shots of battles between soldiers and Native Americans and
wide-panorama shots of great American landscapes, equally beautiful and
brutal for "The Revenant" - Glass played by Leonardo Di Caprio. Di
Caprio delivers one of the strongest performances of an already strong
career, showing that his versatility as an actor is on par with the
greatest as he delivers a gritty and strenuous physical performance. SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW But my strongest take-away from this piece is not
its technical virtuosity, but its humanistic theme. One of the main
topics of The Revenant is survival and perseverance against all odds.
In this sense it is not unsimilar to this year's The Martian, where a
man is left for dead, survives and must go to extraordinary lengths to
make his way back. The other theme, of course absent in The Martian, is
about revenge and justice. What really resonated with me was the ending
and in my interpretation, how it shows the difference between achieving
justice and having revenge. I found the climactic scene very powerful,
when Glass finally has the opportunity to have the revenge he literally
has crawled from the grave to exert, but realises that his son won't be
brought back by killing his killer and that only God can be
Fitzgerald's final judge. As a viewer, we feel that Glass has made the
morally right decision, and we are rewarded with what has to be poetic
justice as we see that the Indian girl that Glass inadvertently but
compassionately has rescued from captivity has been reunited with her
tribe and we know that Fitzgerald drifts away to his final destiny in
the river. Glass doesn't know that the tribe has been travelling as far
as he has to find her, but as viewers we see that at least in fiction,
true justice is possible, and this of course is the beauty of fiction.
This theme of the value of revenge also echoes Inarritu's 21 Grams
where a women also is obsessed with revenge.On another level, I also view this movie as commentary about the
historic period and issues it touches - the colonialization of North
America and the Native Americans, a conflict that I still believe
lingers in the American psyche. Glass symbolises a man who has lived in
peace and in mutual acceptance with Natives, in contrast to Fitzgerald,
once near-scalped, ever-greedy and with the attitude that "they're all
savages". In this movie, Glass is the protagonist and Fitzgerald the
antagonist, but in reality, which camp's perspective actually won?In the end, I did rate this movie 8 out of 10. Why not 9 or 10? I did
feel that the many parts that depicts Glass's struggle and way back
were a bit unnecessary and repetitive. While Leo's performance
certainly is admirable, it's maybe not as multifaceted as one could
hope, it is basically only hardship, love for his son and revenge, not
much more. My strongest concern is that I don't think its theme of
survival against the odds, which takes up the biggest part of the
movie, is as strong as its theme about revenge and justice. This meant
that there were stretches of the movie where I felt more reaction than
emotion, reaction to gore or Glass's bad luck, rather than true, deep
emotion. All in all, I still think it is a very good movie and would
recommend anyone to see it, given that they aren't sensitive to blood
and violence.

My more than a year long wait for this movie was finally over and I
must say it was all worth it. Easily my best movie of 2015. This movie
is a VISUAL MASTERPIECE. I have perhaps never seen a movie with such
natural scenes, the beauty of the real nature is mesmerizing.There are many, many jaw dropping, eye-catching scenes in the movie
where you are left awestruck and amazed by the sheer beauty of filming
at such locations. The 1st few shots will tell you what dazzling beauty
lies ahead. Treat your eyes and if possible experience this movie in
the best theater around you when it releases.Leonardo DiCaprio is captivating in this movie. Simply stunning. Every
time we say it's his best performance and every time he comes up with a
better one. He deserves an Oscar for such marvel of a performance.There are so many scenes where you feel how can he be doing
this(especially the horse scene when Leo sleeps - no spoilers, you'll
understand when you see the movie).Tom Hardy has also produced one of his best performances till date.
Alejandro González Iñárritu has followed "Birdman" with another gem of
a movie. Revenant could be this year's best movie. Revenant is bound to
win multiple Oscars.

Quite possibly the most over hyped movie since the other very over
hyped movie. So it is any good? Or just full of bandwagon people scared to have an
opinion for themselves?The cinematography is simply stunning, the beautiful desolate landscape
demands nothing less. This is indeed the main selling point of a pretty
dull but captivating film. Not much happens, it's man, and I use that
word lightly, man (note there are only 3 woman in the film) vs the
elements.The dream sequences are equally as beautiful as the landscape, it's
very, very, Terrence Malick. (Those of you who are unaware of his films
check out The Tree The Life & To The Wonder). With the sun reflecting
through the trees and the haunting prophetic dialogue. These are the
best parts of the film, which in essence is a rather predictable epic.The performances are good, but not Oscar worthy. However, the cockerney
English actor is appalling. How on earth did he get that part? Its not a film for the feminists. My female friend hated it on every
level. The two or three woman in the film have a few lines between
them. One is used in a rape scene and the other is a ghost.I must say I actually preferred Valhalla Rising which was much darker
and had more of an unpredictable story line.Be warned, this film is very, very long. And quite boring at times. I'm
also sure Dicaprio would have died from hypothermia at some stage. It's
also amazing how quickly his clothes dry out!Worth any Oscars? Cinematography yes. Acting, not really. Paul Newman
who an over due Oscar for an average performance in the Colour of
Money, I feel the Academy will do the same for Leo.

To start, what an incredible film this was to watch. Not only was the
acting incredible to see, but the cinematography in this film was
absolutely beautiful. The stunning, yet eerie landscapes looked
spectacular and gave me a feel of the real thing.Dicaprio's performance as Hugh Glass was amazing and the efforts he
went to on and off screen for this production just shows what an
amazing actor he really is.Tom Hardy's performance as John Fitzgerald was also amazing and just
showed what a versatile actor he is. If you look at how different he is
in all his performances, (Bronson, Mad Max, Legend etc.) he always
pulls off the most convincing, entertaining and interesting roles
possible.If you want to see an Oscar worthy movie, with Oscar worthy actors
filmed by an Oscar worthy director, The Revenant is a must see!!

This film illustrates the power of the human will. You can tell by
looking at the scenes that the crew worked through harsh conditions but
still they pushed through and finished what they started.I loved the
indigenous characters in the film it showed their intelligence,
bravery, and connection to their surroundings and family members. It
showed how they suffered, lost, and fought to survive. The
cinematography is amazing. The scenes were well planned and executed
with creativity in each shot. The storytelling through images did not
even need words because the frames spoke for themselves. Leonardo
Dicaprio performance really gave me a new respect for him. He has
played some interesting roles but for him to take on a role that
challenged him physically and emotionally shows that he is growing as
an even greater actor.His role in this film took his status as a
celebrity and brought attention to the subjects of
brutality,greed,violence,faith, and the power of the human will. I knew
this film was going to be a great film since the first preview I saw at
the theaters. The film proved to be everything I was hoping it to be.
Salute to each and every person who contributed their time and energy
to this project.

A frontiersman (Leonardo DiCaprio) on a fur trading expedition in the
1820s fights for survival after being mauled by a bear and left for
dead by members of his own hunting team.The story of Hugh Glass has gone through a number of revisions in the
last two hundred years. There is first of all the true story, which
could never be known -- Glass himself likely embellished or
mis-remembered certain details. We then have various biographies, a
novel, and an earlier film "Man in the Wilderness" (1971).
Surprisingly, the latter has never had a home video release. This seems
like the optimal time to cash in. But that is neither here nor there.In this latest version, Glass has a son, which increases the emotional
factor. Is it historically accurate? No. But we should not allow the
facts to get in the way of a good story.With the Academy Award nominations out, "The Revenant" has become the
film to beat in a variety of categories. With twelve nominations, it is
certain to win a few. And the big buzz is that this is the year that
Leonardo DiCaprio will take home his first statuette.DiCaprio has been in the acting game for about thirty years and has had
countless memorable roles. Some are more serious than others, but he
has always done a fine job, even if the films did not call for such
professionalism. And as Hugh Glass, this is no doubt the finest
performance of his career. Through much of the film, he is left unable
to speak and his acting must come out non-verbally, which is
considerably more challenging. But winning the award is not supposed to
be about an individual actor's best role, but about the best role of
the year. Even by those standards, the odds look good. Eddie Redmayne
and Bryan Cranston are formidable, and Michael Fassbender is a
potential winner (even if he looks nothing like Steve Jobs). But did
anyone throw themselves in a role as deep as DiCaprio? Probably not.Tom Hardy, who plays the antagonist, is up for a supporting actor
award. By all means, he deserves it. His devilish Fitzgerald is every
bit as good as DiCaprio's Glass, and in some ways even more fun to
watch. He is a morally reprehensible monster. But the competition in
this category is a bit steeper because of a very unlikely opponent:
Sylvester Stallone. Few people would consider Stallone a great actor,
but he is getting many accolades for "Creed". He also has another
factor on his side: the subjectivity of Oscar voting. The voters will
often vote less on the individual roles and sometimes on an actor's
career, especially later in their life. This could be Stallone's chance
at a lifetime achievement Oscar. So, hardy deserves to win, but he is
not guaranteed by any means.There are a handful of nominations in makeup, costume and production
which could get a win. One of the strongest aspects of the film,
though, is Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. This is a tough category,
because you have the incredible Roger Deakins and a bold 70mm look on
"Hateful Eight". But Lubezki is right now the man to beat. He has eight
nominations to his credit, and has won the last two years (for
"Gravity" and "Birdman"). And, frankly, this might be his best work
yet. There are some long fight scenes that are reminiscent of Seamus
McGarvey's work in "Atonement" (2007). Could Lubezki win three years in
a row? Could be.All that praise aside, there is one category that the nomination was
quite wrong: Best Visual Effects. The film has a notorious bear-mauling
scene. And while the effects are quite good, there is never any doubt
that the bear is a computer simulation. A very nice one, but still fake
just the same. And that may take the audience out of the movie a bit,
as this otherwise excellent look at the wilderness has a very modern
image of a bear transposed in it... This award may end up going to
"Star Wars" regardless, as it tends to be the category for awarding
movies otherwise not considered Oscar-worthy.In short: is this DiCaprio's best role? Yes. Also possibly Tom Hardy's
best role. And some excellent cinematography. Movie of the year?
Perhaps, or perhaps not.

A movie like "The Revenant" isn't for everyone. This incredible, long
cinema experience demands your attention to truly appreciate what
director Alejandro G. Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki
have just accomplished. And my god  what a feat."The Revenant" is inspired by true events depicted in the early 1820s
of an enduring journey through the eyes of Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio). Glass and his men, featuring John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy),
Bridger (Will Poulter) and Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson),
were tracking animals for their pelts when a hoard of Native Americans
encountered the crew to steal the pelts for trade with the French. The
crew is forced to float down river by boat then ditch it according to
Glass' expertise. Fitzgerald doesn't care for this strategy and fears
for his life from the harm of the Native Americans that are chasing
them.Glass wanders off and gets viciously mauled by a bear in one of the
most horrifying scenes ever recorded in film, which truly triggers our
fight or flight sense  and we're just sitting in a chair. Glass' crew
moved on and left him for dead, on the account of Fitzgerald's orders.
Glass struggled with every move he made, crawling and later forced to
float in freezing rivers to safety. Battered and almost torn apart, he
strives to fight for revenge not only for himself, but for his boy."The Revenant" demands your respect for the accomplishment this film
has achieved. It is brilliantly shot by Lubezki using only natural
light, and during the bleak Canada winter, that light is only available
for a few hours a day. The film has been picked up and dropped a few
times because of the harsh conditions the film called for  which ended
up taking around nine months to shoot. A green screen was never used
during the process. Iñárritu told The Hollywood Reporter, "If we ended
up in green screen with coffee and everybody having a good time,
everybody will be happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of
s***."The film features some of the most beautiful landscape and tracking
shots you'll ever see in cinema. One can almost feel the freezing
temperatures and the warm sun peeking through the trees in the theater.
It's reported that a large number of the crew were fighting off
hypothermia and frostbite during the time of filming.DiCaprio is astounding on every level. One can see and feel the effort
given to truly capture what it was like to be in Hugh Glass' skin. He
called it "the most difficult film I've ever done," and one will know
exactly what he meant when you feast your eyes on it. The ferocity, the
commitment, the emotion  it's all there in equal form. He ate raw
bison liver, slept in an animal carcass and allowed us to feel what
it's like to be mauled by a bear with incredible choreography. He
doesn't have a ton of dialogue, but remember  that's not all it takes
to give a brilliant performance. In regards to the muteness, Iñárritu
said "the essence of cinema. Not to rely on the words, but images and
emotions." The cliché "a picture is worth a thousand words" applies
here. Don't discount DiCaprio's performance for lack of dialogue. It
simply does not matter.Hardy gave a powerful performance, as well. His southern dialogue was
hard to pick apart, but impressive nonetheless. His talent to be
ruthless truly shines in "The Revenant." Hardy can play smalltime when
it calls for it, but when given the opportunity, he proves he's just as
good as anyone else. Gleeson and Poulter were also strong in their
supporting roles."The Revenant" is a painful, emotionally draining film to get through,
but it's just as beautiful as it is brutal. Intensity will flow through
your body and you will be shaken up upon departure. It will be
remembered as a brilliant cinema experience for years to come.Also  it's Leo's year. He will finally get the Oscar.Check out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!

Before I address the question on everyones mind regarding the Oscar
that DiCaprio craves I have to talk about the on form director,
Alejandro G. Iñárritu, and his latest masterpiece. Last year he swept
up completely with 3 personal nominations and 3 wins for Birdman and
rightfully so. This year he is up for another 2 and if he was to win
them both he would be only the 2nd person to win back to back Best
Picture awards (The first was David O. Selznick in 1939 & '40) and the
3rd to win Best Director back to back (John Ford 1940 & '41 and Joseph
L. Mankiewicz 1949 & '50). He would however be the very first to do
both... But could it happen!? Well, firstly I have to say that any film that is able to put you in
amongst the action as fluidly and emotionally as is exampled in the
opening scene here is fully worthy of a best picture, the best film
that I have seen do it was Children of Men in 2006; rather
unsurprisingly a film by a friend of Iñárritu Mr Alfonso Cuaron and
also the same man in charge of the cameras Emmanuel Lubezki (The second
man to win best Cinematography back to back (He could win a 3rd) along
side John Toll). Of course, doing it once in the film really isn't good
enough but the fact that it is done more or less constantly throughout
the film is exceptional in itself. The opening scene I mentioned is a
surprise attack by the Indians on our protagonist and his party, which
travels like its one take and has you jolting at every bullet and arrow
that hits home. A fully deserved nomination for the above mentioned
Cinematographer. But the stand out point for me in this scene was how
brilliantly the sound accompanied the visuals and thats not the Score,
its the sound effects that feel as though they are happening around
you. Brilliant! The minimalistic score is used nicely to overpower the
end of the scene and carry us into the next one. All of these elements
are under the supervision of the director who I will now say has to
make all of this seem seamless and he truly does so. With that in mind
the Oscar could indeed be his (But i haven't seen all the other
nominees yet). As soon as this scene was over I knew that I was in for a mesmerising
experience similar to what I had with Birdman. Not that they are
similar. In fact these films are in many ways mirror opposites. Where
Birdman was fast, expressive and imaginative, this is patient, quiet
and real. The scene that this film will be remembered for is the
Grizzly Bear attack and it really is a shocking and very realistic
watch as it happens, seemingly, in 1 take and goes on for at least 5
minutes. The fact that you are sat there at this point almost able to
feel the pain he is in is something that must be seen to be believed.
The story that follows is just about the mother of all revenge stories,
as a true western should be, but also a survival film unlike any seen
before it. Tom Hardy, once again playing the villain can proudly take his Oscar
nomination to further springboard his already high flying career; Will
he win? Maybe! He's had a fantastic year though, starring in 2 films in
the best picture category playing the hero in one and the villain in
the other shows his brilliance. Now... Leonardo DiCaprio... Will he win the Oscar this time? I honestly
feel, just my opinion, that the argument suggesting that he should have
won one by now is unreasonable because he had been up against some very
formidable opposition over the years all of which were worthy winners
that he simply wasn't able to outshine. The only one I feel he should
have won for was Blood Diamond but was beaten by Forest Whitaker in a
career defining performance. The same with Jamie Foxx as Ray. His other
performances, albeit very good, weren't ground breaking or really in
any films that merit the kind of Oscar best picture winners with
weighty subject matter. But also he is the grounded actor in the room
which allows for actors around him to experiment and test the water
because they know Leo is there as the anchor. The other thing is that
if he had have won previously would he have changed the kind of films
that he makes? its not an unreasonable thought. However, this time he has a very physical performance that is given a
silence and demands a visceral understanding but also he and all the
actors are almost always right in the cameras face... I mean that very
literally. There are a few times when Leo's heavy breathing causes
condensation on the lens and it never spoils the effect. In fact it
makes you realise that the camera was literally a few inches away from
him whilst he's trying to perform and given that most of us find that
terrifying, for him to achieve this level of performance with that kind
of distraction deserves every kind of credit that can be bestowed. His
main competition this year is Michael Fassbender for Steve Jobs, 2 very
different performances and 2 contrasting acting styles but in my honest
opinion DiCaprio will not walk away from the Oscars disappointed this
year. Its his to win. As for the film... Its a masterpiece. Excellent and unforgettable.

Very rarely do I feel compelled to write a review, however in this
instance I feel I should. Recently many films have been hyped up, raising the bar for my
expectations, only for them to limbo right beneath. The Revenant was
truly an exception, taking the bar to new heights. From the outset the visuals are stunning - the spectacular scenery is
married with a deep consideration for movement and cuts. Not so many
cuts as to overwhelm the viewer, but enough to capture the enormity of
the wilderness whilst also showcasing the cocktail of emotions
portrayed by the characters. This is all achieved without missing a
moment of the action. Any line-up with Di Caprio and Hardy is destined to please, but it was
the additional support of upcoming actor Will Poulter which added new
dimension to the movie. Whilst Di Caprio and Hardy sit on two opposite
ends of the 'morally sound' spectrum (by 1800's standards), it is
Poulter's character battling with his conscience between the action
that keeps the pace of the movie going.I shall leave my review there - all I can say is, the scenes you've
likely heard about WILL exceed your expectations, as will those you
haven't. Go see the movie - enjoy.

This 'can' has an interesting role in the movie. The boy grabs this
'can' in very first scene of the movie when REE attack their camp. Then
it goes to Leonardo. Leonardo loses it during the scene where French
soldiers celebrate and hang a REE. Then Leonardo loses it during escape
scene. Then a French soldier carries the 'can' along with him to the
fort (as he goes there for shelter). At fort they come to know that
either Hawk or Leonardo are alive. So they go searching for him! And
the rest of the story we all know! Great Movie. Pure Art! The natural
scenes are amazing. It makes feel as if you are in that time period.
Acting is brilliant.

Firstly, I must state here that I was so confused about what the title
of my post should be because I could think of so many. It is the most
painful, hurting and brutal film that I have watched in my life. All of
it had such great realness to the film that it was impossible not to
feel Hugh Glass' pain and suffering, to the extent that I almost felt
like crying at some of the scenes. Leonardo's unbelievably awesome
performance has left me speechless. Hats off to such a brilliant actor,
wow!This film has involved my emotions like not many films have, and
reading that some of it was in fact inspired from true events has left
me struck (and most of my praise, if not all, obviously applies to the
book that this film is based upon). The realness of it made me reflect
on what life could turn out to be for some souls and what great trials
and ordeals life can demand from some people, and how fortunate we are
after all in life despite the constant complaining. Walking out of the
theatre, neither myself nor my brother-in-law could utter a word for a
good 10 minutes. There was this heaviness in the voice.The start itself was a dazzling one with that shoot-out, it made me
feel that we in for a good film, but then came the mauling from that
bear. Despite it being a film, I bet it couldn't have ever been more
real than this. It sent shivers down my spine, and the second time it
attacked him I literally felt his pain and utter humiliation. One of
the most terrifying scenes ever!Then came the scene that was personal to me to the extremes; when they
leave Hugh alone to die in the forest. Now, this is not the first time
someone was abandoned in a film, but the injuries had so much hindered
his physical movement that he was completely dependent on others' help.
Despite facing so much in life bravely and with a smile on my face, and
it is something that my family members often laugh about, it is an
established fact that right from my childhood days my biggest fear has
always been being left alone (and this fear developed after an incident
in childhood). I can't bear it, never can! For example, if my father is
alone at home with me, he has to first alert me even going to the
balcony and has to return within a given time frame. So adding that
personal touch to it, coupled with the earth shattering scene of his
son being murdered before his eyes, and then not even being able to
tell due to the temporary loss of speech caused by the injuries, it
almost made me cry.Then we proceed to his survival, which is perhaps an even more touching
part of the film. He crawls, he fights, he eats things that we might
end up vomiting by the mere thought of it, he sleeps "In the horse"
(yes, that is literal, not metaphorical in any sense!), and reaches his
people, takes his revenge. Every scene of it deserves an essay written
on it. Amidst all this, the cinematography deserves a special mention.
This film is scenic beauty and contains awesome pictures of mountains,
streams, trees, and of course, the relentless snow! It added a perfect
mix to the story and wonderful performances."As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe... keep
breathing." This is brilliant, and in every way inspirational and a
lesson for anyone struggling in his life. There's nothing more
beautiful than your own life, therefore fight to keep it. It is your
very existence, and once gone it won't return. Somehow, these quotes
sounded better and more powerful in the language that he spoke and
reading these lines translated on the screen felt more catching to the
memory.It is, again, one of the most unique films that I have watched in my
life. Since it felt so real, what I watched yesterday was not a film.
It was reality, or in better words, the brutal aspects of reality. I
have so many things to say about the film... I am eagerly waiting to
talk to her tomorrow on Skype and tell her the details of a once in a
lifetime cinema experience.

When I walked into the theater my first thought was that it was warm.
It was full of men and women sitting in chairs not knowing what to
expect from this movie. By the time it started I forgot the feeling of
warmth and was sucked into this film. The Revenant (R) starring Leonardo DiCaprio (Glass) and Tom Hardy
(Fitzgerald).It has been awhile since I wanted a film to win all of the awards that
it is nominated for, but this is one of them. The directing was spot
on, never have I been so wowed and gut wrenched like I was here. Seeing
the bear maul Glass was one of the most intense scenes I've seen in a
long time. The lighting in this movie was beautiful, see those
mountains and rivers in natural light really added to the immersion of
this film, by the mid point of this movie I felt like I was as cold as
the character Glass. Leonardo DiCaprio was a perfect choice for this
film, he really brought all he could give to this role, I really felt
the pain he must have felt when (Spoiler) His son died (End Spoiler). I
must also give a round of applause to Tom Hardy who played Fitzgerald.
He really made the character an asshole, which he was suppose too, he
also gave the character a really good accent with a few lines that did
sound a little bit like Bane. Now this film is not for the sake of fun, it is a very dark and
gripping movie. There are many intense and brutal death scenes that
will make you feel uneasy, but that my friends is a good thing, for a
movie to make me feel sick at the sight of violence is good. This film
is also very gory and full of blood, some of that gore comes from
(Spoilers) when Glass finds the Native who helps him back to health and
feeds him bloody buffalo, another scene is the confrontation between
Glass and Fitzgerald. (End Spoiler)Although this film was very entertaining I felt that it went on a tad
bit to long and that some of the scenes at the mid point could have
been taken out, and I also think Glass could have used more lines but
all in all I really recommend this film, it has a gripping story, some
great characters and for the first time in awhile a good January movie.I give The Revenant a 9/10

This movie has such a strong pulling effect that the moment it starts
you feel like physically dragged into the woods accompanying the hero
on his long, agonizing way to find the man who hideously killed his
son. The eye of the beholder or more precisely, the camera is smoothly
flowing around the characters and often comes so close to them that the
lens gets fogged by their breath, it's almost "pornographic" in terms
of how close the director wants to show us everything so that you feel
the urge to look away, the blood, the sweat, it's literally palpable,
the pain the hero must have sustained while being lacerated by a huge
bear you're able to feel on your own skin, it's simply awe-inspiring.
Sometimes it appears as if there are no cuts like it's happening in
real time, extraordinary!Inarritu once again proved that he is a visionary cinematographer and a
true artist on par with Terrence Malick just (luckily) more grounded in
linear story telling, the style never overlaps the substance like it
was the case with Malick's "Tree of Life" where you could get lost in
imagery. Sure the story itself is rather simple, it's about survival
and revenge, more or less typical blockbuster themes,"The Revenant"
could easily have turned into a second "Rambo" or Liam Neeson fighting
wolves in the wilderness, yet it became an ambitious and authentic epos
with a kind of documentary and simultaneously artistic approach and a
pulsating score.I'm not sure whether all this panting and screaming by DiCaprio is more
challenging and therefore worthier of an Oscar than let's say his
brilliant performance of a complex character like Howard Hughes in
"Aviator" for example which means that he should already have gotten
one as he is a fabulous actor, Tom Hardy as his treacherous antagonist
played a slightly more diverse character and was slightly more
interesting so that he definitely should get the Oscar for the Best
Supporting Role."The Revenant" playing in a snow covered wilderness will make you
shiver with cold for exactly the right reasons as it is a masterpiece.

Only one year after his major Oscar win with "Birdman", Alejandro G.
Inarritu delivers another awesome cinematic experience with his
survival western drama "The Revenant". Most of the publicity
surrounding this film is about whether or not this will finally gain
Leo his first Oscar. But there's so much more to this film. And Leo is
not even the star of this movie - even though he's terrific in it, I'll
come to that - but the real star is sitting behind the camera. It's
cinematographer Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki.I'd like to say that the art of cinematography has reached perfection
with "The Revenant", at least it has reached its peak up to now.
Chivo's images approach Nature as something elemental, terrifying, yet
painfully beautiful. It does not comment on these images, it does not
judge, it is rather something that is felt than intellectually
explored. Of course we have the long uncut shots that Chivo is already
famous for, but the dogmatic restriction to solemn use of natural
lighting comes off as even more incredible here. The movie has been
chided for its brutality, but it never uses that unnecessarily. It is
rather a realistic approach to the hard life in the Northwestern parts
of North America in the early 1800s.Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a stellar performance as Hugh Glass, the
protagonist who is trying to survive on his own in the wilderness
although being severely wounded. It is rather a physical performance
that he shows without any subtleness, but as an acting tour de force it
is overall extremely respectable. Tom Hardy excels as his counterpart
John Fitzgerald, a cold-hearted pragmatist who has his own methods for
survival. To me, he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for that
performance.The only issue I have with this movie is with some of the directorial
choices made by Inarritu. In my opinion, it would have been the perfect
film if it had been linear from beginning to end - just a straight,
gritty western that is always in the moment and in the wilderness.
Instead, Inarritu continuously breaks the scheme by integrating
flashbacks and dream sequences, which come off as quite
impressionistic. Those impressionistic elements bothered me, as they
slowed down the pace of this (overall too long) movie and distracted
from the movie's greatest strength: the Man vs. nature elements. But
after all, this is an incredibly beautiful work with superb acting and
the best camera work I've ever seen.

I give the Revenant 8 out of 10 stars on here. That's good, but not
great. It is definitely a must see film of the year as this may finally
be DiCaprio's first Oscar victory, and because it is quite an
experience. While it is definitely a "good" film, it falls short of
greatness due to a rather boring opening ninety minutes (except for a
few short scenes) and a sort of lack of explanations for certain
behaviors of its' characters. This is not a criticism because what it
does present us does suffice, but simultaneously I felt like I would
have liked to have gotten to know the other characters a little bit
more, particularly the son and the chief of the village who goes to
hunt for Fitzgerald at the end. Also, the beginning opening is rather
confusing as it is hard to tell who is who and what is what, and why
this is happening, despite a nice action opening.All that being said, I was not disappointed and would definitely
recommend this movie. It is sort of a like a Castaway meets The Grey
meets Dances With Wolves? Either way, it definitely deserves some award
recognition. It won't be for everybody mostly due to the boredom that
stems from so much time with nothing happening and the length, but if
you can stick with it, it is definitely a good film. In all honesty, I
found myself rooting for Leo most of the film toward the end: "Come on
DiCaprio, don't mess this up. Nail all your lines and facial
expressions. Get this Oscar. Come on, don't mess up! You can do it. Get
your Oscar"..

The Revenant is a story of survival at it's finest, showcasing the
brutality of human nature in life or death situations. This is not a
film for the faint of heart as director Alejandro G. Iñárritu takes
this violent and unforgiving story head on and doesn't let up until the
end credits roll. That's not to say this film doesn't have it's subtle
moments. There's plenty of time to catch your breath and take in the
beauty that surrounds the darkness. However, every time things look up
for the story and our characters, the ground crumbles at their feet
causing everything to come crashing back down.The film follows Hugh Glass, a frontiersman on a fur trading expedition
in the early 1800s. After an incredible opening battle sequence, the
story takes off when Glass is brutally attacked by a grizzly bear while
out on the hunt. One of the most realistically violent and jaw dropping
scenes in recent memory, this attack sets in motion a series of events
that cause great pain and anguish for the character, striking
relentlessly at his spirit and will to survive. In arguably his best
performance to date, Leonardo DiCaprio was the perfect actor to portray
the character in all of his pain, loss and misery. His performance was
so gritty and realistic that it was hard to watch at times giving the
illusion that these things were really happening to a real human being.
Combine that with the brilliant cinematography of Emmanuel "Chivo"
Lubezki and you get an unforgettable experience rarely achieved in
cinema.Throughout the film, you experience Glass' hardships hand in hand,
feeling his pain. None of this made easier by Tom Hardy's John
Fitzgerald. Hardy plays the villain to perfection as Fitzgerald jumps
on a chance to collect a payday by looking after the injured Glass.
None too excited about sitting around in the freezing cold watching a
man slowly die, he takes matters into his own hands to speed up the
process. Using the phantom threat of hostile Native Americans to scare
his partner Bridger (Will Poulter) into fleeing, the two of them leave
Glass for dead and rejoin their group. This leaves Glass to overcome
his dire situation on his own and face the unforgiving forces of nature
that surround him. DiCaprio's performance and Iñárritu's vision are at
the helm for the duration of the film and are also what will stay with
you long after the experience is over.9/10

First off I'm a big Dicaprio fan and was hoping to see an Oscar-worthy
performance out of him heading into this film. I expected the
cinematography and directing to be excellent and I wasn't disappointed
- I'd say this film is definitely worthy of an Oscar in both of those
categories. Was Leo's performance strong enough to earn him his first
win? I think so. It takes incredible artistry and talent to bring a
character to life with very little dialogue. We the audience experience
the character of Hugh Glass mostly through Dicaprio's facial
expressions and body language as he navigates and endures the most
brutal of realities. Dicaprio displays utter vulnerability and
commitment to his craft in this film. I never really consider going to see a movie twice, however the sheer
beauty of this film...we the viewers are literally sucked into this
Arctic landscape right from the beginning...makes it an enjoyable
experience in and of itself. One of my critiques though is that the movie does seem to drag in the
second half. I'm also a little disappointed in how the revenge
narrative played itself out in the movie...a little too straightforward
and predictable for my liking. I think this movie showed it's strengths
in other ways. Apart from its cinemagraphic brilliance, there were a
lot of other side narratives that took place as Dicaprio's character
journeyed along. These narratives seemed to have an intentional depth
to them that made the movie so much more than just a revenge story and
brought that entire place and time to life.I think the last shot of the movie was also appropriate. The movie had
a certain cadence that carried on from beginning to end. Tempo seemed
to be important, and it left me feeling somewhat calm upon its
conclusion.

An experience that finds you shivering throughout the whole film, The
Revenant will turn any theater into the cold harsh wilderness of 1823.
This is a film that puts viewers on the edge of their seats through
most of its two and a half hours. Taking place in a land where danger
lurks around any corner, and sleeping with one eye open is key for
survival, The Revenant is an adventure only fit for those with a strong
heart. Left for dead, the fearless frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio) must go toe to toe with Mother Nature herself as he struggles
to survive the deadly winter elements of uncharted American territory.This was one of the few films of recent years that truly makes you
believe you are there watching the story unfold. Next time you want to
say you are having the worst day ever, just think about Hugh Glass and
what he had to undergo. With very few items on hand, every breath of
survival was fueled by nothing but revenge for the man who put him in
such a situation. A truly great performance by DiCaprio, viewers can
really believe the struggle that he endures throughout his treacherous
journey. Achieving the Golden Globe for best actor in a motion
picture-drama was well deserved. The primary antagonist (the human one)
John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) is due credit for his performance as well.
It is clear these two actors deliver on screen when you find yourself
rooting for Hugh to prevail, and hating every second Fitzgerald is
alive.Director Alejandro Iñárritu spends a good deal of time shooting the
surrounding environment. In most cases, this could cause the film to
seem as though it is dragging on, but not here. The Revenant is an
incredible viewing experience, showing the wintry remote conditions of
Canada and Southern Argentina. Part of this had to do with the film
being shot in all natural light. This typically isn't done due to
relying on the position of the sun and clouds, but it pays off as this
is one of the most beautifully shot movies of 2015.There is absolutely no shortage of heart pounding moments. The biggest
being the encounter with a grizzly bear (the primary non-human
protagonist). An incredibly impactful scene, it demonstrates the raw
power such a creature can have. This moment will induce your fight or
flight response as you are sitting in your soft, safe, theater seat.
What Iñárritu does so well in this, and other action sequences, is
shoot them in one continuous shot. Most other films will cut back and
forth between characters or movements, The Revenant does not. Viewers
will find that this puts more focus on the event as a whole, versus
just the few who are involved.The story was based on true events, which makes the movie inspiring,
but runs the risk of reducing its impact as many viewers might know how
the plot unfolds. However, even if you know how it concludes before
entering the cinema, The Revenant is brilliant in showing how Glass
struggles to reach that point. Though they partly explain why Glass is
in a certain mind state during the film, the dream sequences he has do
occur a little too much. Nearly every time Glass closes his eyes, he
has obscure visions. So for those aren't particularly fond of this type
of genre, it may seem somewhat boring, and these moments could highly
contribute to that.A magnificent feast for the eyes, The Revenant is absolutely one of the
best films of 2015. With stellar performances and cinematography, it
depicts just how resilient the human spirit can be. As a
recommendation, it is best to see this in the theater. So don't just
wait for it to come out on digital or DVD, get the most from this movie
by seeing it on the big screen. A strong Oscar contender in multiple
categories (and winning a few golden globes), The Revenant receives a
well deserved 8.5/10. (IMDB only allows whole numbers so between either
an 8 or 9, it deserves a 9).

I'd been excited to see The Revenant since I had first heard of it, and
when I'd heard that Alejandro G. Inarritu was in the directing chair
with the same cinematographer who did the marvelous camera work on my
second favorite film of all time, I was understandably pretty excited.
And while this wasn't better than that film, it was still a pretty
fantastic film over all, and the one that I'll be pining for in all
categories at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. Without spoiling the
film, the cold, intense and frankly brutal atmosphere is held from
start to finish, aided by every aspect of the film. The cinematography
is as strong as ever, and the performances are absolutely amazing. As
of now, DeCaprio's raw performance as Glass is my favorite over all
performance in an Inarritu film. The soundtrack was intense, and the
violence is some of the most brutal and challenging that I've ever seen
in a theater, being more horrifying and endlessly more meaningful than
much of the violence and scares that modern horror can deliver. If I
had to make a few small nitpicks, some scenes could be cut out
completely and the film wouldn't have been any worse. Some character
motivations are a bit sketchy, and occasionally snow or breath will fog
the camera up, but I'm not even sure if that last one is a criticism,
because it is not very normal to see such raw camera work in such a
high budget film. Over all, 9/10... go see this as soon as you can.

The cinematography in this film is truly stunning. Capturing the
elements was pivotal in this film and the way it has been portrayed
through the lens is breath taking. The Landscape shots are incredible
making the movie look and feel real. Very Strong Performances from Di
Caprio (Hugh Glass) and Hardy (John Fitzgerald) make the movie a must
see. Two scenes in particular I found to be epic. The bear attack scene as it was very realistic, everything the bear did
seemed instinctive and natural, whether it was the bear sniffing to see
if Glass was dead or standing on him to break his bones. This was the
first major event in the film which started Glass's struggle to
survive.The final fight scene was perfect in my opinion, nothing was over the
top.There was quite a long build up to the fight, which made it all the
more sweeter, it was truly a struggle for both men. With a perfect
revenge for Glass after what Fitzgerald did to him.Credit to Domhnall Gleeson (Andrew Henry) for a great performance in
another supporting role backing up his recent strong performance in The
Force Awakens. His career is reaching new heights as he explores
different roles.Overall I loved the cinematography and the sound effects, there was
never any doubt this blockbuster movie would deliver with this all star
cast.

I left the cinema with a deep satisfied feeling in my chest. The one
you have after an exhausting hike, or heavy swimming exercise. in this
case it was a deep satisfaction of my soul. The photography exposes
nature in such a deep way that it resonated with every cell in my body.The story is simple. No need for explanation. The acting is good but
not brilliant. The music is close to perfect and its timing and paste
is unearthly good. The film left me with an uneasy feeling - hence the rating, which is
not a 10. this movie is too perfect. The photography, the coloring and
the light are too perfect for a story that in it itself exposes the
roughness of nature and humankind. It does not fit; or you celebrate
roughness in your whole production or you don't. But not half. It's
like the director is not making a statement in one clear direction. He
over-exposes nature, lighting, color and most of all the sound. It
gives me the feeling he wants me to be dragged into that unforgiving
side of pure nature. He wants me to be 'dirty' myself by boosting up
all the parameters. But then....on the other side, he stays so....neat.
So clean. The images are so decently, obsessively....beautiful. The
sound-pallet is close to perfect... So, as a viewer, i feel tempted to jump into the rough dirtiness of
this story, but when i jump, fear, fight and survive.....and leave the
cinema.... I am still clean and neat. I miss.uncompromisingly dirtiness.

The production quality of this film is amazing: Locations, conditions,
editing, acting. It's a slow film, and conveys emotions. It takes you
into another world with crisp details and beautiful camera work.The flip side is that it leaves you feeling... empty? At least not
satisfied. Definitely not happy. This is a hero's journey, but he
doesn't reach redemption. He seeks after something, overcoming
adversity(!!) at every step, on sheer grit alone. But in the end he
reaches his goal, and you don't feel happy for him. It's hard to watch
a movie 2.5 hours long with the spanning visuals and locations- you
literally become part of the trip- and then not feel good at the end.
And the rub is that because it's such a BIG feeling film, the at best
neutral finish, or at worst negative finish is multiplied 10-fold. It
feels like a downer. It feels pessimistic.Again, there are plenty of positives to the film and I'd still
recommend it, but it's a hard journey to go on just for the sake of
seeing it.

I walked into the theater expecting a great film; somehow I got more.
The film from start to finish was beautiful, every shot could be framed
and put in to an art gallery. However, if the film was only a spectacle
for the eyes, then it is no more than the newest Transformer film.
Thus, obviously, the film was more. Although the plot was simple, a man
left for dead who seeks revenge on those who are responsible, there is
no moment in the movie where you will be bored. The audience remains
hooked and continuously roots for Hugh Glass (the protagonist of the
film) even as the odds of his survival become slimmer every second.
This is due to the captivating soundtrack, spectacular cinematography,
and of course stellar acting performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's
performance, although one with very little dialogue, is mesmerizing.
DiCaprio did not need to say any words, in fact, if he had it could
have made his performance silly by overacting. Instead, DiCaprio is
able to express his emotions with his physical performance. Tom Hardy
and Domhnall Gleeson also gave fantastic performances. Hardy taking a
role that was outside his comfort zone, the antagonist, and somehow
manages to own it. Another name that needs to be mentioned is Alejandro
González Iñárritu, who yet again delivers a film ahead of it's time. If
the Oscars go as they should, this should be that film that pisses off
all the other films because it is hogging all of the Oscars. Nine months of filming in remote wild environment, natural light, very
good cast and few CGI have produced an exceptionally good film. This is
an epic masterpiece and a real achievement of cinematography.

In most of his movies Alejandro G Innaritu has emphasized on human
behavior, relationship, conflicts between various characters and he
represented his movies in a non linear, hyperlink format. Amores
Perros, 21 grams and Babel are the three most prominent examples of his
cinematic style. He always has liked to reveal the whole story with
flashbacks, flashforwards and plot twists. But 'The Revenant' is an
exception of his usual format. Here he created situations in absolute
wilderness. It is a story of 'Struggle for existence' and survival with
inner current of vengeance, love and human values. He depicted the
survival strategies in one of the most hostile and extreme environments
with impeccable detailing, that is what makes the film a great
creation. Leonardo DiCaprio has done the best performance of his life.
a must watch.

The Revenant is a pretty good movie and I am glad i watched it.
However, in my opinion it is not a masterpiece. The movie has tons of
positive things, the really good camera, a very interesting and
different look, and, of course, very good acting. But I have to say
that I don't think it is Di Caprios best performance. This is just my
opinion, but I don't consider screaming and crying and making weird
faces as incredible acting. Di Capro has done much better in previous
films. What really stands out is the performance from Tom Hardy as
Fitzgerald. His Character is so interesting and fun and I liked the
scenes with him much more than Di Caprios. So, what else is important
to know is that this movie is not fun. It is very hard and cruel and
although the camera makes really good pictures of the nature, they are
not beautiful, but hard and cold and you really get the feeling of
being lost in this cruel world. This movie is obviously not for
mainstream audience. However, there are also a few weak things. My
biggest issue with the movie is that the story is in fact very simple
and kind of boring. The movie is very predictable and nothing
unexpected happens. That was a little disappointment for me and due to
this, I don't consider it as a masterpiece, but still a good movie. At
the end, I have to say that one scene in the movie is incredibly good.
The bear scene. Its is brutal and you do not want to look at the
screen, while always wondering "how did they film that?". It is so
intense and you should watch it on the big screen. However, after this
movie, i will probably never go into a forest anymore.

This movie was awesome it had everything you could want from it.
Multiple themes from the plot, great acting from Leo but really tom
hardy stole the show, thrill, intense action and battle scenes, and a
ton of gore sometimes too much to watch but it was awesome either way.
Multiple themes showing on what man is willing to do to survive the I
humane things that they may do. It has the base story of revenue after
being left for dead. And the multiple "turf" despite a between more
than one Native American tribe and Europeans and white Americans. These
disputes lead to gory intense battles that had some very disturbing and
almost scary scenes. The key to the action sequences in this movie was
the camera work. The camera angles were unbelievable making you feel as
if you were freezing in those terrible conditions fighting brutally
Native American tribes coming at you. This movie was very good and I
highly recommend you go see it with warning that is disgustingly gory
at times beyond your imagination. I believe Leo could get his Oscar for
this one.

Inspired by true events and Michael Punke's novel of the same name, The
Revenant captures one man's epic adventure of survival and the
astonishing power of the human spirit. In an expedition of the
uncharted American wilderness, renowned explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is brutally attacked by a bear and left for dead by members
of his own hunting team. In a quest to survive and guided by revenge
for his betrayers, Glass must endures life-threating injuries,
sickness, the harsh environment, hostile natives, and others to make
it, back to home. Can Glass navigate the cold & vicious winter in a
relentless pursuit to live and find redemption, or will this story of
the rural survivalist, end tragic? Watch the movie to find out, if you
really want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say,
the visuals in this film, has reaches a new level of remarkability.
It's a fully immersive, dimensional look, with jaw-dropping long takes
and strikingly physical realism. Filmed in the remote wilderness of
Canada and Argentina, the cinematography for this film, is one of the
main reason, why I really wanted to see this movie. Beautifully shot by
Emmanuel Lubezki and director Alejandro González Iñárritu, the film is
famous for using only natural light to highlight these amazing
set-pieces. Some of these tracking shots, were so complicated, due to
cold weather conditions, the remoteness of the locations and director
Alejandro González Iñárritu's strict aesthetic plan, that the film was
infamous for its trouble-some long production. Even season actors like
Leonardo DiCapiro and Tom Hardy, have stated out that this is one of
their hardest movies to shot. And yet all of the film's visually
arresting set-pieces would have been in vain had the viewer failed to
connect with the characters. Lucky for them, I found the main and
supporting characters to be very appealing. I was very invested in the
human element of this tale of survival and retribution. Both Leonardo
and Tom Hardy were astonishing in their roles; however, Tom Hardy's
performance as John Fitzgerald is definitely the better of the two
leads. I like the fact, that he's ruthless, greedy, tough and somewhat
scare. Still, I think the movie made Fitzgerald, seem like a
one-dimensional villain with him, killing his kid, than what was more
like, what was exactly from fur trappers, back then. Leonardo
DiCaprio's character in the movie, was the same. He seem a little too
super human, good-hearted and embellished to be taken as a real Hugh
Glass. Scenes like him, surviving a huge cliff drop and multiply
waterfalls was a little too unrealistic for my taste. In my opinion, I
think the movie would have a more realistic tone, if they kept, Hugh
Glass's account, closer to the real-life event. The film took too many
liberties. Unlike the movie, Hugh Glass didn't single-handed put down a
bear; he had help from fur-trader buddies. Plus, that event happen in
summer, not winter. Another thing, unlike the movie, which has Hugh
Glass swim, in ice-cold temperance water, most of the way, down the
river. In real-life, he make a crude raft and floated downstream. In my
opinion, it doesn't make sense that he swam, because of hypothermia.
Then, there was the ending, which I will not spoil, that I have mixed
feelings about. It was action-packed, but somewhat disappointing as
well. All, I have to say about it, is the 'Revenge in God's hand' arch
wasn't well-developed. Still, it was better than what happen in the
real-life account. Still, despite, the loose adapted of Hugh Glass's
account; DiCaprio's version does have more of the punishing feel;
because of that, it's more entertaining. Seeing Leo put himself truly
through the ringer for his art is worth-watching on its own. So he
deserves some credit. After all, it's pretty hard to do, all those
survival stunts, eat raw meat, speak two Natives language, and risk
hypothermia. Also, Leo's Glass' loneliness, desperation, bond with his
mixed race son, and painful memories all make him a sympathetic and
moving character, an all the more extraordinary, accomplishment given
how little dialogue DiCaprio has. Yet this movie is not a film for all
people. Some of the "Terrence Malick" style, symbolism was a bit off,
and confusing. It does comes off, as somewhat self-indulgent and
pretentious at times. Still, the movie is somewhat passable for its 156
minute run-time. While, the runtime is long, it's not as slow, as
certain critics, make it out to be. Overall: The utter ferocity of the
action and performances, added with the breath-taking visuals makes,
this survival epic, a must-watch from me. Check it out.

The Revenant could be just one more survival story, but Alejandro
Iñárritu directed a movie that can be described as a great cinematic
experience. I've really enjoyed its dark but beautiful atmosphere
created by director Alejandro Iñárritu and cinematographer Emmanuel
Lubezki (both Oscar-winning). The soundtrack just emphasizes it
perfectly. Outside of some brutal scenes, the movie is visually superb
and will take you to the beautiful landscapes of the Far West. You
should be ready for some extreme scenes of violence, though.Leonardo DiCaprio plays really great, but I'm afraid he won't win Oscar
for this one. His character simply doesn't require much acting and
resembles (to me at least) Tom Hardy's character in Mad Max (2015). No
doubt it was extremely physically challenging role, but it's not an
Oscar winning type. I would be glad to be proved wrong!Beside all of that, The Revenant remains an inspiring story of courage
and the unswerving determination to survive. A desire for vengeance
possibly shouldn't be the single reason to live, but in watching a
movie all my sympathies lie with Hugh Glass. When I learned that movie
is based on a real story from the 19th century, I was very impressed.Before The Revenant, I wasn't a huge fan of Iñárritu's, but now I'll
wait for his next movie.

I saw "The Revenant", starring Leonardo DiCaprio-Django Unchained, The
Quick and the Dead; Tom Hardy-Mad Max:Fury Road, Bane in The Dark
Knight Rises; Domhnall Gleeson-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, True
Grit_2010 and Will Poulter-The Maze Runner, We're the Millers.This movie is based on true events about a frontiersman named Hugh
Glass. The story was made into an earlier movie back in 1971 and it was
called 'Man in the Wilderness', starring Richard Harris. The director
of this movie is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who also directed
'Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance'. Revenant is a French
word, meaning to revert to spirit or ghost. The story takes place in
the 1820's, with Leo playing Hugh Glass, a guide for a group of fur
traders. Tom is one of the traders being led by Leo and Tom does not
like Leo and his son, at all. Believe it or not, it seems like there
was racism going on back in the old west. Leo has an Indian son from an
Indian wife-that has since passed away-that Leo uses as his assistant
guide and Tom just don't hanker to them. Domhnall is the leader of the
traders that is trying to raise money for his soldiers and some
settlers back home and Will is another trader in the team. After a bear
attacks Leo and leaves him in pretty bad shape-the attack or actually a
maul, looks realistically authentic-Tom leaves Leo and his son behind,
to die. Tom actually helps the son on his journey to meet his ancestors
in the happy hunting grounds, up in the sky. Leo crawls out of a
hastily dug grave and goes after his revenge. Along the journey, Leo
runs into other fur traders and Indians, falls off a cliff while riding
a horse and climbs inside a dead animal, just to keep warm-kind of like
what Luke Skywalker did. You gotta say one thing for him, he didn't
know the meaning of the phrase, 'Just give up'. It's rated "R" for
violence, gory images, language and sexual content- including nudity
and a sexual assault-and has a running time of 2 hours & 36 minutes. I
really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.

OK. Let me first say that I'm a huge fan of Leo's. He definitely
deserves an Oscar, but honestly not for this. The following is semi
spoiler.... The majority of his performance is him grunting, crawling,
screaming. I understand there have been performances that have won for
not really saying a word, however, there presence was more abundant
than Leo's. **Spoiler**After he is attacked, he is almost non existent.
Honestly, I got more from Tom Hardy's performance than Leo. I
understand that Leo endured a lot in this film, But so did Tom Hanks
for Cast Away. or Gabourey Sidibe for Precious. This is IMO a
consolation prize. The movie itself, I will say, is really boring. Aside from the bear
attack and the ending of the film nothing else happens except a
betrayal, left for dead, then OMG he's alive :-O, and a scene of Native
Americans trying to kill him, but it was literally one scene of that.
The cinematography, I will say, was really good. Maybe its trailer
suggested that there was to be more going on. But honestly there
wasn't. It really doesn't deserve Best Picture. Personally Mad Max or the
Martian were better movies.

The Revenant was one of those movies that got released in December and
then got a wider release in January. I walked into this movie last
night expecting nothing more than a good Leonardo Dicaprio film, but it
was a masterpiece. The last time i had this much fun at the movies was
probably back in 2012 when i saw The Dark Knight Rises. The overall
movie plot was Glass'(Leonardo) fight against mother nature, with the
desire to get his revenge after the murder of his son. The breathtaking
locations and forests throughout the movie and the beautiful
cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki all added up to make The Revenant a
visual poetry. The film had many fight scenes which were BRUTAL,
especially one that involved Glass and a Grizzly. Every actor in the
movie pulled a good performance and Tom Hardy was great as usual.
Leonardo Dicaprio at the age of 41 delivered yet another Oscar worthy
performance, making The Revenant without a doubt one of the best movies
of 2015.

Let me first start off with the technical skills, Leonardo's
performance etc. are remarkable to say the least.IMO this was just a
multi million, dollar, epic, revenge flick. Leo deserves an Oscar for
this considering what he must have endured. However, what we are
expected to believe in surviving , not just one, but two bear attacks.Another issue was distancing me from the reality of the film. There
were far too many camera lens fogging up . Why they used such close
lens's was a big mistake. When a bear gets right in front of the lens
for it's close up , why would they think it a good idea for the image
to fog up.Tom hardy still amazes me by his changing appearances in
everything he does. But what the hell accent was he trying to do.For me, this was equivalent to ,THERE WILL BE BLOOD, which I found as
boring as watching paint dry. It also suffers with the same lack of
musicality which is Nonexistent. In short there is no way any human
could survive such torture.AS bored as I was it will grab picture and actor which is deserving.

This is a great movie with a extraordinary and simply brilliant
performance by Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy. We really feel the
cold and the struggle of the nations to survive in this hard century. This is a must see to not only for the beauty of the images but for
this story based on true events. The fact that in was film in part in
Canada make me proud to see these amazing shots and the nature in that
perspective.The Golden Gloden for best actor and the Golden Golden for the best
movie were highly deserve. Hoping to see this movie at the Oscar in the
same categories.

The Good - Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's commitment to realistic gritty
filmmaking. The film is greatly elevated by the decision to use natural
lighting and the elements. The cinematography is spot on and holds your
attention during every shot. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy's superb
performances as well as a solid all-around supporting cast. A few
visual effects scenes that are amazing. The Bad - Very difficult to find anything wrong with this film but if I
would have to choose anything it would be the runtime. It did feel a
little drawn out in certain parts of the film.The Ugly - Absolutely nothing.

The Revenant is one of the most anticipated movies for me of 2015. From
the first to the last trailer that was released i got more and more
excited to see Leonardo back on the big screen. A lot of my excitement
came from the fact that this movie looked ambitious and unique and i
think Hollywood needs to take more risks like this film as. I'm just going to start by saying this is one of the most intense,
riveting, and breathtaking movies I have ever seen. I can't think of a
movie that made me sit at the edge of my seat as much as this one. From
the beginning you are submersed into this brutal world that doesn't let
you sit back and relax. This movie is man vs nature at its finest. Yes,
it is a revenge tale, and yes people do die, but the environment that
these people live in never gives them a break and no time to let their
guard down. It's cold, it's harsh, and it's dangerous. The costumes and
makeup are incredible. I was constantly cringing, while i looked at
Leonardos characters wounds. They sure made all the characters in this
film rough looking, and as they should for this time period. Some of the most incredible things about this film, is by far the
cinematography and the sound design/mixing. Visually this movie is a
masterpiece. I say this because i've never seen a movie with this style
of filming. It's unique and refreshing to watch, especially because
their is not a lot of innovation when it comes to unique style in
cinematography. The sweeping, continuous shots that go on and on are a
Emmanuel Lubezkis trademark and they work beautifully. The absence of
music for a lot of the movie and the sound of the falling snow, or the
wind rustling the trees, or water flowing down the river is absolutely
beautiful. For some of the scenes, even if you close your eyes and
listen, you get the sense of where this film takes place. This movie is one the greats, yes the bear looked a little weird, and
it was a little long, but when you sit back a think about what these
film makers have accomplished, it is truly amazing. They pulled me into
this world didn't let me out until the final credits starting rolling.
I got up, took a deep breath and said "wow." It's refreshing to watch a
movie that takes risks and when it pays off it turns out to a movie to
remember. I'll be looking out for this movie at the Oscars.Pros: -Beautiful cinematography -Amazing sound design -Simple yet
compelling story -Man vs Nature -Strong Cast -Setting Cons: -Could tell the bear was CGI -A little longRating: 9.3 out of 10

OK. So, this is pretty much how I went from thinking this is
PHENOMENAL, to somewhat average and, a bit, forgettable.*SPOILER ALERT*Once Tom Hardy's character finds out towards the end, that Leo is still
alive, I began to fear the worst! "Oh no.. please, don't do this". But
I assured myself, this, thus far encapsulating, political, complex,
cinematic experience would not, could not, give way to that *yawnable*
ending that I SO desperately try (so very hard) to avoid.But I was wrong.Why did this movie fall victim to the predictable formula that most
hero/villain movies follow?Don't get me wrong! I loved the overall production, soundtrack, and the
acting was certainly A grade in my book !!!But.... why? WHHHHHHYYYY? I settled on an 8 , even though i'm pretty ticked off the story itself
may not even deserve a 7..What do you think?

(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended. In brief: Some action scenes do impress, but the filmgoing experience
becomes more arduous than needed. GRADE: BVengeance is a sweet and powerful impulse that keeps our protagonist
alive in Alejandro G. Iñárritu's sprawling Western saga, The Revenant.
Based on a true account of frontiersman Hugh Glass (a superb Leonardo
DiCaprio), the film shows his violent journey homeward. Faced with
natural obstacles, man-made treachery, Native American hostilities, and
a horrifying bear attack, our pioneer fights for his life every moment
on his trek through the wilderness. Left for dead by members in his
hunting party, his grueling endurance test becomes one for the
moviegoer as well as we face hardship after hardship in bloody
realistic fashion.￼The onslaught may not make for comfortable viewing, but the artistry
and virtuoso filmmaking on display is exhilarating to behold, even if
the screenplay by the director and Mark L. Smith is one long series of
strung together perils with not much in the way of strong character
development (other than Glass himself), memorable dialog, or detailed
plotting. The story itself is a typical survival tale, rote and
predictable, with more than a touch of Terrance Mallick's inspiration
and spiritualism thrown in with some cloying (but lovely) ethereal
dreamscapes and hallucinations marring the action. Also, the film takes
some liberties with the historical facts, especially in the fictional
climax of the film.But the artistry by the director, actors, and behind-the-scenes crew is
remarkable in their achievements and dedication. Iñárritu is a
visionary director, setting up the many action sequences and
positioning his actors to get the maximum effect from his unique point
of view. (The actual making of this film must have been demanding with
his on-location filming in the mountainous regions of Canada.) Shot
under frigid conditions, the film has an authenticity that makes the
movie all the more riveting with images that truly astound and leave
one gaping at its brutality and beauty. The film is a visceral
experience but it never touches the mind or heart. It is technically
astute and emotionally aloof. (One false note, literally: The dissonant
music by Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto, and Bryce Dessner, which has a
mysterious and haunting quality, tends to telegraph the ominous
approaching danger the minute any chord is sounded.)Still, one cannot gush enough about the glorious panoramic wintry
vistas and fluid camera-work of the gifted Emmanuel Lubezki. His wide
angle shots and striking close-ups are exceptional as is the brilliant
editing by Steven Mirrione. The movie-going audience is placed directly
in the line of fire as arrows fly, bullets whiz by, and blood flows.
Whenever the action starts, we are swept away into its powerful spell.￼Mr. DiCaprio gives a consummate performance as Glass. The role is
subtly portrayed, mostly silent and intrinsic in its character, as this
man battles his way suffering one misfortune after another. The misery
shows in the actor's facial expressions and stance most effectively.
This physically demanding role should send many awards his way as
compensation. Providing strong support are Tom Hardy as his rival,
Fitzgerald, and Domhnall Gleeson as his dutiful friend. ￼While not for those who have a low tolerance of pain and violence, The
Revenant is must-see viewing for any serious film-goer for its
technical expertise and the fully committed performance by Mr.
Dicaprio. The awe and wander is there, just not the necessary wonder. Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com

Leo has done it again with a bone chilling performance, literally. I
was getting cold as some of the scenes in this movie unfolded. Utterly
amazing at the stuff this man can do. The Cast was overall spectacular!Tom Hardy was a very convincing
villain, although personally its hard for me to hate him in any role
because he is such a good actor. Domhnall Gleeson was awesome and is
going to be a bright talent for future movies to come. The annoying kid
from The Maze Runner was good. All star cast. The Cinematography is amazing and it will be a top nominee for that
category. Not so much as of a revenge movie as it looks but more of a survival
movie and a damn good one at that! Superb Must SEEEEEEE!8.7/10

The Revenant isn't like most westerns that have very straightforward
moral dilemmas and are fun tones, it is dark, and it is complicated.
The Revenant is a movie with a lot of backstories that makes, it even
more impressive than it already is, and it is impressive. The Revenant
is brilliantly acted, features beautiful cinematography all the while
showing deep narrative heft. The film is poised to receive major awards
attention, and rightfully so.The first piece of back story surrounding this film is fairly well
known, and that is that Leonardo DiCaprio is still fighting for his
first Oscar. After seeing this film, it seems safe to say that his
performance is Oscar worthy. DiCaprio carries the movie as long
stretches of the film feature DiCaprio alone, acting in an isolated
surrounding, which is even harder to do. DiCaprio often balances
soft-hearted empathy and stone-cold revenge within small stretches, and
every emotion is well accentuated. While the focus is on DiCaprio,
because he's the cornerstone of the film, Tom Hardy and Domhall Gleeson
are also brilliant in this film as well.Another piece of back story that may not be as well known is that
Director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu and Cinematographer Emmanuel
Lubezki decided to shoot the entire film with nothing but natural
light. To go a little deeper, considering exposure and reciprocity this
gave the filmmakers only a few hours to shoot per day in order to get a
good exposure. Even more impressive is that the film is stunningly
gorgeous, and by that I mean that the film looks professionally lit,
despite the use of no lighting. This is Lubezki's third consecutive
cinematography masterpiece, and he'll probably end up winning his third
consecutive Oscar for cinematography.The other impressive aspect of the film is the story. Most westerns
tell straightforward stories, with simple characters (good guy vs. bad
guy), that's not bad it's just easier to follow. The Revenant mixes
traditional western conventions such as the use sweeping panoramic
vistas, and the typical setting, but has far more complicated and
deeper characters. All of the characters in this film are relatable
because their motivations are easy to follow, just not always pleasant.
The end result of the realistic character development is that the story
is far more realistic and thus thought provoking.In conclusion, The Revenant is brilliantly acted, and may be the film
to finally get Leonardo DiCaprio his much awaited Oscar win. The film
is beautifully shot and will, more than likely, win the Best
Cinematography Oscar. The story is uncompromising, and graphic when it
needs to be. For those who love artistic films, this is right up your
alley, and for those who love westerns, you'll probably enjoy it too.

this was a terrific film that repeats often chronicled reports that
people can survive a terrific amount of weight falling on them,for
instance in a car crash,where the driver is pinned under a 3,000
lb.metal paperweight. Although,it is easy to believe you can kill a
bear w/ one bullet,& several knife wounds(I read somewhere that Alaskan
Kodiak bears can reach 8' tall standing);I never imagined a film would
show a person almost getting killed from the dead carcass he killed
landing on top of him,after collapsing & falling down a
ravine(?).Despite all the long beard, I instantly recognized him as Leo
diCaprio,but could not figure out who the villain was underneath all
that makeup hair & the southern, pre -civil war speech vernacular(it
was that same guy who plays those British gangsters,Tom Hardy!).THere
were so many pithy, aphorisms he said(will have to return & see film a
2nd time to write them all down), I thought that Inarritu had hired
Ralph Peters as a dialogue coach!(CAIN AT GETTYSBURG@2012); I also
thought this is a very good film,in the model of many Hollywood
westerns about "Lewis & Clark Expedition" type adventures about
explorers tracking the western Frontier & confronting bloodthirsty
indians,etc.,in showing the types of wardrobe that John Richardson &
Glass wore,the typical long bore weapons, the type of diet,(it looked
like diCaprio caught a live fish & bit into it?,i dunno,it sure looked
like it!); Also, this is described as a revenge movie,so I impute that
to mean,diCaprio is trying to find the ones(Hardy) that done him wrong.
All in all,I rate this a 10 out of 10,the Bear should get an honorary
Oscar for all the shaking he did of diCaprio's body, I thought he was
going to eat him alive,but then the bear seemed to just walk on top of
him to lick his face....?More civil war aphorisms(an aphorism is a concise way of describing a
depressing truth?)>> '.that sounds like pissing in the whiskey jug'=(a
used car salesman, or a tin horn politician speaking out of the side of
his mouth,or similar 2-faced obtuse person)>>' a blessed person who
hides behind a curse.....=not quite sure what this aphorism in the book
meant)>> I would think that 10 minutes being devoured by a bear would
easily substitute for 3 horrific days in the summer of 1863 (battle of
Gettysburg); I cannot believe I live in the same country as where the
battle of Gettysburg was fought,it makes me feel very
insignificant,like diCaprio walking through the frozen tundra of this
wonderful movie...>>

The Revenant is not a common movie which you can watch for amusement.
It has a deeper idea, a very reflective intention, than being a movie
itself.Honestly, with the amazing visuals which bring this movie to life, made
me question myself our very existence. This is so, due to the indirect
importance of human-beings in harmony but also in chaos ( this is a
paradox) with the astonishing wilderness. Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy vanish into the flesh and blood of Hugh
Glass and John Fitgerald respectively, two rivals which develop their
hatred throughout the movie. No need to say this because you may already have seen this in the
trailer; stupendous sound effects, make-up and picture.The main plot points are survival and vengeance due to human ignorance
and selfishness which lead to betrayal and take the downward spiral to
death. It is more of a survival-themed movie because most of the
running time you see Hugh Glass cling for his life. Vengeance is only
emphasized here and there , and it is conquered at the end of the
movie.Life; death, beauty; sorrow, self-indulgence; selflessness ... This
movie, in a deep way is full of contradictory terms which make you
think. The Revenant movie is like a metaphor - two unlike terms
compared with each other - we see this every second in the movie :
nature ; which is beautiful and is full of life but it is cruel/harsh
and it can cause death.

Inarritu, award-winning director for "Birdman" has returned this year
to direct another masterpiece. The Revenant could easily return to win
awards for best motion picture of the year, best achievement in
directing, and best achievement in cinematography. Hardy performed
exceptionally well as the villainous Fitzgerald but Dicaprio stole the
screen as the protagonist Hugh Glass. Dicaprio deserves to win this
year for best performance by an actor in a leading role. The Revenant, inspired by true events, is about fur trapper Hugh glass
and his passion to live when all is lost. After being brutally
attacked, betrayed, and left for dead, Glass has two motives: survival
and revenge. The Revenant is gripping throughout the whole two and a half hour
runtime and will leave you breathless by the time you leave the
theater. With a mixture of exceptional acting, beautiful
cinematography, and rare directing, you cannot afford to miss this
movie. This is one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen
PERIOD. Do yourself a favor, fork out the $10.00 to see this unique
film, you will not regret it.

Right off of the bat, I'd like to say that the film has some of the
absolute BEST cinematography I've ever seen. I don't know how the
producers managed to get so many long-shots in there. There are
literally shots that will last 5 minutes without cutting in between.
This is especially true at the beginning. If anything, this film should
definitely receive tons of praise for its cinematography alone.
Hand-in-hand with the cinematography are the visual effects. Next to
the Martian, this film has some of the best visual effects that I've
seen this year. This is especially true with the bear mauling scene.
The bear literally looks real, and the manage to generate drool coming
from its mouth and landing on Leo's forehead, however, the bear was
never there in the first place. The effects looked gorgeous, and I
really enjoyed seeing them on the big screen. However, despite the great visual effects, and the stellar
cinematography, the film just wasn't up to my expectations. When I saw
that this film had 4 golden globe awards including best acting, I truly
expected to see a breath taking performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, but
I was greatly disappointed. Sure he did great job of acting like he was
in pain, and acting like he couldn't talk, however, this is nothing
that we haven't seen before. Even in low- budget films, we see acting
of a similar caliber where people are suffering for their roles. There
simply just wasn't enough lines for Leo to peak our interests or to
really steal the show. Leo spends most of his time on screen grunting,
screaming, and breathing super heavily. I'm sure that any other trained
Hollywood actor could pull this off too; his performance was very
bland.The other actors seemed very one-dimensional. There were some great
actors in this cast: Tom Hardy, Leo DiCaprio, Domhnall Gleeson,
however, I feel like the director spent most of his time on capturing
the environment rather than the actors of the film. Throughout the
film, I feel like the acting was done in one take. From the beginning
with the dispute between Glass and Fitzgerald, to the scene with
Fitzgerald and Glass' son. The performances given just seemed so
rushed, and I know for a fact the actors can do better. The director for whatever odd reason liked to put slow-motion in areas
that didn't need slow-motion. This is really shown in transitions back
into the wild. The running time is 156 minutes, and could have been
trimmed down to 140 minutes by getting rid of all of the unnecessary
slow-motion. Minute after minute, we see nothing but trees. Trees and
the moon. This really doesn't do anything for the audience but remind
us that we are in the cold weather. Which was kind of implied anyways.Overall, the film was visually appealing, but the acting was not great.
The talent in this movie was very much skimped for the excellent
cinematography and effects. The film was fun to watch, but nothing
ground-breaking, and unfortunately for his fans, I don't see Leo
getting his Oscar from this film.

The Revenant is a story of survival and retribution . If we take out
these thematic elements from the movie it still is a visual stunner .
The cinematography is spectacular , given the nature and conditions of
the climate in which the movie is shot. In fact weather is one of the
main protagonists in the this thriller . Another very important aspect of the movie is the raw depiction of
violence. It is in line with the raw depiction of the natural elements.
The bear-mauling scene is one of the most detailed animal assault
scenes shot in movie history ( If we leave out the homo sapiens
species).Where the movie falters a little is in fully exploring characterisation
. This becomes obvious because the director himself tries to add depth
to the characters but then somehow fails follow through and ends up
giving fairly transparent black and white characters. This stands in
stark contrast to the general plot which is rich with ethical grey
shades and a fairly complex situational setting.However , as an action movie the film is superb and unabashedly dishes
out hard hitting sequences of combat, gun fights, fist fights,
accidents and human suffering , so much so that one starts cringing
every time Leonardo comes on screen. Despite the excellent action , the movie was a little too indirect and
needlessly philosophical with an unclear chain of flashbacks haunting
Leonardo throughout the movie. What was the purpose of those flashbacks
apart from the obvious reliving memories , I seriously don't know. But
these pseudo-philosophical digressions derailed the movie partly and it
lost pace and precision. Westerns , to be thoroughly entertaining need
to have at least nominal theatricality . Otherwise what's the point of
watching a Western !!! Watch it once for sure , and then decide if you
would like watching it once more. I may, if it is telecast in the
future on TV , but not entirely . I will be skipping forward some
scenes .

"The Revenant" is without a doubt one film that thrills with drama and
action and it's filled with blood and it shows that human life can
often be pushed to the extremes. It also blends themes of faith,
survival and revenge to fine form. Actually the picture is based on the
true life story of Hugh Glass an 1820's fur trapper and his quest for
survival. And the cinematographer work is well done as the scenes of
nature and wilderness is stunning it seems so real as it almost takes a
little from the narrative as it seems the images move this long drawn
out adventure film.Anyway Leonardo DiCaprio(in his best performance yet)is Hugh Glass the
19th century hunter who stalks the American west on guard with his
rifle. The peace and beauty of the outdoors is shattered quickly in the
film as the Glass camp of fur traders are attacked in a blood and gore
carnage by Native Americans. This begins a saga a journey mission of
search and escape and this all involves Hugh and his son and thru time
flashback you find out about the demise of Hugh's wife. And in a fun
and compelling and seems like real yet very brutal and blood bath like
is the grizzly bear attack fight sequence that leaves Glass to almost
die. After this the adventure becomes more about a struggle to survive
and a journey that has twist and turns all it really turns into is a
revenge hunt that Glass must seek as payback can be hell.Overall "The Revenant" is a harsh and tough emotional film that proves
life is a struggle as one must fight for life all while dealing with
faith, and the spirit of believe as it's supported by loving nature and
loving family just as Glass did. And the performance from Leonardo
DiCaprio is his best ever he pushed himself to the limit for this role
nearly transforming his look and enduring the cold and snow type scenes
that he had to shoot in, yet all in all that helped make "The Revenant"
an emotional drama that shows tough images yet it dazzles.

I tend to see him more on People Magazine while working at my local
supermarket more so than I would like to but I have still always
enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio since the early 90's when he started his
career. He is an actor willing to put himself in the big spots and as
he has worked with famous directors like Martin Scorsese, Quentin
Tarantino or actors/actresses like Johnny Depp or Meryl Streep and Kate
Winslet, it shows he is doing something right. His latest film The
Revenant follows the same positives along with some similar themes of
his previous work.Based off real events and set in 1823, Hugh Glass (Dicaprio) gets
attacked by bear on a fur expedition. What follows is a survival story
dealing with the themes of revenge, climate issues and the stylings of
a western. A wilderness film trying to showcase life in the 1800's.DiCaprio is usually the dominant character in every movie that he is in
and The Revenant is no different as this is all about DiCaprio. Using
very little dialogue at times and coming from famed director Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu who uses these VERY impressive close ups and single
shots, DiCaprio seems to be always in your face here. From the times
his character is in pain to expressing emotions, DiCaprio is top notch
and he can do it all. A type of personality that DiCaprio has never
played before and being that's it's such an original storyline, it is
one he will likely won't play again.DiCaprio is the main piece but this cast has more. John Fritzgerald
(Tom Hardy) is Glass's enemy and a character that brings revenge into
the story. Hardy plays the role so well he's almost as good as
Dicaprio. Played by actor journeymen Domhnall Gleeson, Captain Andrew
Murray is a character who is the next closest leader to Glass. Even in
the smaller roles, there are recognizable names like Luckas Hass (so
underused though) and upcoming star Will Poulter.The Revenant is so different from what we see every Friday. The type of
style that I wish we saw more of. Something that just make us look
forward to more Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu films. A film that should
win Oscars once award season is here especially DiCaprio.

Interesting tale of survival and revenge.Set in America in the 1820s, a frontiersman, Hugh Glass (played by
Leonardo DiCaprio), is attacked and badly mauled by a bear. He is left
for dead by his comrades. Meanwhile a group of Indians are after him.
Thus starts his fight for survival and revenge...Loosely based on a true story, this is part drama movie, part action
movie. Written and directed by Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu, who usually
directs emotional human dramas which veer from interesting and profound
(Ammores Perros, Birdman, Babel) to dull and pretentious (21 Grams,
Biutiful), this is a bit of a departure for him. The dramatic touches -
dream sequences, symbolism - are still there but the action side is
new.And therein lies some of the problems with the movie. The drama,
catering for his existing followers, seems, at times, overwrought and
padded. Some of the dream sequences and flashbacks weren't entirely
necessary.Then we have the action, there to cater for the short attention spans
of Generations Y and Z. Some of it is good, and contributes to the
movie, but some of it feels very clumsy and just action for the sake of
it.This all said, the plot is interesting and engaging. Leonardo DiCaprio
gives a good performance in the lead role. Tom Hardy is solid as the
villain (though I would have preferred if he didn't try to make his
voice so unintelligible). Superb scenery and cinematography.It does drag towards the end though, as Inarritu adds sub-plots and
scenes that don't really add much. He slows the pacing down too. The
final scene is inevitable and largely predictable.Overall: a good movie, but not a great one.

Very much like a "There Will Be Blood" type movie including length and
pace. Mix that in with "Brokeback Mountain" visuals and "Into the Wild"
type visuals and score. The latter I liked best out of the 3 movies
though I disliked them all. A cinematic achievement on some level
granted, but you have to remember Birdman made the film. Unending
disconnect from reality for me...the fall into the tree, that did it
for me. By that point, I laughed out loud. I attended a screening where
DiCaprio spoke and he at one point said he didn't think anyone would
find anything wrong with the film which I thought, was he joking? I
vacillate between that statement being so or serious.

Great movie. After a movie in my opinion overrated (Birdman), director
Alejandro González Iñárritu last delivery in a decent prize work. The
Revenant is not 100% plan sequence as the trailer could fail to
understand, instead alternating between small parties in this style and
in normal courts or with spotlights on the stage, which makes the
experience of watching it much more dynamic, satisfying and without
saturation. Long Photographic is excellent, with amazing scenery, and
all featuring the characters be very good. Leonardo DiCaprio, even
without a lot of lines, is once again amazing in the role of
protagonist, giving all the emotional charge needed for a character so
full of feeling, the largest being the rage. Moreover, it is not only
DiCaprio worth mentioning, Tom Hardy is very good in his role as
antagonist, and Will Poulter surprises in its performance, even with a
character who is not very well worked during his screen time, he can
add ( and) charisma and other elements on a solid, lucid performance.
The whole concept of the story is engaging, not needing much time to
the viewer Imerse completely in the narrative, but the way how it is
developed further help in this regard. But nothing is perfect, on the
one hand the construction of some characters is very good, the other is
bad, Hawk (son of DiCaprio) is a character who just seems to be there
to cause trouble in no time becomes very clear if there a motif defined
for it, or if it is simply stupid. The film's soundtrack also does not
please me, leaving much to be desired, and in some part to annoying. In
short: The Revenant is a great film certainly has its faults, but still
is a great movie with great performances, outstanding photo and an
engaging story, very worth watching.

When i left this movie I had trouble putting my finger on exactly what
I thought about it, but the one conclusive statement was 'Meh';
although annoyingly i couldn't really capture why. It has most of the
ingredients I usually dig in a movie. The acting is good. The
characters have depth. The story is good. The intro scene with the pelt
hunting was awesome directing. The main character is a total bad-ass!
Everyone is believable, although it took a little while to get used to
Tom Hardy's characters voice, which at first it was hard to understand.
It overwhelmingly felt like a Terrance Malik movie (which for the most
part I dig). It was brooding and nature was as much of a main character
in the film as the actors were portraying. I guess my main gripe was
that it was too long. Not the movie as such, but most of the scenes or
shots. They just felt like they took too long. Lingering shots of sky,
or trees or water, or actors but just a few seconds too long than I
think they needed to be to make me feel differently. When done
consistently throughout a 2.5 hour film, i think it threw off the
pacing in a weird way. It's worth watching definitely. It's pretty and
dirty at the same time. You feel the cold and dis-comfort the
characters are feeling. DiCaprio is good. Hardy is great.

The Revenant - Hot on the heels of the success of his Oscar winning Birdman, Alejandro
González Iñárritu turns his hand to the Western with a tale of double
cross and revenge. DiCaprio plays fur trapper Glass, who is gravely
wounded during an attack by a bear (in a fantastic and utterly
convincing sequence) and ultimately abandoned and left for dead by some
of his companions. How his lust for vengeance keeps him alive is the
crux of the rest of the story. First of all the film looks fantastic,
with a real Kubrick/Barry Lyndon feel to some of the visuals. From the
snow on distant mountains to the mist winding through the forest its a
fantastic looking piece. The score, by Japanese legend Ryuichi Sakamoto
with Alva Noto and Bryce Dessner is also great, sparse and haunting. It
mirrors the landscape perfectly. The acting by leads Leo DiCaprio, an
almost unrecognisable Tom Hardy and Will Poulter is universally great,
with DiCaprio in particular giving a completely committed performance
as the wronged frontiersman Hugh Glass. If I had to criticise I would
say that not everything works, some of the dream/fantasy sequences seem
a bit naive and contrived, and it could also have benefited from being
maybe 20 minutes shorter. But although the story is pretty slight and
one-note I didn't find myself checking the time at all. I actually
preferred it to Birdman. Overall its now my second favourite weird and
violent snow draped western, losing the top slot to the vastly
underrated Ravenous 7/10

Despite the fact, that the ambiance and the amazing landscapes are once
more breathtaking, I couldn't get the same feeling of warmth, as
DiCaprio showed. Whether it was the stony and innutritive background of
humping and drinking bearded men which don't bear any humanity for the
sake of money, or the ever for blood pacing Indians. For me, there has
been too much space in between these plot lines, "The Revenant" didn't
came close to share any ideas or personality from any of its actors,
perhaps just DiCaprio. Don't expect something like "Dances with Wolves"
where this has been done brilliantly. It's a mere survival story, with
bland interruptions of monotonous doing but reasonable actors, and
breath taking nature shots. Well, for those who argue this could be the
next Oscar, indeed, it is the next step in career for DiCaprio, who
managed to perform through this whole movie without his money making
lady-killer smile. OK, lets get a hot cup of chocolate with magic
marshmallows, and review the scenery once more. maybe I will find some
chunk of gold I did miss before. 6/10

The visuals in this film are stunning, and it absolutely draws you into
the atmosphere. I can't imagine what all involved went through to
capture some of these scenes. It deserves to be seen on the big screen,
and, perhaps, is the only way it will really be appreciated since the
cinematography is really the star here. What action there is is
spectacular, but the film moves along at an extremely slow pace. In one
scene where characters were sleeping, I heard snoring, which seemed
rather appropriate. However, when I continued to hear the same snoring
during other scenes, I realized one of the patrons near me had fallen
asleep (and slept through most of the film). A man sitting next to me
also spent a large amount of viewing time with his chin on his chest. I
personally fought off sleep a time or two as well, but never succumbed.In short, the filmmaking itself is a spectacle to behold, and the
special effects are fantastic, but this isn't an action epic, so I'd
suggest not going to the theater tired. Oh, and I'd also suggest eating
BEFORE you see this, because you might not have much appetite
afterward. Reasons will become evident if you see the film.

The scenery was gorgeous. It is amazing that the director, Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu, went through the trouble of filming at locations
that must have been extremely difficult for the actors and crew.
However, by doing this, he kept the authenticity of the story. I
appreciate an effort such as this, as opposed to CGI. All of the actors
were strong and convincing. And, I can forgive the lack of continuity
in a few scenes. My issue with The Revenant was time. This movie is too
long. It drags at many places, making it boring. It could have been
trimmed by thirty to forty-five minutes without losing any of the
story. That would have made it a much more "edge of your seat" exciting
film.

**This review contains spoilers***I went into this film without any knowledge of the subject, Hugh Glass,
whatsoever.The film is amazing in many parts, the bear attack being one of them.
The scenery is absolutely beautiful and I appreciate the director not
compromising on this with CGI. Leonardo is absolutely riveting in this
film and I'd like to say his performance is definitely worth the Oscar,
without doubt.That said - what an absolute disgrace.The disrespect and harm of animals for this film was completely
unnecessary. A vegetarian eating raw bison liver? That's no vegetarian.It's a movie. Try as anyone may, this movie is nothing more than that.
It is a dramatized and fictionalized account of Hugh Glass' life, where
the director and crew have taken liberties well beyond the scope
required for any film. There was absolutely no need to;- eat raw Bison liver - sleep inside dead animal carcasses - have the
animals killed so the carcasses and liver were available in the first
place - rip apart a live fish for the camerasOpposite to what Leonardo has stated about eating the Bison liver - NO
ONE FORCED HIM TO DO THAT. He did it of his own volition and free will.In this day and age there is absolutely no reason for any one to be
harming or killing animals in order to make a film. It's disgusting and
completely tainted the whole experience for me.Needless killing of non-human beings for something as frivolous as a
movie, is some of the most debasing acts a human can participate in.This story had already been told, in print. This movie was a retelling,
and fabrication of some events. In it's telling for screen it has lost
some of its awe and incredulity due to the directors and crews blatant
unnecessary barbarianism of animals and the facts.Sure, I hope Leonardo wins the Oscar - because let's face it, Johnny
Depp is a joke - however I have to ask; Is it really worth sacrificing your core beliefs, in order to win a
statue? Vegetarians eating raw Bison liver in order to win a statue?
Letting directors push you to those places for their own desire for
notoriety and further fame?I'd make a terrible actor. Besides not being able to act, I'd never
harm another being for a 'movie' or anything else. I'd not sell myself
for some other base-level-humans' idea of 'art'. Nor would I place the
responsibility of my own actions at the feet of someone else. I'm really blown away by the stupidity and needless harm perpetrated in
this film. Humans like those in the directors position, positions of
power and purported respectability in the public landscape, have a
responsibility to act responsibly in their chosen vocation. Like many
directors before him (i.e. Peter Jackson the hobbit trilogy), Alejandro
has shown himself to be nothing more than a film zealot who will stop
at nothing for the completion of his own unimportant, irrelevant,
unoriginal, barbaric and sensationalized making of film.If you do go and see this film, please be aware the animals on screen
are dead (besides the bear), have been needlessly killed for this film.
Beautiful, amazing, majestic beings, culled for nothing more than one
males grotesque desires for shock and further fame and notoriety.The use of CGI here would have been the right thing to do Alejandro. I
personally hope you never get to make another film in your lifetime,It's such a shame this experience has been marred for me by this
violence towards those who have hurt none in their lives.I'll never spend a cent on any films related to Alejandro or Leonardo
in future. What you've done is unconscionable. It's a real shame,
because I enjoy watching Leonardo in films, he is such a major talent.Peace.

There is a lot of talk about how this movie is nominated for awards
etc..and while I like Lenoardo in movies, frankly this might be one of
his worst. The movie was not very good, in a lot of ways rather boring.
The bear scene gets all this rave but frankly, it really wasn't all
that. The bear even looked kind of cgi. the story itself was a bit much
to swallow. The guy might as well have been in the crucible with the
beating he took. Then he makes this magical comeback in a matter of a
few days. Tom hardy's character must have been too busy preparing for
legend or something because his role simply was not very well done.
Furthermore he always sounded like he had marbles in his mouth. with
all the hype people tried to give this movie I was expecting much much
much better. Maybe with less expectation it would have been more
enjoyable. But given all the hype it was a huge let down. I would not
pay to see this film, i do not recommend it to people i know. If you
want to see tom hardy in a better movie go see Legend. This is not the
next inception block buster movie.

This is a film that is more about the experience over the plot. So if
you are looking for a film with a plot that really sticks out you might
be disappointed. What this is, is a survival/revenge film with the core
being driven by revenge but most of the screen-time is a man trying to
survive in a cold wilderness. When it comes to the cinematography
though, there is a lot of effort and risk that went with it. There is
quite a bit of one long takes that is just mesmerizing sometimes to sit
through. It's like watching art on screen unfold. The scenery when it
comes to the wilderness, sparkling lake, the encompassing trees full of
color, and even the quietness of certain scenes can really draw in the
viewers. The lake, frozen over, disguised itself as a white valley, as
if I would be able to walk on water. It was one of the best camera-
work I have seen when capturing the frozen woods and mountainous areas.
The hallucinations and dream like sequences adds to the artistic aspect
of this film. It's like watching a captivating and engaging mainstream
high budget artistic film on screen. At least when it comes to the
cinematography although it lacks in the story section of it all.
Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be doing everything he can to win that
Oscar. And this movie is like the perfect set up for that. He gets the
chance to show off just about every acting chops in his arsenal. Tom
Hardy did a fine job of bringing about his character's accent while
also playing a cold and yet believable character. His dialogue at least
makes him understandable to a certain degree. Overall, this is not a
plot driven film but it's more for the experience. I personally haven't
seen anything like this before. It's not a film I would immediately go
out of my way to watch again. But it's a highly worth at least one
watch.7.9/10

I cannot fathom how this awful movie won awards! Leonardo DiCaprio did
his worst acting ever; the directing was horrid; and the scenery was
dark and undefined throughout. Many parts were slow and drawn out to
show ugly gray or white scenery or for reasons I could not ascertain.
Tom Hardy said that God was a squirrel. The camera remained on him for
about 30 seconds, as if he'd said something profound. A very obvious
mistake the director made throughout was overlooking Leonardo's well
manicured nails. He is in the wild for days/weeks. His beard grows,
hair grows, lips get all nasty looking, yet those nails remain
perfectly manicured. Okay, now imagine you are freezing and left to die
in a grave with a little dirt thrown on you. What would you do first?
Yes! You would try to find your son, but then you would build a fire!
Instead, they show Leonardo throwing on his furs and marching off into
the woods. All Leonardo did in the movie was grunt,groan, and make the
same faces over and over. He had very few lines to say. However, when
he should have absolutely screamed his lungs out, he made not even a
grimace. That was when he was getting into the freezing water to keep
from being seen by the Indians. With open cuts and freezing water, he
should have had a huge facial and physical reaction, even if he didn't
want them to hear him scream in pain. From there, this director has him
seen floating along in the icy river longer than a human can survive
without drowning from hypothermia. When Leonardo finally gets out of
the water, he is not even shivering. My husband caught a part where
Leonardo shot twice without reloading. I mean, was this director
smoking crack the whole time this was being filmed?! And he and
Leonardo got awards! It floors me. This movie didn't even make enough
money to cover its budget! All this money and time spent on a movie and
it is pitiful. A great movie about a sniper can't get an award, but
they award this trash?! The actor Tom Hardy is the one who did the best
acting. HE should have gotten the best actor award! Some of the other
actors were good also. I will never go to another movie directed by
this incompetent director. Elitests in Hollywood gave him an award, the
film an award, and Leonardo an award. I'm the movie goer. Therefore, my
decision is what counts. Only Tom Hardy would have received an award
from me. If I could, I would take all 3 awards and give them to the
sniper movie by Clint Eastwood, which was shamelessly blackballed by
those same Hollywood elitists.

If you live in the city or spend almost all your time in an office/
your home, this movie might blow you away. The cinematography is
absolutely amazing. However, if you regularly spend time outside or go
on vacation a lot, I reckon nothing beats reality and this movie will
show you little new.The problem with this movie is its story, which is non existent. While
you may argue that about half an hour of the movie is action packed and
fun to watch, the overall quality of the plot is just not there. The
plot is predictable and to me there was too little time to identify
with the characters and feel for them. On a side note: Leo did a great
job (as did Tom Hardy) but this is not the type of movie that allows
you to win an Oscar for acting.In conclusion: match your expectations if you want to go see this
movie. You will see great cinematography but you wont see anything
else.

The blueprint here is simple. A world that lies in wait and summons
unexpected violence that wrecks lives - it can be an Indian ambush, a
bear, or a greedy little man who will do anything for quick profit. A
world of immense beauty, inscrutable in workings, that we try to subdue
to our satisfaction.DiCaprio as our ability to coexist and adapt to the land, the
Fitzgerald character as that nature in man that only wants to please
itself and to grab. It's not just a meaningless violence that visits
them. We're made to note Indians out in search for a daughter that was
stolen, a bear that was only protecting its young. Meaning, there's
agency behind the random cruelty.Other filmmakers, Malick for one, would be content to evoke different
ways of framing the question posed by this world so that we would end
up hopefully with a whole cloud of floating realities. (Malick no doubt
knows that agency as what the Chinese call the Tao). Inarritu is plot-
and action-driven and reflects in the gaps instead.I mean this is a film where two hours in we still have shenanigans like
DiCaprio crashing down from a cliff. It has a clear causality. One
event precipitates the next. So when the Indians spare a pointless
death in the end, it registers as plot contrivance instead of spiritual
realization that severs the cycle of suffering. We ask, why would they
spare him? Which is the wrong question.This is just not a very astute work and it comes down to perhaps one
thing; how the camera breathes life into the world. It is Malick
inspired, most obvious in the dream scenes. But it rests on a poor
understanding of him. Malick frees eye from world, the eye that recalls
and reflects from the world of events with its clear causality, so that
the eye can float in and out of lives, entering events, memories,
urges, anticipations in a seamless flow that encompasses a bigger
whole. Inarritu has no notion of this yet. Birdman showed that he might be
coming around but no dice. This one frames events as action or dream;
its idea of visual poetry is to embed characters in beautiful vistas
and have that surround from the outside. It enters this one guy and we
have revenge and regret. Oh there are a few continuous shots, an
impressive one early; but it's just elaborately choreographed action.
The shot ends with the Indian chief whispering a plot point to the
camera about his stolen daughter.No harm in seeing this one. But it would be even better if it propels
you to study Malick beneath the soliloquy as a master of the floating
eye. Further back it was Jancso and Tarkovsky. It's on discoveries of
people like these - people who'd be deemed too abstract and would have
gone jobless in Hollywood - that this one rests. You'll know this if you track down a previous retelling of the same
story in the Richard Harris film. The most notable difference between
the two is that one uses the naturalistic camera of the western, this a
more abstract one. But as commonplace in its use as the other was then.

Harrowing, gripping, brutal, bold, harsh and a visceral depiction of
one man's willpower. Murphy's Law kept slipping from one crap to the
next, to the next and the protagonist survived somehow every time, I'm
not sure about if one should call that luck or the exact opposite? The
Revenant is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the
works of writer/director Terrence Malick. Inarritu's masterpiece, a
tour de force, if I've ever seen one. From the amazing opening shot,
this movie immediately hooks you. The movie is a brutal depiction of
man against the wild. a survivalist story that can sometimes be
difficult to watch, as some of the scenes can be quite gruesome. the
performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are spectacular.
Effectively it transports us to another time and place, while always
maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art. You don't just watch
"The Revenant," you experience it. The camera movements, the tracking
shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done and shown
in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with an over 10
minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly captivating and
awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to their limits both
physically and creatively. PS- It provides an immensely absorbing experience to those who have an
affinity for the wilderness. It'll be highly ludicrous of Academy if
Leo doesn't get his first Oscar for this.

This movie is very realistic but the script don't really justify the
play time of 2.5 hours. There is so little dialog in the movie that you
don't really connect to the characters and therefore you don't care
much what happens to them. Leonardo is unconscious about half the movie
and washing him struggle for one hour+ is boring. The script is not
very original and very straightforward, you always know what is going
to happen and there are none or few surprises. The acting is superb but
the script really failed to capture me. All and all I would say this
movie is the total opposite of the dialog based movie the hateful eight
even though the scenery is mush the same.

With the Revenant you will join a group of world class actors and the
rising stars on a cold, wet and bloody journey through natural lighted
mountains, forest and swamps.(small 1st plot point spoilers possible)It's a simple story of a 'Dances of the Wolves' like man who lived
among the "savages" and is showing the arrogant whites a save passage
through enemy territory. It's a story of a man who's lost everything
but his son, which he had with a beautiful Indian woman. A clearly
ambitious Patrokles-like son, who is forced to keep his mouth shut in
order to survive the hate of the whites. When the man loses his son,
the problems begins - plot-wise. Since he's lost his only emotional
connection, we don't get very much to know his character in later
scenes anymore. And a death of a loved one might shock us for a moment,
but as the character and as with every film and it's duration, we carry
on. What can you offer me next?Unfortunately even the beautifully conceived wide angle mood shots
can't pick up the slack. All acquaintances are short. It clearly
overkills the dark, noirish conception of the character. Now I have no
clue about the original source of material but a reinterpretation of it
would have been good - something like a companion, or even an animal.
Think of Dances with the Wolves and how the death of the wolve grabbed
our emotional attention, after we've learned how the friendship was
build. Another appropriate example might be Nicholas Wending Refn's
Valhalla Rising. There again we have a buddy-movie like plot device -
the boy, with whom the nameless fighter can connect and defend, which
makes him at least more of a three dimensional, human killing machine.
The revenant is plot driven, which is such a missed opportunity,
because we actually are interested and care for the main character, but
are left unsatisfied, and I mean not in a cliffhanger way of
unsatisfied. Mr. Iñárritu co-wrote the script with Mark L. Smith. Now I'm sure that
there is a clear set of symbolism which might illustrate certain inner
thoughts etc., but this should'nt have been conceived as an art housian
film. It should have been written with clear cinematic language, with
iconic symbols, with more emotion, rather than too much of the ultra
realistic gore. Yes, animals died for this movie and it's absolutely
justified in order to depict the survival in nature. Take it or leave
it, but your chicken did not die of stroking. I picture a lot of fun
and work in the production design process, but as so often today, the
script wasn't ready yet and no one cared, because great actors signed
in already. The script heavily relied on Hemingway's iceberg principle.
Show the tip of the iceberg, the rest is imagination. Well, in this
case the polished mood pictures just weren't sufficient for me. Seeing
all the twitter reviews about the bad pacing only proofs my point. As
film lovers we all know that film is never about the real-time, it's
about emotional-time. Scarface is a near 3 hour epic but for us it
feels like a short drug intoxication. Why? Because we don't feel the
grass growing, but rather a light-speed trip to mars. To close with a Oscar prediction: Sorry Leo, it ain't work this time.
You gave a marvellous performance. You swallowed so much dirt, only
Christian Bale can beat you with that. But your character lacked the
emotional dept an audience needs that in order to be behind you. No
Sir, it was not your preparation, not your dramatic art. Through the
setting you were forced to suffer, but any actor in this role would
have, so what was there to stand out? Unfortunately the soucre material
did not allow you to go in for more.

This director reminds me of Stanley Kubrick. Everybody was afraid to negatively review his movies.So, Kubrick's self indulgent film making got a free ride from the
critics. And the parallel is with the director of the Revenant.Almost unwatchable at times.I was (and so were my companions) looking at our watches.If I saw any more wide nature vista scenes(which had absolutely no
connection with the story) I was going to kill myself with my stale
popcorn.2 1/2 hours I'll never get back.

While exploring the uncharted wilderness in the 1800s, Hugh Glass
sustains injuries from a brutal bear attack. When his hunting team kills his son and leave him for dead, Glass must
utilise his survival skills to find a way back home. Grief-stricken and fuelled by vengeance, Glass treks through the wintry
terrain to track down John Fitzgerald, the former confidant who
betrayed and abandoned him........Like some bizarre hybrid of Quest For Fire, Come And See, First Blood,
and Gladiator, The Revenant may be durationaly draining, but thanks to
some truly breathtaking camera-work and long shots, it's easily one of
the most tense and exciting movies of the year.To say the film is grim is an understatement, you an almost feel the
elements that the characters have to contend with through their quests,
and although the film is brutally realistic and harsh at times, it has
an almost magical, mystical element to it, as if we are seeing the film
through Glasses weary, anguished, angry, near death eyes.Iñárritu proves once again that he is an amazing film maker, with an
amazing attention to detail, and even though Birdman wasn't as
brilliant as it thought it was, it's gimmick of appearing to have only
one take, was a pretty phenomenal feat.Light on dialogue, but heavy on the visceral, there are two key scenes
that make Glasses journey all the more determined. The bear attack,
isn't only a brutal five minutes, only usurped by Bone Tomahawks death
scene for most brutal scenes of the year, it's almost flawless with its
use of effects, and the fact that it looks like its a one shot take,
just adds to the awe.Secondly, Glass laying helpless, knowing that he will eventually blink,
and then seeing Fitzgerald commit the most abhorrent act, Dicaprios
acting here is flawless, and if he does win an award for this role, it
will be for this scene alone. Never before have I seen anger, despair,
guilt, hatred, and helplessness, perfectly acted without the actor
uttering one syllable.Hardy too is excellent, but it wished he would have left his Bane
Accent at home, it rally did take me away from key scenes.It's an unflinching movie, long shots really putting you in the middle
of the film, and if this doesn't win every award going for
cinematography, there is something wrong with the world.An achievement, and then some.

The Revenant is visual beauty to hold with great shots; other than that
the story is simplistic lacking suspense or tension in the great
backdrop.There are a few good scenes but at the end it leaves the viewer nothing
much to care about. Leonardo does give a terrific performance, but this is not one that
cries Oscar as he should have won it before.There is little dialogue and a lot can be interpreted through the
actors expression. It's a one off movie that does not have repeated viewing capability.
Nothing much to reflect upon.6/10

Joner, Joshua Burge, Duane Howard, Melaw Nakehk'o, Fabrice Adde, Arthur
RedCloud, Christopher Rosamond, Robert Moloney, Lukas Haas, Grace Dove.
Filmmaker Alejanrro Gonzalez Inarritu - who co-penned the screenplay
with Mark L. Smith based on Michael Punke's novel - continues to prove
his mettle as a director to be reckoned with in a truly epic taking of
a formidable recognizable western - the vengeance drama. With echoes of
THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES, DiCaprio gives blood (literally and should
finally score that elusive Academy Award for a tremendous performance)
as frontiersman/tracker Hugh Glass whose expedition with a troupe of
fur trappers leads into a harrowing survivalist quest at vengeance and
redemption when he is brutally attacked by a bear (one of the film's
most unsettling moments) only to witness venal Hardy (worthy of an
Oscar himself) murder his Native American son (Goodluck) and left for
dead himself. With a will to pursue his traitor with enough vigor and
forthright to move a mountain, Glass' ascent to revenge is to be slaked
by the film's audience as well. Shot with painterly skill by Emmanuel
Lubezki, a grand score by extraordinary trifecta Bryce Dessner, Carsten
Nicolai and Ryuichi Sakamoto, and vistas to be only dreamed of by
production designer Jack Fisk who makes smart skills of using the
wintry, pristine outbreak of foreign land feel alien and all too
ethereally beautiful and equally haunting. One of the best films of the
year and demands to be seen on a ginormous screen!

Leo crawling through snow. Leo crawling through water. Leo crawling
through mud. Leo crawling through angst. Endlessly. How much of this
can one viewer take? Yes its gritty. Yes its gory. Yes its violent. And
yes, it is 100% predictable, which means it is not very entertaining.
Not for me anyway. The characters are manipulated, the bear is
obviously digital and the dialogue is pure 21st century style. Some
good performances by DiCaprio and Hardy, but so one note. I thought
Gleeson was a poor choice for his role as he seems to lack the power of
leadership. "Inspired by True Events" is the lamest way to try to buy
credibility. Do yourself a favour and watch Man in the Wilderness or
Jeremiah Johnson instead.

Its worse then a Michael Bay film. It made me want to rip my eyes out
of their sockets and vomit all over the floor. The bear scene was
disgusting. Bestiality should never be shown to the naked eye. I will
be scarred for all of eternity. I would rather watch "The Act Of Seeing
With One's own eyes" then watching a movie like "The Revenant." At
least necrophilia only involves dead bodies and no animals. Anyways,
back to the movie review. There are three words that describe the
Revenant the best. "It is death." Yeah, it's that bad. This movie is on
a whole new level of diarrhea. The movie is basically flooded with it.
Just wanted to get my opinion out on the Revenant since it is arguably
the worst movie of all time.-By: Anal Bud

Oh what can I say about The Revenant? It's a two and an half hour epic
with Leonardo DiCaprio doing his darndest to act like an injured man
abandoned and trying to survive in a world of harsh elements and
enemies, but unfortunately he's also up against a cast of others whose
acting, to put it bluntly, just plain sucks. I've never seen Tom Hardy
overact before, but here you have an example of it and it isn't pretty.
I guess when you're doing three or four blockbusters a year, one of
which requires you to play two different people, you have a hard time
putting your heart and soul into your character.DiCaprio is also up against a script that kept me scratching my head.
Everything in it seems borrowed and haphazardly pieced together: the
opening action sequence seems borrowed from Saving Private Ryan (only
with arrows and hooting "Indians" instead of guns and Nazis); the mood
seems borrowed from Into the Grey; the main character borrowed from
Dances With Wolves (although stripped of all humanity and charm).
Nothing seems new here. Furthermore, none of the characters are
developed, likable or relatable. They are all fowl mouthed, brutal,
murderous savages, including DiCaprio's character, whose only
connection to humanity is his love for his son; and in regards to that,
only God knows why, since the kid is so miserable, bitter and brooding
himself.The Revenant is visually stunning (I'll hand it that), and if you can
suspend your disbelief, you are in for a real treat. Personally,
however, I couldn't get into the grand finale, when DiCaprio is
sprinting, as nimble as a doe, through the ice and snow, when just a
few weeks before in this movie time a great big bear mauled him so
savagely that he barely clung to his life, tearing his flesh to shreds
and breaking several of his bones--not to mention every thing that
happens to him AFTER that--yet he's somehow back to full strength for
the obligatory revenge scene. When exactly did his broken leg heal
without being set or put into a cast, for example: when he was tumbling
helplessly down a waterfall or when he was single-handedly taking on an
entire French brigade?No. Sorry, Alejandro González Iñárritu. You can throw all the finesse
in the world into your movie pal, but if it doesn't ring true, I won't
be emotionally engaged.So there you have it: my take on The Revenant.

Loosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman Hugh Glass, The
Revenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of Leonardo
DiCaprio's best performances yet. The film follows Glass after he is
mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders. One of
the frontiersmen, John Fitzgerald, kills his son, and Glass voyages
over 200 miles to exact revenge on him. The Revenant is one of the most
violent movies I've seen from 2015, although the incredible scenery and
cinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look
at. It combines some intense, difficult-to-watch scenes with amazing
scenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films I've
seen. Leo's committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the
best of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the
film. The 156- minute running time, relentless brutality and limited
dialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish, but The Revenant is a
masterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matter's
intriguing story.

Wow. What a classic. What an absolute legend of a motion picture. I
don't often give out 10/10s, but when I do it tends to be for the sort
of brutal, cynical edge-of-your-seat madness that The Revenant thrives
on. I really liked Birdman, but Innaritu has done some of his best work
here. From the cinematography to the performances to the technical
finesse to totally maddening brutality, this is a masterpiece of epic
proportions. With regards to immersion, there are sort of two types of
films. Some, like the works of Goddard, seem to want to have us think
intellectually about the movie, to interact with the movie as a person
external to the film interacting with that film. I like these movies,
but The Revenant comes from an entirely different world. This is the
sort of movie that you get drawn into, where you forget that you are
inside a movie theater watching a movie and instead feel the movie at a
raw, terrifying, fundamental level. If the frenetic delivery of Birdman
was tantamount to jazz, the bare bones brutality of The Revenant is
more like industrial metal. I've seen it twice, and intend to go again,
and I'd recommend that anyone with eyes and a strong stomach to do the
same.

The Revenant is /amazing/.It's genuinely not my kind of thing (I literally went because General
Hux (Gleeson) is in it), but oh gosh, it took my breath away. The
cinematography is some of the best I have /ever/ seen in a movie; it's
so aesthetically pleasing as well. I've never cried over a bit of
bloody snow before, oh wow.Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson have such amazing
acting skills in this movie; I freaking fell in love with Domhnall's
character, again, my life is over. If Leo doesn't get his Oscar for
this movie, then the Committee are just biased against him not getting
one. Tom Hardy's character is a total freaking dick, #FuckFitzgerald,
but I love that I hated one of Hardy's characters  it shows just how
an amazing actor he is, to make a fan detest his character. Domhnall
Gleeson's character is just a sweetheart, you really just want the best
for him and you just wanna wrap him up in bubble wrap and a blanket.There are a few trigger warnings  gore obviously, there's a small r*pe
scene which lasts, I'd say about 15-25 seconds, and yea, there's a lot
of animals that 'die'. There's gore throughout the film, there's not
really much you can do to avoid it (you'd be ignoring about 60-70% of
the movie). (Note  this was not tagged as spoilers as it gives nothing
in the plot away. It's just a warning for people that may be effected
by these things.)Honestly, I wish I could permanently implant it into my hippocampus, I
am so taken aback. I feel so raw yet so... I don't know how to explain
it, like emotionally strong at the same time? (That may be my autism.)
I genuinely cannot wait to go see it again with my friends, and I
cannot wait to buy this on DVD release.There is nothing in this movie to stop me giving it a full 10/10, I am
honestly in love.

This is an amazing movie about human emotions and their results on our
body. If you are interested to see someone who lives by using his body,
mind and heart it's a master piece. Even though the word in the title
"The revenant " has nothing to do with the word "revenge" it is about
taking revenge. Through the film I was full of emotions of taking
revenge but the film ended in such a perfect way that my all mindset is
changed. As I was grown up with Turkish culture in which people even
kill each others for generations long to take their revenge, this film
changed my way of thinking. It's a long film but woth every second of
it.

- RATING: 10/10 - The Revenant is about a group of hunters that have to
run away after they were attack by the natives. One of the best hunters
Hugh Glass is mauled by a bear, and the hunters captain commands
Fitzgerald and Bridger to watch him. Fitzgerald leaves him behind
because to end his suffering. Glass' son Hawk tries to convince
Fitzgerald not to leave him behind but ends up getting killed. Glass is
buried alive but comes back to get revenge on Fitzgerald. - This movie
is brutal, and intense. I thought this movie had a really good plot,
and it had really good acting from Lenardo Di Caprio and Tom Hard. The
action scenes are brutal, bloody, and intense. And I gotta say that
bear scene was so intense and you felt his suffering. Let's not forget
the cinematography, my god it's beautiful. They don't use any
spotlights, they use fire and the sun for its lighting which is pretty
impressive. I liked that because it makes it feel like you're actually
in the forest instead of a Hollywood movie set. Some people may say
this movie is slow but I like it slow because it focuses more on glass'
suffering and focused more on survival. - OVERALL: The Revenant is a
really good survival movie. I recommend watching it if you can handle
slow paced movies. I give the Revenant a 10/10 a masterpiece I would
buy I blu Ray.

The Revenant hearkens back to many other classic "ImdB top 250" movies
while maintaining an element of Innaritu's originality, as well as a
narrative complexity which prevents it from straying entirely into
tired cliché in most moments. Amazing visuals and performances coupled
with intense action will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout
it's entire 2 and a half hour run time.For example, the opening battle sequence cliché hasn't been done this
well or with such furor outside of may be Saving Private Ryan. The
wonderful intermittent landscape shots (ruthless mother nature playing
the role of antagonist just as vehemently as Tom Hardy's character, and
is thusly afforded plenty of screen time) reminded me at times of
similar shots in Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring,
especially when the group of fur traders are trekking across
snow-covered mountain tops. Innaritu even seemed to take inspiration
from "The Empire Strikes Back" as the main character seeks refuge from
a snowstorm by cutting open the carcass of a dead animal. Overall the
movie reminded me the most of Gladiator throughout, a man seeking
revenge on those who murdered his family and left him for dead. It's
not a massive spoiler to say the movie even ends with a similar shot as
Ridley Scott's movie, of the main character looking at a dream image of
his deceased love.Even though if you were harsh you might say Innarritu is recycling
classic tropes, I think the Revenant matches up in terms of quality to
most of the movies I have just mentioned, and Innaritu does manage to
add his own original touch. Even though there aren't any
4th-wall-breaking elements as in Birdman, the spiritual elements in the
dream/fantasy sequences gel nicely with the film's undertone of
portraying nature as a godly and at times even supernatural force. A
force that the Natives as well as Hugh Glass have learned to cope with.
Glass's affinity towards nature and by extension the Natives is also
represented by his relationship with his Pawnee son by a deceased
Pawnee woman. This is juxtaposed with a scene where a French fur trader
literally rapes a Native woman whom Glass ends up rescuing. Even though
these two points quite obviously present an anti-colonialist narrative
we have all seen before, the Native American subplot was presented with
enough moral ambiguity throughout to keep me interested. The natives
themselves were capable of immense cruelty at times, but at the end the
only true villains were Tom Hardy's Fitzgerald...and the Bear.If I have to justify docking a point it's because the movie did stretch
my disbelief a bit on how many improbable events Hugh Glass actually
managed to survive in a row, despite it being "based on" a true story
and all that. I don't want to enter into excessive spoiler territory
but the one situation that had me rolling my eyes a bit was when he
rode his horse off a cliff at the exact spot he needed to in order to
have a tree break his fall. All this in order to avoid being shot to
death by angry Natives. Literally he found the only way to survive that
situation through pure luck i.e. it will only happen in the movies. I
think Innaritu may be could've come up with a better way to kill off
the horse so that Leo could cut it open sleep in it Han Solo style?

What a movie! I give it 10 stars. I couldn't wait to go see it, so I
went the day it started showing at my local theater. It was one of the
best movies I've ever seen. The storyline was good, but that isn't what
made it such an amazing cinematic experience.The movie plot is loosely based on the life of a real life fur trapper
named Hugh Glass, around 1820. Hugh Glass is played by Leonardo
DiCaprio. He is seriously injured from being attacked by a large
grizzly bear, while game hunting alone. The men he's with hear his
cries for help , and take care of his wounds. John Fitzgerald, played
by Tom Hardy is really great, but his mumbling is hard to understand at
times. Hugh Glass is abandoned, because he becomes a burden to carry in the
frozen, remote wilderness, according to one of the men. Now it's a
fight for survival in the unforgiving freezing wilderness. He is driven
to survive to seek revenge for betrayal and the cold- blooded murder of
a loved one. The freezing cold isn't his only obstacle.It definitely isn't your run of the mill revenge and survival story.
Alejandro Inarritu's awesome directing and Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful
cinematography are what makes the movie so awesome for me. Lubezki's
cinematography of the beautiful freezing wilderness, and the dreamlike
imagery drew me into the movie. Only natural light is used, which
enhances the beautiful scenery even more. I was so drawn into the movie
that I often felt cold. So realistic.Now that has to be good movie
making if you have that kind of effect on your viewers.Leonardo DiCaprio does deserve the Oscar and likewise for Alejandro
Inarritu. Lubezki should receive an Oscar for his gorgeous
cinematography.I recommend you to go see this movie at a movie theater.
The bigger the screen the better. Also, there were some gory scenes,
but I've seen worse. A very intense, gripping beautiful movie.
Breathtaking in so many ways. If you're looking for a movie with a lot
of profanity and like movies you've seen before, then you might not
enjoy "The Revenant." Also, it's got some tear jerking scenes. Best
movie of 2015 in my opinion.

Leonardo Di Caprio as Hugh Glass (a frontiersman and the 19th century
Bear Grylls) brings us his career peak performance, one that will be
remembered for decades ahead as one of the most compelling and most
ravishing in movie history, shoulder to shoulder with legends like
Marlon Brando (Don Corleone) and Heath Ledger (The Joker).Directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and produced by Markus
Barmettler, "The Revenant" steals the show as one of the most wondrous
adventure drama movies in the last few years, along with Emmanuel
Lubezki's flawless cinematography (Birdman, Gravity) that can only be
compared to Steven Spielberg's work and his marvelous long takes. All
that is mingled with the masterpiece score by Carsten Nicolai and
Ryuichi Sakamoto, music geniuses that offer us a soundtrack that seals
in our memory and refuses go away for quite a while after watching "The
Revenant". This amazing score compensates for the lack of dialogue and
monologue in some of the scenes.Set in the 19th century, "The Revenant" unfolds the story of the
frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo Di Caprio),who is attacked by a
grizzly bear and then left for dead by his fellows, among whom are his
half-American half-Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), John Fitzgerald
(Tom Hardy) and 7 more men of his village, which had been previously
attacked and scavenged by the American natives. After witnessing the
murder of his son right before his eyes Hugh Glass has nothing to live
for except the journey he's embarking on, ergo he's forced to
experience the Man-vs-Wild story, which he's all by himself in, seeking
revenge for his stabbed-to-death son. We can see elements from Bear
Grylls and Killing Season during some of the scenes, especially the
horse one, which recalls memories of Bear Grylls in the desert trying
to fit in that dead camel. Amazing.It's not only the cinematography and the astonishing directing that
leave us dazzled, but also the breath-taking landscapes and the "small"
detail that the movie is not shot in a studio, and that moment and
every scene seems extremely genuine and real.Utterly gripping adventure survival story that holds us on the edge of
our seats with alluring performances by Di Caprio and Hardy, who
entirely and perfectly fit their characters' demeanors, to give us that
kind of astonishing performances worthy of being revered and loudly
applauded.

"The Revenant" is the latest film by Alejandro González Iñárritu and is
the followup to the much lauded super hero satire "Birdman", my
favorite film of 2015.It's a tale of wilderness survival, based on the true story of Hugo
Glass, a frontiersman and guide for hunters and trappers who gets left
for dead after a vicious bear attack and now travels the snowy terrains
of Louisiana looking to get back at the men who abandoned him.The film opens with a visceral Indian attack scene, featuring many long
takes that are stitched together to appear seamless. It worked better
in "Birdman", I think, because here the camera goes from horseback, to
going underwater, from extreme closeups of actors faces, to sweeping
vistas. It was beautiful to look at, but at times it looked a bit stagy
and went on a bit too long.It could be said that the whole movie was overlong. If they cut down
the middle section where Glass was wondering the wilderness, struggling
to survive, dreaming about his dead wife in-between, the movie would
have been better. That said, the first and third acts are spectacular,
with a great supporting cast including Tom Hardy as the gruff
Fitzgerald - whom is the object of Glass' revenge - and their level-
headed captain, Andrew Henry is excellent as well. He's played by
Domhnall Glesson, who is having a great year for movies, being in four
Oscar nominated films.You can only really appreciate "The Revenant" on a large screen, with
its sweeping vistas and landscapes, and those intense closeups of
Leonardo DiCaprio when you see his cold breath on the camera lens. His
performance is excellent, showing realistically what it would be like
to try and survive in harsh conditions - and his determination to get
back at Fitzgerald is shown plainly on his face, without the need for
any words to be said. The CGI is also implemented well, being wholly
convincing when mixed together with the real locations.It's a movie that I appreciate for the artistry more than enjoy as
entertainment. I was bored midway through, but the third act made up
for it. What the movie lacks in plot, pacing and characterization, it
makes up for in the visuals.The cinematography is truly spectacular, some of the best I've even
seen in a movie. Without using 3D, the movie manages to be completely
immersive; I felt chilly just watching it at the cinema I went to
(maybe because I was wearing shorts, but I'll give this one to he
credit of the filmmaker).Is "The Revenant" flawed? Yes, but it gives audiences a reason to go to
the cinema, and not just watch films on their TV or smart phone. I'm in
no hurry to see it again, but I'm glad that I did.

Okay, so Inarritu has amazing power but always used it to make
manipulative movies with a lot of sensation (Biutiful, 21 Grams,
Babel). Then he made a cynical movie about theater simply for Oscar
critics that was pretty good called Birdman, won the Oscar.With that win, he finally has financial backing and self-esteem because
this is his first great movie. Cinematography is beautiful and should
win an award (aided by great fx).It's solid, a fun trainwreck, pretty, has heart, interweaves beautiful
dream sequences coherently that help tell the story. The acting is top
notch.The biggest problem is the plot is generic. There's really one plot
point, and it's the oldest in the book. And anything else, yeah we
already know people love their family and sh-t. Great, but not best
picture good. Mad Max deserves it.

What is there to say about this film that hasn't already been said 100
times? It's shot beautifully with amazing landscapes and haunting
imagery. Some of the action sequences, particularly some of the early
moments of the film, are totally unforgettable and will leave you with
that open-mouthed "how did they do that" look on your face. Leonardo
DiCaprio and Tom Hardy completely disappear into their roles. I think
it's time to hand them both Oscars. The only thing that stops me from giving it a perfect 10 is the story.
In the end, it's more or less a pretty simple story of revenge and
survival, which is great and very well executed, but I guess I was just
hoping for a little more to it. Then again, I can't really come up with
anything, so maybe this will iron itself out with a couple more
viewings. I'd recommend this to just about any film fan, certainly
those that enjoy the work of DiCaprio and Hardy, who probably have
never been better.

With the Oscars just a month away, it's time to speculate on whether
this will be Leo's year. The film has accumulated the most Academy
Award Nominations this year with a very impressive 12, this is enough
to guarantee a satisfactory movie going experience for many.The film is beautifully shot and the action is both dramatic and
realistic, however it's the dramatic achievements of the leads that
grab the attention. Leonardo DiCaprio gives an emotional and convincing
performance as the protagonist on his journey of survival in an
unforgiving land. DiCaprio keeps you engrossed throughout the film
despite the lack of dialogue in many scenes, and portrays a man
consumed by pain, loss, anger and hope all at once. Leo is the current
favourite for this years Leading Actor Oscar and my pick as well.Another Oscar nominated performance this time for a supporting role is
achieved by Tom Hardy, playing opposite DiCaprio in some of the films
most tense scenes, he keeps up with DiCaprio throughout, proving he too
is deserving of an Oscar nod.The beginning of the film is fast paced with all our lead characters
involved, it does however slow down about halfway through and the
amount of dialogue decreases substantially, the movie is very artistic
and would not be to everyone's taste, there is no comedy to be had here
with moments of real despair, however you remain hopeful due to
DiCaprio's characters shear resilience in these difficult situations.A masterpiece in direction and cinematography with almost guaranteed
Oscar wins to come. Not for the faint of heart with realistic violence
and upsetting scenes, but a real survival story with excellent acting
and stunning visuals.

Just think of any actor who is willing to act with a bear ????? Are you
willing ????? I am not . one of the few outstanding performances seen
in the movie though the story is not so great but all is well that ends
well.The Revenant is a film that works on a plethora of levels. It
follows a fairly basic story line that the average moviegoer could
wholly understand. However, there is much more looming within the
incredibly imagery and filmmaking of the Revenant than one might
assume.The depth of the shots is overwhelming; the mountains and the snow in
the film are amazing to look at. Unfortunately, the plot and characters
don't live up to the look of "The Revenant." The film is vacuous and
lacks substance.Leonardo DiCaprio may win the Oscar for the best actor.

Alejandro González Iñárritu's career in Hollywood is going pretty well
nowadays: only at the 2015 Academy Awards he won three Oscars for
directing, producing and writing "Birdman", and as if that wasn't
enough, he's back one year later with another incredible piece of
cinema, longing to take home a few more statuettes and to make history
as the first director winning twice in a row the biggest award in
cinema. Watching his new work, "The Revenant", there's little to argue
about his deserving the price: every scene is studied in the most
impacting way possible, and sometimes you get to wonder how did he
manage to shoot a piece in a certain way that appears to break the laws
of physics. Sure thing, his camera work is supported by the
unparalleled cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who already worked for
Iñárritu in "Birdman" and for fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuaròn in
"Gravity"), whose use of light makes this movie not only an engaging
survival adventure, but one that can also be enjoyed for its views and
landscapes only. The story may be considered the weak part of the
project, as it isn't particularly inventive (at least until the last
few sequences) and maybe exceeds sometimes in giving some sort of
invincibility to the protagonist, but it works perfectly with the other
components and it's hard to imagine how else it should have been
unraveled once the film is finished. Speaking of the protagonist,
Leonardo DiCaprio may have found the role that will finally let him
enter the Oscars family: his turn is incredibly real, brutal and
painful, his voice is raspy and hardly recognizable and his physicality
has changed a lot for the role since "The Wolf of Wall Street". He
definitely deserves the gold, even only to make amends for the previous
snubs. At his side are two of the busiest actors of our time, Tom Hardy
as the baddie (or is he?), and Domhnall Gleeson as the captain of the
expedition. Both of them did a great job, but especially Hardy with his
hypnotizing, rough way of speaking and his complex personality which
makes him a very hard character to define. All considered, this movie
is well deserving of his Best Picture nod and the probable winner.May not be as stellar as "Birdman", but it's a very close second. 9/10

And you try and tell me that the film is boring and not interesting,
well the film was shot in best possible way and with a great actors.
Joy to watch , very very good I like it. 1. Leo is on top same are
Hardy, and the story. Bear attack, the weather, gold, hunting
everything was made very well. if you asks me Leo deserves an Oscar not
just for this movie but the previous his aviator he deserved the Oscar
some how he didn't get it. Pheonix deserved in 2013 for hes performance
in the master i really don't know why they give it to Lincoln guy he is
too a very good actor but 2013 was for me Joaquin best and Hofman for
supporting role those two characters made this movie very very
interesting to watch.

Following Birdman, although Alejandro G. Inarritu had been developing
this project long before that film, this film is a step back in joking
and light-heartedness and a step up in white-knuckle fury.I do love this movie, but given the movie does have some very minor
problems, I'll just quickly cover them all.1. The script, whilst it isn't god-awful and the crew do amazing things
with the film despite it, it is easily the weakest part of the film.
Unlike Birdman, where whatever got shot got ended up in the movie, this
movie is shot a bit more conventionally with edits and the like, so the
script just isn't as tight. 2. Tom Hardy's accent, even by his
standards, takes a lot of effort to understand. He's got the diction
and the enunciation of a heavy Texan down to a tee but he rushes it
sometimes and it is a little distracting. 3. Hugh Glass's dreams can
get very weird and often pretentious. Personally, I like a little bit
of pretentiousness, but you possibly won't. Just a friendly warning
than an outright flaw.Alright, now I've done this, time to gush about the film: The direction
is amazing - the angles we see are insane, and when the movie does
eventually mix with CGI for the animals, notably the bear attack, I'm
amazed with how real it actually looks. The Cinematography is f---ing
AMAZING! I remember making a film in Abbey Wood, and struggling to get
a good shot in decent weather, and so how they got a lot of these
beautifully framed shots I'll never know. Every new shot of the film, I
just kept asking "how did they do that?", and even the scenes of
unbelievable violence like the bear attack or the fights with the
Indians look so gorgeous. The acting of the four main players is great
- the four main players are Will Mellor playing the young Jim Bridger,
Domhall Gleeson as Captain Andrew Henry, Tom Hardy playing the
antagonistic John Fitzgerald and obviously Leonardo DiCaprio playing
the fiercely resistant and resourceful Hugh Glass. Will Mellor and
Domhall Gleeson, in spite of being more supporting players, do get
affective moments when they are operating in moments of emotional and
physical discomfort and totally selling it. And whilst I criticised his
voice, Tom Hardy's first Oscar-nomination for his acting is well
deserved - his body language and intent with the eyes is totally
spot-on. Fitzgerald is a character who has to be sold as real because
moments of deeper reason and nuance are sold off over the course of the
movie, but Hardy creates those moments of flipping it around - we see
him, after the initial attack by the Indians berating Glass and his
half-Indian son and saying incredibly vicious things and you begin to
hate him, then he pulls back his cap and reveals a big bald patch, from
where Indians had scalped him and pulls a look of total anger.
Immediately perception is flipped.In fact, Hardy and DiCaprio are playing really different to the kind of
characters they usually do; DiCaprio tends to fly best when he's
playing very dialogue heavy parts like Jordan Belfort, and Hardy is
very, VERY much a physical, body language type of performance. Here's
it's flipped, and Tom Hardy is given a majority of the dialogue and Leo
gets to work with very little and give a performance that is so
visceral and tortured that it's something almost beautiful; you are
totally behind him as he makes his long as hell journey back home. This
will be his Oscar winning performance, I'm sure of it: a performance
that is genuinely brilliant and not at all bait to boot.This movie is brilliant, but it is brutal, especially with that bear
attack scene: it's a continuous 5 minute shot of a man getting the hell
beaten out of him, and this bear is not holding back. This bear does
pretty much everything conceivable to him, and it's a groundbreaking
piece of Acting, Animation, Direction, Cinematography and Sound Design
that needs to be seen in Theatres. Right now; go see it!

Leonardo DiCaprio probably made this film for the sole purpose of
securing his first Oscar's, the man did the impossible this time, he
fought with a wild bear, slept inside the corpse of a dead horse, he
achieved a great job of performance this time so there's no excuse for
not giving him the trophy. The movie itself is of course awesome,
perfection and neatness clearly appear in every frame, every shot and
every detail, in music, editing, costumes, makeup, in every tiny detail
you can feel the hard work, however, and though its runtime is
relatively long, I think the movie lacks a strong backbone of a story,
it didn't focus enough on the romantic relationship between Leo and the
native American girl, we didn't know how they met or what brought her
in his way, it could dedicate a few minutes to the kidnapped tribal
girl and how she was rescued, there's not even a female protagonist!
I'd give Leo 9/10, the movie making 8/10 and the movie story 5/10.

First of all. Again a brilliant performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. I
have to admit, it's not really my kind of movie, but still it kept me
captivated till the very end, it's amazing how strong this mans will to
live is and how he shows the survival and the extraordinary power of
the human spirit, it is so amazing the thing he have to get thru to
survive. Almost hard to believe that this actually are Inspired by true
events. Guided by sheer will and the love of his family, he must
navigate a vicious winter in a relentless pursuit to live and find
redemption. it is simply a must see movie, brilliant acting from the
full cast, don't miss out of this great movie, simply a have to see
movie.

The Revenant, a ravishingly violent Western survival yarn from
Alejandro González Iñárritu, has a healthy few, scattered like acorns
across its two-and-a-half-hour canvas..... no matter how extended, the
film's tense story is under the director's complete
control...DiCaprio's performance is an astonishing testament to his
commitment to a role. cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki done a great
job..as a supporting actor tom hardy is brilliant.the movie is nominated for 12 Oscar. Leo has a big chance to win the
best actor and i thinks he deserves it. it's proves again Tom hardy is
a brilliant actor even he can do it as a villain.i just so much loved
this one,hope you like this one...

To put it simply: I just wasn't that moved by this movie. Didn't really
buy into Glass's relationships with his son or his wife, or what made
him such a good guy. Didn't understand his motivations basically.
Fitzgerald also wasn't as clear-cut a bad guy. This made later events
in the movie somewhat anticlimactic. The survival and loneliness and
determination were kind of one dimensional and boring.Revenant has impressive cinematography and depiction of survival but
without a compelling story underneath it kind of falls flat. Other
survival(ish) type movies (Cast Away, Cold Mountain, Last of the
Mohicans, even Lonesome Dove) have done better jobs of developing the
characters and relationships before throwing the main character out
alone into the lonely survival scenario. This way the audience can
understand and share the emotional impact of the main character's
suffering and what is behind his will to survive. When Tom Hanks lives off fish for 4 years with only a volleyball to
talk to, or W.P. Inman fends off the aftermath and both sides of the
Civil War to hike 400 miles through the back country, or Woodrow Call
drags a man's corpse 1500 mi back to Texas for burial, despite how
incredible it all is it is all the more moving because it makes sense
and we have an understanding of the relationships that exist as the
motivational sources. This makes the outcomes climactic and effective
as well.That is what Revenant lacks... It tries to establish a backstory for
characters and relationships via flashbacks and dreams while the
survival is unfolding. It just doesn't work. The father-son bond is
fairly well done but not the ones with the wife or the villain. Glass
is willing to freeze and claw through dirt and eat bugs and survive, we
get it, but don't really see why. For returning home and getting
revenge? As Fitzgerald states himself that alone won't "bring his boy
back," so all the suffering is kind of hard to identify with. This
problem extends to the theme/message- or lack thereof- for the film as
well.

I think this is a great movie.It's not just a movie, but it gives me a great experience. Beautiful
snow-covered mountains and lands, clear river, all pictures are so
great.However, it shows me not only beautiful pictures, but also exciting
fighting scenes, intense survival scenes, and sentimental human
relation story.And in this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio shows the best acting as ever he
did. Not only beautiful and strong, but sometimes acts very viciously,
sometimes very weak- human. This year, 2016, Leo was nominated in the Oscar. I hope he gets Oscar.

The Revenant, Alejandro Inarritu's epic story of survival and revenge
based somewhat loosely on the story of early 19th Century trappers in
the American West, brings the awe- inspiring beauty and spirit-crushing
physical hardship of that elemental time and place to the screen with
visceral power and visual grace. By using the outline of real events
surrounding trapper Hugh Glass and demanding the most of himself and
his production crew - as well as by sparing no expense (creating
controlled avalanches, for instance) - Inarritu has forcefully stamped
the daunting and morally complex reality of 19th Century frontier
existence onto the minds of 21st Century viewers. These motivations and
their creative expressions are effective and mostly honorable, if
sometimes overwrought and in a practical sense, unbelievable.The problems with this film, however, are significant, and they mostly
have to do with Inarritu's inability to get out of his own way. He
constantly imposes his vision of a lost human oneness with nature, and
with the superior moral and spiritual sensibilities of native or
indigenous peoples of times and places that are not tainted by Western
European and American capitalistic greed and depravity - and he does
this while still trying to keep the the spark of the survivalist and
revenge-oriented narrative fresh. It does not, in the end, all quite
work. The message of mammon's corruption of the raw, pristine, and yes,
virtuous is not a new one, much as it is countered by Inarritu's own
budget busting to provide such an impression and by the natural
instinct to improve upon the challenging conditions faced by the
trappers and natives that the film conveys. Moreover, the effort taken
in this lengthy visual endurance contest to maintain the mystical and
anti-Enlightenment vision while supporting the desire to
ever-so-tangibly enforce the difficulty of survival and the driving
energy of revenge becomes, sadly, dull and somewhat contrived. Inarritu
is also striving to use all the techniques of cinema he has gathered
from Herzog, Malick, Ozu, Ford and Eastwood (among perhaps many others)
to convey his point, with endless landscape cuts, shots of swaying
trees (whose trunks are strong...), beautiful low-light and even
night-time images (in what is a ridiculous scene near the end), and
agonizing close-ups that often result in the breath of the subject on
the lens of the camera (I have Leo's face memorized). But Inarritu does
not stop there: to further impose the native spirituality and
perspective that we are to believe that Hugh Glass has embraced, we see
images of bones piled high, back-lit scenes from the halcyon days of
Glass's companionship with a Native American wife and times of restful
bonding with his son. It is all just too much for the narrative to
carry, beautiful as the images are, taut as the concept of survival is
presented. The movie loses momentum and impact about halfway through. I
found myself waiting for the plot-driven denouement, understanding
pretty fully by then the theme Inarritu was trying to convey.Another aspect of this film is disturbing, and is related to Inarritu's
heavy-handed nature. He creates at least one character within the
central plot to further his thematic point and to increase the force of
the revenge motif. He is not true to the actual outcome of the story,
for which he can be forgiven since he never actually states that he is
providing a film based on fact. And he moves the settings from their
true location of the Glass saga, in sections of what is now
northwestern and central South Dakota in the US, to Canada, and even
Argentina. The flat and visually static great plains was apparently not
a good enough place to increase the survivalist drama for Inarritu, nor
to allow for endless upward shots of the swaying trees. However,
shooting in such a location might have given a brief economic benefit
to that poor area of the United States, perhaps providing a few
temporary jobs to Native Americans from local tribes. And working in
the true location might also have added some authenticity to the nature
of the survivalist struggle and paid a respectful tribute to the the
specific indigenous peoples that populate the story (Pawnee and
Arikara) and inspired the mystical ethics and spirituality to which
Inarritu wants us to believe he finds affinity.

In Iñárritu's sixth full length outing (his fourth English language
movie) he makes a change in direction, although much of his interest in
the human spirit and particularly the afterlife, fuelled presumably by
his Catholic upbringing in Mexico, remains in place. He describes The Revenant as a 'Grizzly thriller" and that's a fair
summation, although the pace is often really quite slow.What Iñárritu excels at is creating a mood of intimacy and foreboding
that characterises this epic journey from start to finish. In one sense
it's an unashamed star vehicle for Leonardo Di Caprio who must surely
sway the Academy judges to finally reward him with his long sought best
actor statue, for this is a truly remarkable and physical performance
from an actor that has deserved the formal acknowledgement of his peers
for several years.The photography, unaided by anything other than nature itself, is both
oppressive (often downright gloomy in the Albertan and British
Columbian winter) and intense. More than once Di Caprio's breath
unapologetically fogs the lens, so close is the filming. But it can
also be beautiful in its naturalistic capture of the rivers, and
particularly the forests, of its locations.The music by Ryuichi Sakamoto quite often dominates scenes with its
full orchestral chords booming across the barren and forlorn landscapes
that are doing their best to destroy Di Caprio's character, Hugh Glass.It's a tale of revenge, but more importantly of determination and faith
( in both the human spirit and in God). Iñárritu draws on religious
iconography, as he often does, to represent the afterlife because,
through much of the movie, death is either a sudden outcome for many of
the cast or is imminent for Glass. Recurring themes are the angelic
dream-state vision of his dead Native Indian wife floating in mid air
and an image of a foreboding hill of skulls (representing Golgotha, AKA
Calvary). These dream states sit alongside a number of set pieces (the
Grizzly fight in particular) in which special effects are put to quite
remarkable effect, but these are short episodes in what is essentially
a tortuous journey from near death.The story goes like this. A gang of 44 fur hunters/traders are attacked by a posse of Native
Indians seeking the daughter of the chief who has been taken by another
group of traders.These guys are in no mood for taking prisoners and lay waste to the fur
traders' settlement. We then follow a small band of trapper brothers
who escape (including Hugh Glass) but it quickly becomes apparent that
they are no harmonious group and one in particular, Fitzgerald, played
woefully in my opinion by Tom Hardy (really, his backwoodsman dialect
is unintelligible and this ruins nearly all of the narrative scenes in
the film), has money and self interest at heart. When Glass is attacked
and nearly killed by a Grizzly Bear Fitzgerald is left to look after
him, for a bounty, while the remaining group head back to the traders'
fortified settlement on the other side of the Rockies.Rather than looking after Glass, Fitzgerald abandons him, killing his
half-cast son and sets off to reclaim his bounty. What follows is a
long and tortuous adventure as Glass seeks refuge back at camp. It's a
Bear Grylls expedition of monumental proportions with plenty of
adventure, much misery and very little in the way of food.This isn't Iñárritu's best movie (despite all the awards). There are
serious flaws in the believability of Glass' survival techniques and
Tom Hardy knocks a full point off my rating for his irritating and
wilfully obscure, frankly preposterous, dialect. But put that to one side and you have an adventure epic that bears
little comparison. It hangs onto Iñárritu's art-house sensitivities and
it serves up a number of fantastic scenes that will stick long in the
viewer's mind.I give it a 7/10. Sorry Tom. You blew it.

First time I have reviewed a film and what better film to make my debut
than this one. The acting is top draw ,Tom Hardy is fast becoming one
of the best actors around and Leo is as good as ever. The bear scene is
amazing , how that was made and brought to the big screen was truly
remarkable along with the horse scene going off the cliff .The
surroundings to the movie must have made filming so difficult This is a
must watch movie for the true film buff for so many reasons . Watch it
and be amazed ,simple plot with quality in all departments, plenty of
action with a superb ending .Hope the Oscars are kind to this film
because it deserves it .

After last year's astounding Birdman, which came to be one of my
favourite movies of all time, I was looking forward to A. Iñárritu's
new collaboration with the cinematographer E. Lubezki. And sadly, it
fell a bit short of my exaggerated expectations.From the standpoint of cinematography, Revenant is expectedly gorgeous.
Beautiful environments (shot with natural lighting!), gritty realism of
the depicted situations, scenes shot from unusual perspectives -
everything is as close to perfection as possible.However, as for the movie's plot and themes, everything turned out to
be disappointingly straightforward. It's just a revenge tale. No subtle
nuances, no amendments to the classic conception. Besides, I'd say it
has some issues with the motivation of the Indian tribe that's hunting
the protagonists for a good part of the movie. What is more, while the
overall pacing is good for a 2,5+ hours-long movie, it does drop after
the first hour noticeably only to pick up around half an hour later.As for acting, everything is done professionally - both the lead and
secondary role actors perform admirably, but as for DiCaprio, I
honestly think he's had stronger and more interesting roles than having
to growl, squirm, crawl and breath heavily for two and a half hours
straight.In the end, it's a wonderfully acted, breathtakingly filmed,
meticulously polished classic tale about a man overcoming all obstacles
imaginable to revenge the death of his loved ones, with no twists or
additions plot-wise. Is it a good movie? Yes, definitely, very much so.
But is it Oscar-worthy? We will find out this February, but I
personally wouldn't say so.

The Revenant, let me start off by saying if you search The Revenant
here on IMDb you get 3 different films in 6 years, crazy huh? I filmed
one with David Anders and I had a fantastic, fun time doing so it was
my first hands on production job that I will never forget. This
Revenant is a whole different kinda badass, The story of the Ashley Fur
Co. On an American expedition of sorts to find pelts, trust me if you
walk into the theater hot, this film should cool you off real quick.
The story of Hugh Glass I guess is one of intrigue and mystery, the
part of the story that is etched in history is that Hugh Glass a
frontiersman that is great at hunting, and tracking for exploration
purposes gets caught up alone and suffers a bear attack, he take the
bear down with him but is torn to pieces and literally hanging on to
life by a thread. The Revenant Stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass,
yes this review is written just after the Golden Globes and he won Best
Actor, yes, the man deserves it without a shadow of a doubt. The
performance that he gave was absolutely superb from beginning to end,
this why he has awards and lots of money, and well I don't. I usually
sometimes agree that many a actor could have been cast and still done a
great job in the film, but in this case I have to say casting was,
perfect. Tom Hardy cast as Fitzgerald, the man responsible for taking
care of him after the bear attack and well, he has his own agenda and
things for him take a dark turn when he murders Hugh Glasses son right
in front of him, call it yes it was an accident of sorts, but he wanted
to look out for himself and didn't care what happened to Hugh, or Hawk,
his son played by Forrest Goodluck. The vision came from
Writer/Director Alejandro G. Inarritu, it was filmed in Canada I'm
guessing surely in the winter, the visuals that he gives you are
superb, this film makes you feel the cold, feel the death around you
with the despair in the 1820's. When it's cold, it's hard to get warm,
especially when you have, NOTHING. This film shows that a bearskin,
having small fires and very little to eat was how it worked back then,
unless your in luck and the families rich. The film was great to me
that hopefully this new generation gets to see and feel what it's like
to not have, oh I don't no, everything they have today they take for
granted, damn just take the wifi away from a teen for a few hours and
watch the despair set in, let alone a roof, food, and warmth during the
winter months. Domhnall Gleeson gives a good performance as the
Captain, and what can be said of Tom Hardy, superb performances all
around giving this film exactly what it needed, the perfect blend of a
great story, great acting, and superb set and film work. Alejandro has
done it again, Babel and Birdman were exceptional films, this director
is the hot ticket now, I just hope he continues and doesn't have a
massive bomb in the next few years. It would be a pleasure to work with
him, it would have been an honor to work on this The Revenant, I'm sure
top to bottom are pleased with they're work. If your looking for a
great story, great directing and superb acting, look no further then
The Revenant.

Firstly a criticism - it's just a bit too long and realistically you
have to suspend belief at DiCaprio's survival in such extreme
conditions.But despite that, this is a very good movie and really does benefit
from seeing it on the big screen. The locations and cinematography are
just absolutely stunning! Good solid story - although quite simple. The
acting is top quality. I have no doubt DiCaprio will get the Oscar for
his starring role. Don't think the movie will get Best Picture - it's
up against stiff competition. I'm in awe of just how this movie was
filmed in such conditions!!! The scenes with the bear will leave you
breathless and open-mouthed! Undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2015
and deserves your time. If your attention wanes at times, just admire
the scenery and locations - that's what I did! I have no hesitation in recommending this movie. It has appeal for all
ages and tastes.

Leo deserve to get Oscar for his role this year. However I believe he
should have gotten it for his Wolf of Wallstreet role. He proved he
would do anything to get it, and hopefully he will because he deserves
it. I should admit in the middle you get bored and are seeking to
persuade yourself how in the world he is still alive despite all the
horrible things happen to him. Cinematography was amazing. They really
did a great job in shooting the scenes with details. They show blood,
sun, trees, sky, wild life, pain all in one shot. That helps you to
feel the paradox of life as you see the movie. You have a clear vision
of the surrounding. The scene in which the bear mauled Leo was
outstanding, very vivid. Editing was also great. Overall it worth your
time and money. Well done Revent crew.

Good but not superior. Spectacular mountainous scenery was a great
asset as was the realism. Di Caprio's performance was impressive
considering he had so few lines and a number of those were
unintelligible. What troubled me, and I am sure very few others, is
that the Pawnees lived in non-mountainous Nebraska far, far away from
those towering peaks and tall firs. If the Indians were Blackfeet of
Montana or Canada, it would have been reasonable. I should think such
an item should have been researched. This film would rate high as far
as violence and suffering go. Di Caprio was mauled, shot, stabbed, and
practically drowned and frozen. The faces of the actors were so
obscured by hair that it was sometimes difficult to tell who was who.
The ending was not definitive, but fit in with the course of the movie.
An off beat, but enjoyable picture.

The story is mainly one about fellowship, revenge, love and most of all
survival. You can easily put The Revenant in the same line as the
biographical dramas Into The Wild (Sean Penn, 2007) or 127 Hours (Danny
Boyle, 2010).Next to DiCaprio the film also stars Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road) as
the treacherous FitzimagesJJSAYF8Ygerald, who is an opportunist liar
and the Irish Domhnall Gleeson (Harry Potter & the Deathly Hollows Part
II) as the reliable captain of the team. Fresh young talent is Forrest
Goodluck, who plays Glass's half-blood Indian son Hawk. The Revenant is
Goodluck's first feature film, in which he proves his ability to show
authentic emotions and speak several languages (English and Caddoan).
Rumours had it that part of the cast suffered from hypothermia during
the shooting. In fact, the back to the roots atmosphere of the film
shows us what it is to be cold and indirectly makes us shiver as we
watch. I could almost feel the ice-cold wind on my back.Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity, Sleepy Hollow) shows us the
beauty of nature and in the same time its power to destroy. The film is
shot partly in Canada and Argentina, to assure snowy landscapes.
Lubezki catches every glaring sunbeam in the most aesthetic way. A
viewer cannot be anything but moved by the peacefulness these images
show in contrast to the roughness and pain these men experience.Although The Revenant is about survival-of-the-fittest in the most
primitive way, some scenes may be disturbing, due to the violence and
explicit skinning and eating of animals. None of them really got
spared, so when you are a fundamental vegetarian or vegan, please don't
watch the 156 minutes long The Revenant, because some shots might be
repelling. Iñárritu opted for the most naturalist way of representing
reality. DiCaprio goes full-on in his performance, grunting, groaning,
killing and guts-eating, and therefore won his award at the Golden
Globes. Once again he proves himself to be an multi-talented actor on
his way to an Oscar (-pretty please!)

I Recently watched The Revenant directed by Alejandro Gonzalez and my
mind was blown away. The movie stared Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy.
Terrific film from beginning to end and kept me sitting on the edge of
my seat the whole entire time. This movie is purely about Survival and
Endurance, and Leo performed beautifully in this flick. Tom Hardy also
blew my mind with his acting skills and he has made his way up to my
list of actors to pay attention to from here on out. Also If you've
seen any of Alejandro Gonzalez's films then you understand that he is
very keen on shots and angles. Not to mention that Emmanuel Lubezki is
a genius with using natural light for this movie. Straight up the last
scene of this movie sent chills down my spine, and out of all the
glorious shots, it was my favorite. The only complaint that I would
have about the movie is that it had a small pacing problem. And there
were two scenes in particular where I felt that some characters made
incredibly dumb and unrealistic decisions for the sake of plot
convenience. All in all though solid 9/10. Definitely going to be in my
top for 2016. I'm already calling it. This movie was the most beautiful
movie i've seen since Blade Runner.

'The Revenant' is a rare, perfect feature epic that is a must see for
all those film buffs that yearn for a movie where the experience
becomes an event. Films such as this are just not made, simply put in
the 'too hard' basket because of the dedication that is required to
pull off such a cinematic production. Only the very best in their
chosen field can give such a story any justice and for once, Hollywood
have got it right. So right in fact, that when I entered the theatre, I
wasn't sure if I really wanted to be there. I was afraid that such a
production wouldn't live up to my expectations but after the violent
and intense opening scenes, my anxiety was quickly put to rest. I knew
this was going to be an epic event and judging by the resounding
silence by the audience, they knew it as well. Everyone had forgotten
that they were cradling popcorn or holding their coke. All eyes were
riveted to the screen and that is where they stayed for the rest of the
movie.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a modern day genius. His sublime vision
as a Director could only have resulted in this masterpiece that will
long be remembered as one of the great visceral narratives of all time.
The commitment, the detail, the patience and the confronting realism
that it took to bring 'The Revenant' to life is a minor miracle in
itself. What Inarritu keeps doing as a Director is his obvious ability
to take mammoth risks not for his own glory but to genuinely give the
audience a film that they will remember. His use of natural light
compliments the vastness of the environment that he places this story
in, so much so, that 'The Revenant's' spectacular backdrop is
undoubtedly an extra cast member. The whole spectacle of Inarritu's
film is breathless.Partly based on Michael Punke's book, the audience is immediately
thrust into nineteenth century America, where the frontier is wild and
dangerous to say the least. Legendary Explorer, Hugh Glass (Leonardo Di
Caprio), leads a party of fur trappers into the unknown so they can go
about their business of stripping the hides off the local wildlife. It
isn't long before they are all set upon by native Pawnee Indians and a
brutal and bloody clash ensues. With an intense and hasty retreat, the
expedition finds themselves at the mercy of the harsh frontier
environment. With the Pawnee closing in on their trail, the men must
walk out of the wilderness on foot. Glass is ferociously attacked by a
bear that leaves him within a half breath of his life. To make matters
worse, the men desert him, leaving just his half breed son, Hawk
(Forrest Goodluck), a young trapper named Bridger (Will Poulter) and
the dangerous and conniving John Fitzgerald to look after him.
Fitzgerald takes matters into his own hands and leaves Glass for dead,
disposing of his son before fleeing with Bridger in toe. What results
is an incredible tale of survival and revenge against insurmountable
odds and a journey into the very depths of one man's soul as he fights
his way out of the shadows and into the very personal realm of
vengeance.Leonardo Di Caprio is mesmerising as he fabricates one of the greatest
performances ever seen on film. His involvement in the bear attack is
worth the price of admission on its own. The reality of this murderous
attack is extremely confronting but lays the platform for this
extraordinary man's quest to live at all costs. Di Caprio has been at
the top of his game for a while now but his complete transformation as
Hugh Glass will long go down in cinematic history. The man is on
another level and if he is not recognised by the Academy for this
performance then it will be a travesty. Tom Hardy is the perfect
adversary to Di Caprio's Glass. Fitzgerald is a sinister character
where money is his only motive and Hardy plays him to perfection with
his mumbling delivery of the dialogue only adding to the suspense. Tom
is not afraid to explore his dark side and there is no doubt that he
does this so well.'The Revenant' is a must see film. Such a movie comes along once in a
generation and it will be some time before we see anything remotely
like this production. It is violent in parts and the reality of the
story is confronting for the audience as we watch Glass fight and
struggle to survive. But it is worth it.

This film is about Hugh Glass played brilliantly by Leonardo DiCaprio.
He plays a frontiersman who after a bear attack gets buried alive and
left for dead. He then goes a survival quest in search of revenge.
Firstly the look of this movie is so amazing. The cinematography is
some of the most beautiful to look at I've ever seen. The acting is
really solid. Leo is incredible what he has to go through to survive in
the wilderness is something to behold. He shows a lot of emotional
depth and you can really feel his fight for survival. Tom Hardy is also
great as the man who Hugh seeks revenge on. The score in this film is
also really beautiful. The direction is amazing also from the director
of Birdman. Its amazing to follow up a masterpiece with another one.
This film is really interesting and has a lot of great stuff going for
it. Again the cinematography is top notch, the acting is first class
and the music is really well used. This is one of the best films of the
year. It could easily win best picture at the Oscars. I highly
recommend it,

Alexander Gonzales Iñaritu is one of the best film directors of the
last past years. I always knew that the Birdman director will one day
make a masterpiece, that will go down in film history as one of the
finest movies ever made. It seems like this day has come.The Revenant is approximately two and a half hours long, yet no single
second is boring. The plot is about a group of trappers, led by Andrew
Henry (played by Domhnall Gleeson), hunting for fur. On one day, famous
trapper Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is attacked and almost
killed by a Bear. One of the hunters, John Fitzgerald (played by Tom
Hardy), betrays and him buries him alive. However, Glass survives. I
don't want to spoil more about the plot.The acting in the Revenant is incredible. Leonardo DiCaprio just has to
win an Oscar for this. His commitment to this film goes so far, that,
for example, he even ate real raw buffalo liver, among other extreme
actions he did for his role. Tom Hardy always was an OK actor, in my
opinion. He is neither one of the best nor worst, just a normal good
actor. But in this movie is performance was absolutely brilliant.
Definitely his best performance to date. I like Domhnall Gleeson since
I saw Ex Machina, last year. His performance in the Revenant was also
very good.But the best part of the Revenant aren't the actors, but the visuals.
Emmanuel Lubeski is the mastermind behind the amazing camera in this
film. Sometimes the movie shows breathtaking scenery, other times
shocking brutality. The shots are sometimes two minutes long (or maybe
even longer) without a single cut. The soundtrack is very fitting, but
not memorable outside the film.To sum it up, the Revenant is an epic masterpiece with great acting,
fitting music, and one of the best visuals I have even seen in movie
history. It should at least win the Oscars for Best Actor in a lead
role, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and maybe even Best Actor
in a supporting role and Best Picture. However, the story is a bit
predictable. 9/10

Spectacular? Wonderful? Joy for the eyes? Feast for the mind? I find it
difficult to give the precise words to describe this movie that was
truly a shocking (in a good way) experience for me. The true art movie
is not dead. That is what comes to my mind after seeing this movie.
Journey through a mans heart, strive to survive, revenge, regret,
sorrow - everything is here, not to mention spectacular work of camera
man (it was a true joy to my eyes to see these beautiful scenes).
Philosophy of mankind, brutality that has no excuses - so much to think
of and of course - Leonardo playing the role of this carrier. I must
admit I was never a big girly fan of his, but after this - well, Leo -
you are genius. This is his role. Big thanks to the director and script
writer - you make me believe that true films are not dead.Love it!

Have you ever been so mad at someone you wanted to crawl 80-200 miles
to kill them? The Revenant Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy and is
directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu who directed Birdman one of my
favourite movies from 2014. Dicaprio plays Hugh Glass, a frontiersman
who is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his hunting team. Based on
a true story The Revenant is set in Montana/South Dakota in 1823. This
movie is absolutely gorgeous! Nearly every shot is a thing of beauty. I
loved the story and the dedication of DiCaprio in the freezing cold
temperatures (he actually ate a raw bison liver to better understand
the character). My main issue with the film is in the 2nd act where he
is enroute to get his revenge on the people who left him behind. With
little to no dialogue and minimal major scenes this portion seemed to
drag on a bit making the 2hr 36min runtime feel even longer. That is my
only concern with the film it is stunningly beautiful and a very great
story based on truth. That is why I give The Revenant an A- (8/10)

When I heard the plot synopsis, it sure sounded familiar. Then it came
to me. This is a remake of Richard Harris' 1971 movie, "Man in the
Wilderness". This is a quote from the IMDb entry for "Man in the
Wilderness", In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers and Indian
traders are returning with their goods to civilization and are making a
desperate attempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide Zachary Bass
is injured in a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and leave him
behind to die. When he recovers instead, he swears revenge on them and
tracks them and their paranoiac expedition leader down. So, pretty much
all of the basic story structure is the same. Wilderness, bear,
abandonment, survival, quest for revenge, etc etc. The earlier movie
was a pretty good movie, cold and gritty, so I guess I will go see how
well Leo did in the role.

Inarritu's directorial style, including the patented long single takes,
the lack of music during action sequences, and of course, his choice of
camera work, allows for viewers to feel like as if they had just
witnessed something real. I came out of the theater feeling like I had
just witnessed a video recording of a real massacre, or a real bear
mauling and of course, a real journey of a man on a mission--a mission
to survive and get revenge on a man who left him for dead. The Revenant
is a fantastic experience and felt extremely realistic, but
unfortunately, the film fell short in several categories.For a revenge tale, I found it to be a bit melodramatic, and I just
didn't have that same emotional attachment to the story like I had with
movies such as Gladiator or Dances With Wolves. Don't get me wrong, I
loved Tom Hardy's performance, he stole every scene, but a lot of his
role was entirely improvised on his part and I heard that he didn't
even read the script for this film. As good as he was, I much would've
preferred a more complex villain, with a deeper back-story and a deeper
personal dynamic with the protagonist. Speaking of the protagonist, I thought DiCaprio was superb, and if he
ever wins an Oscar, I'd clap for him because he deserves it not only
for his expressive but silent acting, but for his stunts too.
Supposedly, Leonardo DiCaprio was actually forced to endure an
immersion into an ice-cold freezing river, a real blizzard and he even
ate raw meat. He'll be nominated for this role and the film will have
garnered many nominations come next month, but I'm not sure it will
rack up any wins in the screenplay department. I loved the beautiful
Indian proverbs sprinkled throughout the story but it was lacking in
character development. All in all, a visceral, cringe-worthy experience, and a movie that I
would surely watch again despite being a bit longer in run-time than
necessary. I also thought that there was a lot more CGI in the film
than I expected, especially when it came to the wild-life. I was hoping
to see dozens of horses on the screen at once, a real herd of buffalo,
or a real pack of wolves, but there wasn't any. However, despite that
minor gripe, I thought the set design, art direction, make-up, props,
and the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. Do yourself a favor and
watch this film in the theater for the best effect. I give the Revenant
an 8 out of 10, two points short of a masterpiece!

Thoroughly enjoyed this picture, although I thought I would catch
pneumonia before it ended. If this was based on a true story, I am
surprised the hero didn't catch pneumonia; this was the coldest-feeling
film I ever watched.In a more serious vein, I am with the majority of reviewers who saw
"The Revenant" and praised it profusely. It is worth every award it
will garner and I wouldn't be surprised if Leonardo DiCaprio won an
Oscar for his portrayal of the tormented trapper, Hugh Glass. DiCaprio
continues to impress as a serious actor who improves with each picture
he makes, and is on the threshhold of becoming Hollywood's best actor.By now the film has been summarized endlessly, but I just wanted to add
one complaint, and that is that the picture is too long by about 40
minutes. This did not detract from my enjoyment, however, as I
appreciate solid movie-making over lowest-common-denominator tripe
prevalent on modern movie screens.

I just want to say go and watch this movie.Period. Stunning all the way
around. If you have a weak stomach then do not go (although you should
challenge yourself because this is a fine great cinematography long cut
that you do not want to miss). Gritty, intense, bloody, raw and
emotions stirrer. I did not see something that glued me on the seat at
this point since years. Mr Di Caprio is doing an amazing job and he
deserves all the awards according to me but also Mr. Hardy is not less
at all. Huge credit to the director Alejandro González Iñárritu and all
the crew that allowed this movie to be so alive. So...go and watch and
buckle up yourself for this non stopping sequence of overwhelming
moments and images. This is of course a movie adaptation of a real
story but everything works fine to me. The main character is
experiencing a number of extreme situations in the wilderness and the
special part is that you can almost feel what he feels in the body and
heart. I call this mastery in movie making.

It's not very often that you see an actor engaged in a gory struggle
with a CGI bear (or any other animal for that matter) in a film and
manage to make it utterly convincing and disturbing. DiCaprio does
exactly that and in the process makes you wonder if it's actually a
real bear. This scene takes place in the first 20 minutes and is the
"major event" in the film that results in our protagonist being nearly
dead with gashes in several places which includes one in the throat
that would let out all the water if he drinks it, and a broken leg.
There were multiple occasions where I gasped in horror and made me
wonder how they pulled off those sequences. DiCaprio's performance is
so frightfully realistic and dominating that I hope they finally give
him the elusive Best Actor trophy that he badly deserves.In one of my cinema discussions sometime ago with a friend of mine, we
talked about how the most good-looking male actors in Hollywood might
have a hard time trying to get someone to seriously consider their
hidden acting skills as well and that they are not just a bunch of
pretty faces trying to sell a film to mainstream audiences. Would they
excel in meaty and dark roles? The names that came up, naturally, were
Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and DiCaprio's. We both came to the conclusion
that this generalization doesn't apply to DiCaprio as he is one of
these "pretty boys" who can rise above that definition and has the
ability to dismantle the so-called "playboy" image accorded to him by
many and exceed our expectations in the acting department. He has been
doing that for a while and is noticeably getting better with every
film.My full review can be read at:https://projectedperspectives.wordpress.com/

I am left speechless by this movie. You've seen the trailers, you know
how amazing it looked. Yeah, it was even better. This was easily one of
the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. It was just
mindblowing! The bear attack scene was in one long take! How amazing is
that? My favorite part of the movie? The whole movie! This is easily
one of the best films I've ever seen!Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic, giving a grueling physical performance.
This whole movie is grueling, it's intense. This is easily one of the
most brutal films I've ever seen. I never thought a movie from 2015
could get more intense than Sicario, and I was wrong. This may be the
most intense movie I've seen....ever. It's just so good! Tom Hardy is
great in it, couldn't understand a word he was saying, but he was
great!I'm sorry if this review is really unfocused and all over the place,
but it's hard to express in words what I just saw. Everyone just needs
to see this themselves. Alejandro González Iñárritu has made 2 films in
a row that have completely blown me away (with this being MILES better
than Birdman), I seriously can't wait to see what he'll do next. He may
be one of the greatest directors of all time.10/10, best movie of 2015.

From thequickflickcritic.blogspot.com/ Academy Award winner Alejandro González Iñárritu ("Birdman") directed,
co-wrote and co-produced "The Revenant" with the indisputable intent of
transporting his audience back to the primitive and animalistic
conditions inherent to the brutal and untamed North American wilderness
of the early 19th Century. Having experienced this masterpiece in
modern filmmaking now myself, I feel qualified to deliver the following
declaration in the most resounding manner possible...MISSION
ACCOMPLISHED!!! With each stunning scene of grim grandeur Iñárritu passed before my
eyes, I was unwaveringly riveted, hurtled headlong, swept into every
successive moment, captivated in a whirling dervish of surging
vitality.From ultra-violent Native (and non-indigenous) American ambushes, to
excruciatingly crude cleansing of heinous bodily wounds, to a Grizzly
Bear mauling that for all the world appears to be ACTUALLY happening, I
was rendered at once exhausted and exhilarated in the wake of a
furiously unrelenting assault on my emotions.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the role of his career as real-life
frontier legend Hugh Glass, "The Revenant" is a ferociously ambitious
epic, presented essentially in three distinct acts: Escape, Survival
and Revenge. Tom Hardy's perfect performance as reprehensible
antagonist and the reviled target of Glass's relentless scorn, John
Fitzgerald, serves to further solidify the richly gifted actor,
together with DiCaprio, among the genuine elite of their craft.There is a deeply effecting, albeit brief, Epilogue to "The Revenant",
as the nearly two and a half hours of full-force frenzy that has
preceded it comes to a movingly quiet climax.An unspeakably tortured soul has found peace. At the end of a long and
agonizing odyssey, and at long last, enduring peace.For more of my Movie Reviews categorized by Genre please visit:

Another excellent film from Alejandro G. Inarritu with this one. Not
really much of a surprise seeing as how this guy makes some of the best
movies out there right now. I was introduced to this director with
Biutiful and I've been a fan ever since. This film gives us more of the
depressing scenes that Inarritu is known for but it's ultimately a
hopeful tale. It's hard to believe that it's actually based off of a
true story and that someone actually managed to survive some of what is
portrayed in the movie. Just surviving the first twenty minutes would
be an amazing feat for me. Let's talk about the plot.The story revolves around the tracker and frontiersman Hugh Glass
(Leonardo DiCaprio). Glass and his son are helping a group of trappers
in the wilderness when they are attacked by Indians and forced to flee
into the woods. As if he wasn't already having a bad enough day he ends
up being attacked by a grizzly bear and is horribly mauled and nearly
dead. Glass is being taken care of when a man named Fitzgerald (Tom
Hardy) decides to go ahead and kill him so that he can get out of there
and go home. Glass's son witnesses the event and is murdered by
Fitzgerald and Glass is left alone in the woods to fend for himself.
Somehow, Glass finds the strength to not only get up and start walking
again, but sets out to find his way back to the fort where the
trappers, and Fitzgerald, are staying.All of the actors are at the top of their game in this one, which is to
be expected in an Inarritu film. Leo does most of the movie by himself
but his emotions come out perfectly in his face and movements and it's
never difficult to know what he's thinking. It' s easy to see the pain
in his face and it makes me wonder if the conditions were so crappy
that it wasn't just acting. At least we know the shivering couldn't
have been fake. Tom Hardy also does a fantastic job as amoral John
Fitzgerald. There are times when Fitzgerald is willing to help others
but it's really only when it benefits him in some way. He's actually a
despicable human being and it's easy to hate the guy, which goes to
show how well Hardy did in his portrayal of him. Domhnall Gleeson and
Will Poulter also give some excellent portrayals but I'm afraid they'll
be forgotten because of Leo and Hardy being the main focus and taking
up a lot more screen time.This film is absolutely gorgeous and it's easy to forget that places
like this still exist in the world. There weren't any sets used in this
movie. This is all natural and, if what I read is accurate, the movie
was filmed in Canada and Argentina. It's beautiful but it's easy to see
why the area is so dangerous. It's amazing to think that someone could
actually survive in the wilderness after being mauled by a bear but
Glass managed to do it. Just to add to the feeling of realism it seems
that most of the film was made using natural light. It boggles my mind
just how good this movie looks without using a lot of the camera tricks
that Hollywood is known for.I absolutely loved everything about this film but I know it won't be
for everyone. For one thing, this movie is very long and there isn't
much in the way of witty banter. Glass is mostly by himself and his
journey home is harrowing but it takes its time getting there. Those of
you with a short attention span might have a bit of trouble with one.
Also, the movie has plenty of action but it is not romanticized in any
way. This is just straight up brutality and the hero doesn't exactly
escape with minimal injuries. No one does really.Like I said before, the film is excellent but it's not for everyone.
When I left the theater there was complete silence from everyone
walking out. It's one of those types of movies that leaves you a bit
stunned after watching it. I can't help but recommend it but make sure
you're able to handle what the film will throw at you.

The Revenant is exactly what the title of this review says it is.
Without a doubt this film is magnificent. First let me begin by saying
this film has become far more innovative cinematography wise. The shots
and lighting was brilliant. The opening shot was truly awesome in my
mind. This really ups the ante for cinematography in dramatic thriller
films. I haven't seen anything that may be able to top this. Besides
the cinematography of the film, the sound is incredible. The score and
the sound effects were amazing. I would go to iTunes right now and
purchase the score just to feel like I'm up in Canada fishing by a
raging river in the middle of the woods. I can only describe as
incredible. The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy is truly
great work, especially Tom Hardy. Domnhall Gleeson is also great in
this film. I firmly believe this film will get nominated for a large
number of Oscars and give Leo his first. The story was easy to follow
with its multiple sub-plots. It's amazing how it all unravels in the
end. Following the story of Hugh Glass, it seems crazy to believe that
someone can endure so much and still live to fight. If you are reading
this and you have some open time in your schedule go see The Revenant.
I'll probably see it a few more times.

Ever since I saw the previews, I have been trying to place this plot,
story with one of the more shocking films I saw as a kid. Man in the
Wilderness. This is kind of a remake of that film and for me it impacts
my impression of this film. I can still remember Richard Harris'
performance which left an impression with me. I think it still impacts
how I feel about being out in the woods. John Huston's performance also
comes back right away. Well after plugging this old version, now to this film. It is very
good. It all appears believable when you are watching it, but it is so
much a crazy miracle for that to have happened. I remember the change
of seasons in the old one......this one not so much. So the distance
and the period of time in the Revenant is different than for Man in the
Wilderness. He doesn't appear to have been as far away from the fort as
portrayed. I read about the actors putting up with difficult conditions
making the film. I can believe that. The attack is very believable. The
persistence of his comrades to help him surprises me in this film. I
thought life was cheap back then and the others in the party
questioning their potential demise would have been enough to abandon
this man.If you have spent any time in the woods, in the winter, you'd know that
the conditions are deadly. We hunt in freezing conditions in November
and without all of my supplies, water, food and warming up each day
that'd do me in in a day or two. Really, getting wet and being in that
cold one time would probably do a person in and it happens to this
fellow numerous times. I kept thinking he'd lose a foot fingers, etc,
but he didn't.So, after a long, boring rambling review, I'd say I like this film, but
too much unbelievable things in it for me.

I read some reviews on here and they are pretty mixed, i however loved
this movie. I didn't miss a second of it. I guess i am getting tired of
the Hollywood action movies with a teenage romance aspect filled with
tons of jokes made by men with no touch of reality, like the new Star
Wars movie that was utterly butchered.Di caprio and Hardy's acting alone is awesome but so is Domnhall
Gleeson. I want more movies of this kind, i am tired of the light
action love comedy movies that Hollywood spew out thousands of each
year. I don't get why the kids don't grow tired of seeing the same
thing, wheter it takes place in space or in school or at a police
station.This movie was totally my taste and i couldn't get enough, had no
problem whatsoever with the lenght of it either.

The Revenant is a Western drama film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom
Hardy. Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu (Birdman), it features some
amazing cinematography and one of Leo's best performances to date.In 1823, a group of trappers and hunters are searching for pelts in the
unsettled wilderness of Louisiana. One of the group's lead hunters,
Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) stumbles upon a mother grizzly bear and
her two cubs. Glass is then brutally mauled by the bear and is mortally
wounded in the attack. Glass is left behind to die by the rest of his
hunting group at the suggestion of John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who
claims that carrying Glass with them will only slow them down. However,
Glass overcomes some of his minor injuries and slowly but surely
attempts to make it back to civilisation.This film is violent, unnerving and sometimes hard to watch, so I don't
recommend it to those with a weak stomach. However, if you feel you can
handle it, I should also mention that the film is filled with beautiful
cinematography and a sense of realism that is quite rare in motion
pictures today. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another brilliant performance
in the lead role. If he doesn't at least earn an Oscar nomination, then
I will be very surprised. Tom Hardy was great as well, it's always
satisfying to see him play villainous characters so well.I rate it 8/10.

Evidently, director Alejandro González Iñárritu is not one to rest on
his laurels. Having won last year's Best Picture and Best Director for
Birdman, I can't even imagine what sort of pressure Iñárritu underwent
to remain consistent but it shows. Painstakingly crafted and expertly
told, The Revenant is a visceral engagement of the senses unlike
anything we have seen from the director. Co-scripted by Iñárritu, this partly based true story tells of
frontiersman Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a group of fur trappers
set in the icy wilderness of 1820s South Dakota. In a breathtaking
opening montage, Glass and his hunting party are ambushed by
Native-American Arikara Indians. Outnumbered and chased by the Arikara,
the group decides to return to base with Glass being the navigator.
Expedition member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) disagrees with the plan
and an instant enmity is born. Between increasing hostility on their
way back, Glass is attacked by a grizzly bear in what has to be one of
the most brutal, terrifying and uncut scenes in a film. Having barely
survived the attack, and certain that Glass won't make it back alive,
Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) orders Fitzgerald to lead the
expedition back. Glass's half Native-American son Hawk (Forrest
Goodluck) and another young man Bridger (Will Poulter) are tasked with
staying behind and ensuring a proper burial. But when Fitzgerald
volunteers to stay behind too, it's obvious to the viewer that no good
deed can from this. Thus begins a traumatic tale of survival but also
revenge when Glass learns of Fitzgerald's heinous intentions. At little over 150 minutes, this is a long film and not for everyone.
From cauterizing his wounds to what Glass must do to survive,
Iñárritu's remarkable achievement in this film is his relentless method
of conveying the unthinkable. Between extreme cold conditions and
eating raw meat, this is DiCaprio in his most challenging delivery. And
although he doesn't say much, his role is physically demanding to such
an extent, they might as well hand him an Oscar for exhibiting a
genuine impetus to do just about anything. But DiCaprio is just one
component in an overall strikingly beautiful film.While the sheer audio-visual experience is consistently mind-blowing,
it comes down to Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography as the single most
significant aspect of this film. From tracking shots of landscapes to a
character's widening pupils by a camp fire, the soul of this film is
undeniably in its visual appeal. Such is the astounding nature of his
shots that the only other way to describe it is as if the lens is
omnipresent. After consecutive Academy Awards for Gravity and Birdman,
it won't be surprising if Lubezki is in for hat-trick. As Iñárritu's most ambitious film, The Revenant doesn't disappoint and
even with its somber tone and length, there isn't a single dull moment.
If anything, the entire film is an exhaustive experience but positively
riveting, terrifying, and haunting  like something that has returned
from the dead and won't go back.

Excellent acting, as expected by Leonardo and Tom Hardy and the crew.
This is a movie to be watched on the Big Screen. The scenes, the camera
work; all marvelous stuff. At no point the viewer gets any Boredom
bells for sure. Coming to the title "The Revenant" meaning coming back
from dead, I couldn't think of anything more suitable than this. A
beautiful show of how Glass comes back from being almost dead. It's the
will power and love for his son whose death he has to avenge, that
makes him able to stand back on his feet. The viewer cant help but
smile at display of such a strong bond. The way Leonardo does it, his
every move every expression; it's just WOW! At first I took it to be a
Horror Movie (of which I am no fan) since I hadn't seen the trailer.
But as the story unfolds, the thriller gets you fixed to the screen.
Also need not mention, but I'll mention again it's a simple but a
beautiful story. There is a villain and a hero. But one thing I
despised the most was the death of the Captain at the end. Come on! he
didn't need to die! Other than his death it's the Happy Ending! And we
all love happy endings, don't we? But the ending of this movie leaves
you thinking whether to be happy or not. The revenge is taken,Glass
survives but he's alone, his son and wife have died; what now? (This
you realize in the last dialogues of Tom Hardy.) But well Glass will
have his Inner Peace at least. So go and watch!

... and 1/3 very good.If it had ended about 30 minutes earlier I would rate it happily
100/100. Don't get me wrong: I was absorbed into its thrilling ending
like anybody else, but it doesn't hide the fact that a heartbreaking
story about surviving through the memory of love, changes into a
thrilling revenge showdown, which is brilliantly done, but nothing you
wouldn't see in any Tarantino movie.So if you are just looking for a decent movie: Never mind. Otherwise
enjoy the last 30 minutes of entertainment, but just don't forget about
the first 2 hours. It teaches you, what keeps our souls moving, when
there's nothing left to move our bodies.

With its portrayal of life spend in nature, the shifts between intense
action and often tedious but necessary patient waiting and work, "The
Revenant" was rumored to be an unforgettable film centered on Leonard
DiCaprio's performance and it delivered. "The Revenant" is directed by
Mexico-born Alejandro González Iñárritu, an award-winning writer,
director and producer born, an artist known for works highlighting the
complexity of human motivations and needs. Self-described as music more
often influencing for his work than other films, one easily discerned
this in his latest offering for it was like watching a movie equivalent
of a symphony: slow movements, a rising crescendo, and at last a finalé
and resolution.There have been survival dramas in the past, and the closest equivalent
I can think of is "Jeremiah Johnson" (1972), whose titular character
was played by Robert Redford. A similar theme of vengeance against
those who wronged and murdered his adopted native family is central, as
well as the poignant ending. DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass was left
to die after a bear attack, though mostly because his former comrades
rationalize this eventuality is best to save themselves from
threatening natives. Thomas Hardy's character, John Fitzgerald, is most
outspoken to abandon Glass along with a half native son, whose people
and all natives John deeply hates. However, he volunteers to stay
behind to witness Glass' passing, but as soon as the others leave his
rancor is made evident to both Glass and his son.Unlike most movies in the past, whether it was entirely absent or
confusingly presented, "The Revenant" includes a European character who
identifies with or lived in the "native" world, and Glass' visions of
his deceased native wife strengthens his resolve to find his murderous
betrayer despite life-threatening injuries. That special connection
keeps him going, but it also keeps him from losing himself in mindless
hatred and ultimately useless revenge. This quest is the central theme,
and his journey through beautiful but treacherous for the unwise and
unskilled landscapes provide some of the most "catch your breath"
scenes in recent film.I felt the material, pacing and progression was seamless for the type
of story although some critics and viewers have remarked negatively,
confused and distracted by Glass' "flashbacks" or "mystic reveries" of
the past. Without need for dialogue or description, key details and
events showcase the ugly truths of European invasion and colonization
of North America and the brutalization of its peoples whose negative
after-effects continue to this very day.Although DiCaprio is far and away the central star with a powerful
performance in which viewers can immerse themselves, Hardy's supporting
performance is so strong you utterly believe him as the despicable
coward and cold-blooded killer John Fitzgerald. Domhnall Gleeson is
also entirely believable as young Captain Henry, the pragmatic leader
of the original fur gathering expedition, who later tries to bring
Fitzgerald to justice.The title, "The Revenant" is apt, suggestively setting the mood and
demonstrating the story by description: "a person who returns,
especially and supposedly from the dead" yet that doesn't describe just
DiCaprio's character alone. What seems a simple, direct story based on
true events has been given multi-layers of meaning for those willing to
look beyond the surface or pay open-minded attention throughout its
near three hour runtime. 9/10

I personally found the film, like it says in the summary, simple.
Anyone who's seen the trailer or read the plot of the film will get
exactly just that -- a film about survival. It's survival to its core,
and I've personally never seen a film that captures this more
realistically. It's real, it's brutal, and in some cases, just
downright frightening. The use of natural lighting does not disappoint,
and it really is a beautifully shot film. I found myself captivated by
every scene, and the actors (especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom
Hardy) did a wonderful job of portraying their characters.But besides all that, the film really is simple, all terms aside. There
really isn't much of another story going besides the one mentioned in
the plot, and the side story that is there isn't as interesting as the
main conflict of the film. The scenes that lead up to the main
character's quest for survival is emotional and interesting in itself,
and although there were bits and pieces of it mentioned throughout the
rest of the film, I personally found that it didn't play much of a part
as the essence of the film or main character's motivation as it could
(or should) have.I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the art of
cinematography as I do, but anyone who's looking for an incredibly
complex film with layers of stories such as Inception (also starring
Leonardo DiCaprio), you might find yourself disappointed.

And when you think that America has no other problems, they actually
produce such a violence-glorifying, gory and disgusting film and
promote it as a good, 12 Oscars deserving production. Should get 12
Raspberries instead. . Worst motion picture ever produced . Worst performance Worst English
actor with unintelligible accent uttering . Worst script . Worst
directing . Worst everything (I can't even be bothered to look up what
the nominations are for)I wonder who slept with whom and how often to get all these Oscar
nominations. From start to finish there is no intelligent plot whatsoever. It is the
same old "You did me wrong and I will get my revenge" theme. That
little bit stunning nature they let you see is not making up for the
utter ugliness of this film. DiCaprio robbing through the woods,
bleeding, moaning and groaning, surviving in situations that not even
Superman would survive. Seriously - that is all Hollywood can do?The only one deserving of an Oscar would have been the bear, if he
would just have finished off Hugh Glass within the first 30 min of the
film and would therefore reduced my suffering by 120 min.P.S. Charlotte Rampling, I think you got it all wrong, I bet there are
at least 20 black actors (in maybe mediocre productions) who would have
been more deserving of a nomination (and winning).

This is worth watching just to get a taste of what early settlers faced
and how hard it was to earn a living sometimes at the cost of your own
life too. No excuses are allowed for anyone that chooses to live off
the land and take their chances. This is understood by those who do it.
We get to see how being injured in the wild is not good. The weather
never lets up and if you cannot hunt, you slowly starve to death. Its
harsh to say the least. The rewards are there too. Collecting monies
for doing this allows one to move up in the world to something better
although risky and no guarantees because getting in and doing the work
is one thing, getting out to collect is another. The local Indians just
go nuts when they see a white man. Then, the competition is fierce as
well. The laws that exist in civilization don't apply out there but men
still use it as a guide on how far they are willing to go with each
other. I thought that came in loud and clear. The star of the movie put
in some good work but I don't see it as outstanding or Oscar worthy but
what do I know? Politics and money may say different. Worth seeing but
only once. Big screen does it justice but cable will do as well. No
cold drinks during this movie as just watching it makes one cold. Good
snack and popcorn for the taste not the tenseness. Enjoy...

I found this movie too long and gross. Don't get me wrong, I love gory
and violent movies (I'm a Tarantino lover so... ) but I found The
Revenant irritating. The gore in this movie was just plain annoying and
over played, especially when he was being mauled by the bear. Jeez. I
found this movie a tad boring, almost turned off after the first
30mins. I only finished watching it (and gave it a 7/10) because of my
loyalty to Di' Caprio (He's Legendary). The story line was so cliché.
Man who has lost everything goes to seek vengeance, defying all odds
cause he has nothing to lose, then he finally meets his nemesis and
they have the last fight where he obviously wins after much struggle.
Tch.I felt the director was trying too hard to be heartless, killing off
some particular characters. On the bright side, great cinematography
and Leonardo. ❤️what How has he never won an Oscar? That's just cruel.
Tom Hardy was another wonder, legendary performance I must say.

It's that refreshingly wholistic approach (which some viewers might
perceive as nihilism on the director's part) that I found to be the
film's biggest accomplishment: it depicts the people in this story as
just another species trying to survive in that perilous frontier-world.
The emphasis is not really on the moral aspects of the brutal injustice
that the main character suffers or how the Native Americans are cruelly
exploited; we witness all that - but Iñarritu keeps a certain emotional
distance, as if he were shooting a documentary about predatory
wildlife. And just like the bear's attack, most of the violence in this
film comes as a reaction of defense. Be it self- defense, defending
one's offspring or defending territory and valuable resources. Even the
character that comes closest to an actual villain is driven by fear -
not hate, and his most obvious character defects were caused by a very
traumatizing experience. As in nature, there is a simple (if often
brutal) logic to why most characters, men or beasts, act the way they
do in 'The Revenant' (OK, maybe not the French - but I didn't say the
film was perfect, did I). And the bear attack was the most realistic
depiction of an animal attack I have ever seen on film.

**Three Golden Globe Awards for The Revenant.** Congratulations to
Inarritu for his two Golden Globe awards for the Revenant, he took home
"Best Motion Picture  Drama" and "Best Director", while Leonardo
DiCaprio won "Best Actor in a Motion Picture  Drama" The Oscar's are
next Leo, go get it!I'm not going to state the synopsis or any details about this film as
there are probably countless reviews on IMDb and so forth!I'd like to start off by saying when i first seen this film's trailer,
i already knew it was going to be an EPIC adventure of a film
regardless if it is a remake, and a great remake it was! Outstanding director Alejandro González Iñárritu's film "the Revenant"
is leaps and bounds better than the original film "the man in the
wilderness"! This film not only exceeds in executing a savage and wild
story but does it with such an artsy an breathtaking style!The landscape and visuals are top notch work, not to mention they
filmed this with pretty much no set and with all natural lighting
during freezing conditions! That right there is an accomplishment in
itself, and they nailed it superbly! Big props to cinematographer
Emmanuel Lubezki for such great camera work! More on that in a bit!Leonardo DiCaprio as always delivers a great performance and makes you
feel as if you're in his shoes going through all that chaos and cruelty
people in the 1800's would have gone through, not to mention the
UN-merciful wilderness!Tom Hardy was equally exceptional acting as a villain! You could feel
the savageness through his performance! Hair raising emotions on his
part!The key factor in this film was also the great visual eye of
Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who like i stated used only natural
lighting and did superb "long-shots" with no cut-scenes which knocked
you right off of your feet! The intro of the film got me so hyped!
Being a photographer and a somewhat inspired short video hobbyist, i
could only dream of being as great as Mr. Lubezki! Such a great
inspiration to us amateurs!Out of this world directing from Inarritu! Breathtaking cinematics by Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki!Superb acting performance by DiCaprio and of course Tom Hardy, not to
mention Domhnall Gleeson who did an amazing job as well!This is the type of film you must see in the theaters, the experience
is just heart pounding and exciting!I can't wait for this to come out on Blu-ray! I will definitely be the
first to grab me a copy!-Scott S.

After the Revenant breathes it's last icy cold breaths of a long and
unrelentingly fierce runtime, there is almost assured chances that you
as a witness to the events laid before you on the screen so frequently
beautifully yet so uncompromising will be in need of a quick and needed
respite from partaking in Alejandro González Iñárritu's intense and
breathtaking tale of revenge and the will to survive.Without question one of the harshest big screen blockbusters that has
ever graced our screens, the Revenant more than likely came out the way
it has thanks to Iñárritu's huge success with last years much loved
Birdman, and if Birdman's reception did indeed secure the Revenant's
huge budget and also secure Iñárritu the chance to create his movie the
way he so invisioned, then we as cinema lovers should be thanking our
lucky stars.Working on the largest scale yet seen in his career, Iñárritu alongside
his willing cast and crew and in particular trusted D.O.P Emmanuel
Lubezki (who has his third straight Oscar in the bag after this
effort), create an almost fever dream of a movie that fills it's every
frame with stark beauty or jaw dropping feats of filmmaking skill that
burst out of the blocks with a white knuckle opening stanza and are no
better showcased than in a scarily in your face bear attack.
Highlighting these moments in the film however are quite arbetory as
the Revenant is filled with moments that will last long in the memory
and feature a Leonardo DiCaprio performance that will likely see the
great modern day actor finally secure that long overdue Best Actor
Oscar.Giving all new meaning to a bad day at the office, poor old
frontiersman Hugh Glass is having an incredibly unfortunate run of bad
luck that sees him not only become a grizzly's plaything but a near
dead man that just seems to keep on copping it from nature and from
mankind. It's not a performance that requires DiCaprio to chew on
dialouge as his role here is literally 5  10 mins of talking but it's
a role that sees the renowned actor dive head first into a physically
demanding and full bodied turn.From his central battle with a grizzly, cosy nights with his horse
friend and yummy buffalo dinners just to name a few, DiCaprio becomes
Hugh Glass and while it's arguable that this is in fact his "best" ever
performance, in a field that pales in comparison, DiCaprio seems the
front runner at the soon to be held Oscars. While DiCaprio is the clear
standout, he is ably supported by another rough and mumbling Tom Hardy
turn as the films villain Fitzgerald and the increasingly impressive
Domhnall Gleeson as good hearted army man Captain Andrew Henry.Whilst it would be easy to go on at length concerning the Revenant's
many highlights and successes the film does fall ever so short in a
couple of matters that stop it from becoming a genuine fully fledged
immaculate motion picture.There's a sufficient lack at times of emotional engagement to the
characters and events in the film and the picture as a whole could've
done with a sharper edit as there are times when scenes play out too
long or events become blurred in a myriad procession of bad luck after
bad luck but overall these are slight and insignificant criticisms when
held up to the films wins and Iñárritu and his crew should be highly
commended for crafting a film that utilises nature and realism like
many films could only but dream of.A film that deserves to be seen on the largest screen available to your
viewing needs, the Revenant is a western like none other and a big
budgeted film that walks entirely to its own beat. Most often jaw
droppingly filmed, violently intense, impeccably staged and featuring
an award worthy turn from DiCaprio, the Revenant is must watch material
that even though we may only be a few weeks into 2016, we already have
a front runner for film of the year.4 1/2 prolonged bear maulings out of 5

OK, so first of all, I have way too much to say about this movie. It's
intense as all get out. Visually striking, the camera work was great.
As Leo took a slice to the cheek from fellow cast mate Tom Hardy, blood
smeared the camera lens giving it authentic brutality for us as
viewers. The sound was so crisp, my own ears were ringing after the
arrows released from the bows of the Indians effortlessly whistled by
and hit a nearby tree trunk 5 minutes before! This was truly a visual
film for me. The color palette was so rich, I honestly can't remember
the last time I saw a movie that was filled with such vibrancy! It's
gross but I could literally smell the sweat coming from everyone in the
theater because of the intensity this film brought. I could taste the
dryness in my mouth after my heart sank several times during the
emotional gut-wrenching heartbreaks. So, I think its safe to say, my 5
senses were definitely utilized to the fullest extent! Haha! But back
to visuals, I loved how Alejandro González Iñárritu (Director of
Revenant) created moments in the film to give the audience time to
absorb all of the epic potency that were birthed in the scenes before.
For example, a battle between former allies now turned foes comes to a
close in a 30 second scene that focuses on the still waters of a ravine
to reflect on what just happened and how the currents are always
changing. Just like in life too. Or the loss of a loved one ending in a
scene gliding through the dark skies with a faint glowing light
breaking through the clouds to suggest that that loved one is now truly
home safe and sound. But the dark skies don't make the pain any easier.
The symbolism and metaphorical allusions had my heart and mind racing
which made this film even more enjoyable. To top it all off, Ryuichi
Nakamoto, responsible for composing the musical score was absolutely
phenomenal. I'm a music guy so this was definitely the icing on the
cake for me. All in all, fantastic movie. With intensity aside though,
the film did offer some lighthearted moments as well to go along with
the excellent structure that Iñárritu already had going for its mint
condition exoskeleton of a movie! I don't usually do long, drawn-out
movie reviews for just any movie but this one was worth it. Although,
It's definitely not for the faint of heart as my cousin and I were
outmatched in age by at least 20 or 30 years ha ha! I see this film
winning many awards or at least being nominated for a some!
Now........... for crying out loud, will someone please give Leo his
Oscar already! Hahaha!

Holy Smokes. I just finished watching this captivating movie a little
while ago and it was Absolutely Phenomenal. I will start with the story
which is about the explorer named Hugh Glass who is left for dead by a
friend after a brutal bear attack in the American Frontier of 1823. The
story is extremely solid especially since it's based on a true story. I
did find the story dragging a few times but it doesn't take off of the
score. I will now move onto the acting which was Breathtaking with both
Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio playing their roles to Perfection like
in every movie they have ever done prior. I must say that the two of
them together make for one Hell of a powerful movie experience. The
other actors played their roles just as well even though they were
minor in comparison. I will now move onto the action which was if I
dare say the most Savage and Barbarous Adaptation of combat during that
time period which took place on the American Frontier of the 1800's. I
mean it was Masterfully shot and truly one of a kind even to present
day Military movies. The military movies of today pale in comparison to
just how Ruthless it was back then for the men who fought. I will now
move onto the Cinematography which was done by Emmanuel Lubezki which
is a Master of his Arts. I mean they shot the film in both Canada and
Argentina and a small part in America but the dedication it takes to
travel all the way to South America for snow just to double as the
American Frontier says volumes on how dedicated the cast and crew were
on this film. I can't stress enough how visually stunning the shots
were and how realistic it all felt and the music was on point even
though it was sparse it was still Amazing. I will close with this
statement and that is that you must go and watch this film. I mean it's
one of the Best Films and the most refreshingly original films in terms
of the cinematography and the depth of the characters will power to
evoke just how Indomitable the human body and the human spirit can be
when it wants something bad enough.

Like many, I walked into the theater expecting a great film; somehow I
got more. The film from start to finish was beautiful, every shot could
be framed and put in to an art gallery. However, if the film was only a
spectacle for the eyes, then it is no more than the newest Transformer
film. Thus, obviously, the film was more. Although the plot was simple,
a man left for dead who seeks revenge on those who are responsible,
there is no moment in the movie where you will be bored. The audience
remains hooked and continuously roots for Hugh Glass (the protagonist
of the film) even as the odds of his survival become slimmer every
second. This is due to the captivating soundtrack, spectacular
cinematography, and of course stellar acting performances. Leonardo
DeCaprio's performance, although one with very little dialogue, is
mesmerizing. DeCaprio did not need to say any words, in fact, if he had
it could have made his performance silly by overacting. Instead,
DeCaprio is able to express his emotions with his physical performance.
Tom Hardy and Domhnall Gleeson also gave fantastic performances. Hardy
taking a role that was outside his comfort zone, the antagonist, and
somehow manages to own it. Another name that needs to be mentioned is
Alejandro González Iñárritu, who yet again delivers a film ahead of
it's time. If the Oscars go as they should, this should be that film
that pisses off all the other films because it is hogging all of the
Oscars.

At a glimpse, The Revenant seems like a movie you would reluctantly sit
and spend more than 150 minutes on if you are not into that kind of
adventure-drama you get to see from the vague sequences of the trailer.
Nevertheless, once you start watching the very first minutes, you are
there, almost transfixed by the lifelike dynamic of events taking place
at a good pace, captivated by the actors' brilliant performance and
their tenacious struggle for survival, the violent encounters, the
sufferings, the awe-inspiring natural and wild landscapes. DiCaprio gives an outstanding performance as the movie leading
character Hugh Glass. Tom Hardy compliments the cast as his tough
antagonist, the manipulative and fugitive John Fitzgerald. More than
anything else, the movie focuses on the love for life, deep-rooted into
men's psyches, deeper than their fears. Nature's powers above man's
will, is another force that drives the movie events. Inspiring is the
well depicted audacity of the men involved in their quests, both the
protagonists and the local Indians. There is a fine line between
loyalty and betrayal. You get to see individuals haunted by their past,
determined for their future goals. In nowadays more and more
emasculated urban society, through this movie, you get a nice cold
breeze of early 19th century struggle for life, manhood and
never-ending efforts for survival. The camera smoothly shifts between wide angle landscapes and close- up
focusing on actions which offers an absolutely rewarding experience.
The director aimed at natural lighting which adds to the authenticity
of what you see. The camera proximity to the object or characters along
the movie offers stunning captions of brutal confrontations between
men, the man and the animal as well as characters' facial expressions
that reveal inner battles when no word is spoken. I saw the movie on a
PC screen, no doubt the visual satisfaction is doubled on a theater
screen. The soundtrack is like the flashing light of a lighthouse: unexpected,
dramatic, keeping on its own rhythm, yet adding for better to the
overall drama of the movie. It reminds of brief sequences of the chords
of Tchaikovsky's last symphony final movement: there is a long void and
then similar sharp tragic notes of strings. Nine months of filming in remote wild environment, natural light, very
good cast and few CGI have produced an exceptionally good film. This is
an epic masterpiece and a real achievement of cinematography.

I am writing this after just getting out of watching this movie for the
first time, but this movie is about as close to perfect as I can
perceive. As my title says, this movie portrays Leo's characters pain,
despair, revenge, and justice better than anything ever. I went into this movie with high expectations. i had heard from friends
that this could be Leo's chance to finally win an Oscar, and being an
avid fan of his, this excited me. But realistically, this could be
nominated and win every category that it can. The entire story was
seamless. For me, after watching it only once, I didn't see any plot
holes, I was entranced from beginning to end, and the ending left me
speechless. Needless to say, I was absolutely blown away.Tom Hardy, while only a supporting role, and very much the antagonist
of this story, was incredible. He portrayed his character beautifully,
showing the hate for the Native Americans so vividly, but also showing
the side of him that made you understand that he did everything because
he believed it to be the right thing to do. His character was eerily
funny, making me laugh at times where I felt terrible for laughing (but
that could just be the twisted side of me). Leo, on the other hand, was just as great, obviously playing the
protagonist. He displayed the pain that his character felt perfectly
(although a lot of that credit has to go to the director). In his eyes,
in every shot, you could see the drive for his character to find
justice. He showed the fear he had to overcome after the bear attack
that was displayed in the trailer. While he said very few actual words
the entire film, each seemed to rock me to the core. His struggle to
find revenge for the people he loved was so pure and real, I'm truly
baffled by the how beautifully he portrayed his character.Finally, my favorite part of this movie was that it displayed the life
of the settlers of the west unbelievably well. It showed how difficult
life was, the vast difficulties that the settlers had with the natives
(warranted or not), the struggles that every person living there had
with money, cold, food, and generally trying to survive. And to top it
all off, it was set in an incredible part of the US, in (in my opinion)
the most beautiful time of the year there. While sitting there feeling
horrible for the various characters, I sat there marveling at the
beauty of the land around them, appreciating the all too infrequent
looks back into the past. All in all, Alejandro G. Iñárritu has created another masterpiece. I
would highly recommend any person who truly loves movies to go and see
it for yourself. Fare warning, it was bloody, gruesome, and full of
swearing, but it is also perfectly placed in order to make the movie so
much better. I loved this movie, will be buying it when it comes out on
DVD, and will watch the Oscars that much more anxiously because I truly
believe this could be Leo's time to finally win an Oscar (along with
probably 6 or 7 more for the rest of the movie and cast). While saying
something is a 10 out of 10 is difficult, this movie has earned it. Pay
the 10 bucks and see it in theaters while you can. ENJOY!!

Another great film from Alejandro González Iñárritu who is clearly an
outstanding director. Beginning with his early "Amores perros", his
films are always make you think about some paramount life laws. This film is a veracious Western with a tale of revenge. It describes a
story of Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio), an American frontiersman, fur
trapper and explorer, miraculously survived after the attack of grizzly
bear and left for dead by his fellows. From the first frames, this
movie gets you into what is happening like a rough river Missouri in
which neighborhood the main events of the film were placed. Overcoming
incredible obstacles, he gets over great distance almost crawling in
order to avenge John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) for the murder of his son.
In its entirety, this film is rather weakly filled with emotions. But
in general, various incidents and scenes, characters and symbols, all
of this is quite clearly creates the atmosphere of resistance and
desire to live. Apparently, visuals are playing the most important role
in this creation. Perhaps the best operator of modernity Emmanuel
Lubezki completely immerses you in an atmosphere of wild nature. The
camera clouds up, gets wet, covered with frost or blood, together with
the main characters. It really blurs the border between subject and
object. In point of fact, the visual structure of "The Revenant" uses
all the tricks Iñárritu used earlier in "Birdman" - the narrative is
interspersed by flashbacks, dreams, hallucinations, the character meets
the ghosts of the past to help him see the way, and so on. And it does
serves its purpose. Separately want to mention successfully used
Kubrick-style symbols, including biblical. For instance, there is a
small link in the film, when antagonist said that all the will of God.
After half of the film protagonist answered him, that revenge in God's
hands. This bunch is seems to be very important in this film since it
reveals its central idea. In sum, the film turned out to be quite strong and tough. Of course, it
will go down in history as one of the most powerful films. It is
necessary to watch the film exclusively at the movie theater, all the
basic capacity is concentrated on the visual aspect. 8/10.

When I read about this movie I was pretty excited and when I read that
Leonardo Di Caprio was in it I was even more excited but then I red
that Innaratu was directing and that took some joy away from me. I mean
we all know that his last movie 'Birdman' was rather a disappointment
and I didn't really get why he got the Oscar for that. However, in this
movie he makes up for everything he did wrong in Birdman. With many
mind-blowing shots of some amazing landscapes and many really great
camera angles this movie will blow everyones mind that knows to
appreciate the little details of movie making. Innaratu really
convinced me that he deserved an Oscar with this movie. Leonardo
DiCaprio is at his best here. He already delivered a mind blowing
performance in his last picture but this one was even better. Without
many words and very little dialogue for his character DiCaprio manages
to take the viewer on an adventure. The way he binds the audience to
the screen with just his body acting and all the emotions he portrays
only with his face throughout the movie is unbelievable. Together with
the great camera work and the great performances of both DiCaprio and
Tom Hardy this movie is just a masterpiece. Everything fits together,
the music, with the shots and the situation and the whole storyline. In my opinion many viewers who do not appreciate the little details of
movie making and especially know to appreciate things like camera work
and music and cinematography and all those things will be bored by this
movie, but when we take all this into account this movie is a
masterpiece.I hope it will be enough this time for Leonardo DiCaprio to win an
Oscar because all the other movies that might be nominated don't have a
main character that is portrayed this convincingly.

I must say I had a bit of a biased (positive) feel to this movie prior
to even seeing it. Leo and Tom are 2 of my favorite actors and they
haven't failed in their previous performances to say the least.Getting on with the movie, the film throws you into the cold, dark
wilderness of Canada. The captivating performance by Leo and the way
the film was shot in low, natural light went hand in hand to really
plunge your senses in this eerie and dangerous environment. I almost
felt freezing cold on certain occasions because I was so immersed in
the film.There were very minor let-downs in the movie such as the ease at how
Leo ignited fires all the time despite blizzards, wind and him being
soaked in cold water.Other than that, a great movie and well-worth watching

Strong stuff this is. Blood and snow. Red and white, warm and freezing
life-vital element of water. Speaking of which, this is an "elemental"
movie. Aside of water, there is air, smoke, stone, steel and (finally)
fire! One that burns from wood but also one that flames out of a gun
barrel. You can almost smell it during the movie. It is actually full
of elemental/transcendental (in our day-to-day reality taken for
granted) anti-valuables of survival. Such strength shown by the the
characters (shining acting), almost transcends to the viewer too!
Cruelty of human species may not sound new nor distant. But this time,
sitting comfortably before a screen, you better get prepared for the
row, harsh, sticky-freezing and sharpened blade of reality as it gets!
And as it might get to us all in the moment where there is no place for
warmth of humanity, fellow man support, comfort and altruism whatever
meaning it could bear in circumstances of authentic rough unforgiving
nature itself; but also the nature of man himself (and yes: the real
wilderness it is both ways!) Mr. Hardy performs negative role best I
ever sow him do, as opposed to Di Caprio's betrayed and tortured-soul
character. As the story unveils, hard game of cruel survival sucks the
viewer in. Almost sublime music follows the mostly nonverbal but deeply
atmospheric narration. Being depict are rudimentary drives of a
stripped human being: food, family... Survival (driven by the strength
of revenge) in fog of pain and fear. At moments, it seems there is no
end to the suffering. And there isn't...

Fantastic movie! I really loved almost everything about it. Leonardo
DiCaprio played out his role really well and it wouldn't surprise me if
he finally gets his Oscar he deserves. He was telling so much with so
few words. Also credits to the make-up artist who did an incredible job
on his wounds. Tom Hardy did a fantastic acting job as well. Props too
both of the guys! I really loved the beautiful shots of the nature and
most of all the scene with the bear. My first thought when seeing the
bear was; "oh, this is gonna look bad." But it sure didn't! The bear
attack was so realistic, it really blew my mind. You can argue the plot
was a bit predictable, but because of the great acting and the
beautiful shots it didn't bother me at all. Great movie, Oscar worthy!

I was looking forward to this film and the beginning is good and the
grizzly bear scene is very impressive but thereafter it falls away
somewhat. Leonardo dicaprio seems to survive above all logic - bear
attack, nearly dead and frothing from the mouth, bit then can crawl,
icy river in a animal skins and then appears to make an almost instant
recovery and can then walk again, neatly guts a horse in a blizzard and
sleeps in it to keep warm, despite the fact that he's slept out for the
previous nights with massive ice crystals in his beard and survived. He
then looks quite well but collapses when his employer finds him and
then a short time later is fit and fine to pursue the baddie. On
another point all the musket shots are amazingly accurate but almost
everyone forgets to reload them so there are a lot of surprised clicks
and no shot (if you owned and understood a musket wouldn't you reload
immediately you'd fired it?). Then there is end where leonardo pursues
the baddie and watches him fall in a heap at the bottom of as slope.
What shall we do? The logical thing is to reload the musket and take a
shot at presumably a dead cert range, given how accurate they have
been, but no we fall down the slope in a sloppy manner( maybe the bear
bites and tree fall injuries are kicking in at last) and then ensures
fight where no weapon is reused. The baddie avoids a tomahawk strike
but gets stabbed in the back of the knee but leonardo abandons the
seemingly effective and we have the classic strangulation scene before
finally the baddie is thrown in the river to the delight of the
Indians. I had hoped to enjoy this movie and had previously watched the
hateful eight which was fun but a bit overlong (fast forward the first
45mins) but I have to say that quentin Tarantinos film was much better.
Okay it's different take but still a western

The movie is worthy. The North American locations let the spectator
feel the chill of the winter. The photography is remarkable, and the
camera is dirty and steamy when it comes close to the characters face,
to emphasize their agony. A Leonardo Di Caprio that gives us a good
example of Stanislavskij school. The plot is very simple. The main
protagonist is forsaken by his mates under an inch of soil, torn apart
by a grizzly. He snakes and limps to reach his camp and get his revenge
for his son murder. Leo's interpretation and the direction, with long
sequences shots, let the spectator taste the multiple fighting and
chasing scenes. A must seen movie that I hope can finally bring an
Oscar to Di Caprio, thinking about the countless efforts that he did to
show us a dirty, wounded, feverish, vengeful character.

cinematographer at their very best,THIS IS AN UNBIASED REVIEW*I had been waiting for this movie since long because of the big names
it carried and boy was I impressed! Hugh Glass, the American
frontiersman played by Leonardo, is left to dead by his men after being
badly injured in a deadly combat with a bear in the wild, in perhaps
the most amazing scene of the movie. What follows is an excruciating
(in real) and amazing (in reel) journey of survival in the most
gruesome conditions. The Revenant rides off to a brilliant start with
the first few minutes already setting up the mood for the tale to be
followed. But, hold on, this isn't just another "Cast Away". Inarritu
gave a blend of humane touch with spirituality to it and made the movie
appealing and poignant. Glass's character is developed as he makes his
way battling against death. Glass does it all. Fighting against a wild
bear, healing himself in the weirdest places, sleeping inside an animal
carcass and many other things. Leonardo gave another 'Oscar-worthy'
performance and chances are high that this could be it. Tom Hardy,
however, is the surprise package of the movie. Had I not known before
that Tom Hardy is acting in this movie, I'd have totally failed to
recognize him. (Give the poor soul a movie where he can carry a normal
look!) He has given an equally powerful performance as Leo's and
develops as a great antagonist with his crispy accent. There are some
very powerful scenes in the movies that you can expect from any movie
which has Lubezki as its cinematographer. He's the master of his skill
and perfectly shoots every scene. The art of cinematography and camera
work is yet to be learnt from him by many on how to develop the best
intensity in a shot. Lubezki uses lenses to capture the gruesome cold
almost as if you could feel Glass's struggle to catch his breath and
the 'longers' to develop the intensity of the combats. The usual
metaphorical elements that Inarritu is expert at, and the fantastic
acting that the leads have done, add to the brilliance of every scene.
The movie carries on with a slow pace, just like you'd expect from a
survival tale. It has its ups and downs. Some pretty intense scene and
some scenes where one might catch a yawn or two but Inarritu makes sure
the same tone is maintained throughout. Inarritu has given his usual
strokes in between embellishing the script even further. To be honest,
this could have just been an average movie had Inarritu not directed
it. The visually stunning cinematography and the great performances are
its backbones and they support the movie throughout. It's a great
adaptation of the novel but more than that, the movie carries on its
own due to the amazing teamwork by each and every unit of the movie.

Would like to write a lot about this movie but I wanna keep it short ,
since we already have long reviews.Just gonna say that this movie is a masterpiece of directing and acting
, A.G.Inarritu delivers as usual with his unique and original style of
directing.Besides that , DiCaprio's performance/acting was top notch(HE MIGHT
FINALLY WIN THE Oscar WITH THIS) , same goes for Tom Hardy(I'm happy he
took the role after reading the script) and the other minor actors.Really good and intense film which keeps you tied to the seat for a
good 2 hours and 30 minutes~ , for me and many others as I seen here in
the comments , it's one of the best movies of 2015/2016 , if not one of
the best in the last decade.Enjoyed a lot , 9/10.

Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hugh Glass, a fur trapper, who in the 1820s,
was part of a fur trapping expedition, who was attacked by a grizzly
bear and left for dead by his companions. His major rival, John
Fitzgerald, portrayed by the great British actor Tom Hardy, using a
dead on Texas accent, make The Revenant one of the best films of 2015.
The scenery is awesome and the story a compelling one. My only
criticism is that at over two and a half hours, it is a little too
long. The director, Alejandro Inarritu, could have tightened up the
editing a bit and still had an excellent movie. Even so, The Revenant
is worth watching.

While not my type of film, there's no mistaking it; The Revenant is one
outstandingly made film. From cinematography, story, acting, scoreit's
probably destined to win best picture. While not my favorite movie of the year, again, not my brand of cinema
and the movie never seemed to end, I wouldn't have a problem with it
taking home the gold. Maybe Leo can FINALLY win one, as well. As good
as he's been in the past, if he didn't give his all here, I don't know
what it'll take.While the story begins confusing  very little is spelled out, it
becomes fairly simple. In probably thee most realistic animal attacks
I've seen, the 1800's Cap'n Glass wrestles with a bear and is
eventually left for dead by his men. When the even worse circumstance
happens, it's man vs. nature leading into man vs. man.The Revenant isn't a movie I ever want to see again, but I can
appreciate all the efforts, scope, heart and depth that went into this
production. It's an unmistakably realistic Western if I've ever seen
one.Not for kids and not for the mainstream, it's still recommended for
cinema and (real) Old West lovers.

I really enjoyed this movie. And any fan of the older westerns like
Jeremiah Johnson will probably also like it. With the cinemas filled
with CGI jammed movies with very little story, this movie was really
refreshing. The one CGI obvious effect was the bear attack. Don't get
me wrong, it was pretty good. And there was no way to do that scene any
other way. The acting was pretty good, but as most of the movie Leo
crawling and grunting, there is only so much to go by. But I think Leo
should get an Oscar just for his performance in such insanely nasty
conditions. This movie isn't filmed in some back lot. It was filmed in the winter
in Canada and Argentina. Which brings me to the filmography, probably
the best seen in a long time. You can tell that they took great care to
use only natural lighting. The lighting and camera work was beautiful.
You can feel the dread and cold and dreary weather. Which I read led to
a lot of delays, but I think it was well worth it. The writing was pretty good. I think if they kept parts of the movie
closer to the original tale, it would of made for a better movie. Now I
know Glass probably exaggerated on his original telling. It had some
parts, such as he avoided gangrene by tearing open a rotten log and
allowing the maggots to eat the dead flesh. But overall the script
wasn't to unbelievable. But.....****Spoilers below****** There are some parts that just have you going
"Oh, come on!". My biggest one, was the scene in the river. Anyone that
is remotely familiar with water survival knows you have a few minutes
before you pass out and die. And that's under ideal conditions. We
don't know how long he was in there, but it was clearly a long time.
Yes Glass did go down the river, but he had built a crude raft. Fixing
a hole in your throat with gunpowder. I know this is an old western
trick to cauterize a wound. But surely it would of simply sealed the
hole open and not closed the hole. My big surprise was after seeing the movie and doing research about the
real Glass. Is that the ending is nearly completely false. Not gonna
spoil that one, but let's just say it would of been a boring ending.Overall a pretty good movie. Mostly believable. Beautifully filmed.
Nicely acted. And Leo earned my respect for performing in such
conditions.

The Revenant was without a doubt a completely fleshed out ride from
start to finish. It was one seemingly hopeless trial after another for
Glass and the viewer had to helplessly sit and watch, hoping and
praying that nothing else would go wrong(though something always did).
In my opinion the camera work set a very specific and fitting tone,
giving the feeling of being more of an onlooker who was right there
with the characters, rather than the choppy editing styles that seem to
be becoming more popular these days. The viewer was treated to
continuous shots that didn't feel too long or drawn out, and did
exactly what they were supposed to do. By the end of the film you
absolutely abhorred Fitzgerald which is a massive credit to the
performance of Tom Hardy, felt real sympathy for Bridges and just
wanted Glass to get out alive! There was so much good in this movie, I
think it may be more interesting to point out some of the few things
that I have minor issues with. Firstly, in the (absolutely fantastic)
sequence with the bear. This scene was magnificent, the bear looked
wonderful and DiCaprio really did look like he was being mauled by a
wild animal. The only thing that bothered me was that after the bear
believed it had killed Glass, it stood on his head. There is no reason
for the bear to take any of its full body weight off of Glass's head.
I'm not an expert but I imagine that 270Kg (googled average grizzly
weight) is more than enough to crush anyone's skull. Secondly, and
finally, there is a scene where Glass is facing the camera and his
breath fogs up the lens before he passes out. While this led to a nice
transition into another shot, it did not really follow any kid of
previous or upcoming interactions with the 4th wall. Again, this is
literally all I can "complain" about. Perhaps some movie goers may find
the pacing a bit hard to deal with if they aren't able to be engrossed
by the story like a lot of people seemingly were. Honestly If I had to
pick out the one thing that surprised me the most in the entire movie
though, through all the insane things that transpired throughout
Glass's journey, it was something very small towards the end. When
Glass swings his hatchet at Fitzgerald and just barely clips some of
his fingers off in the final fight, it made me reel more than any of
the other violence throughout the film. I believe this is because it
seemed so believable and comparatively mundane against the other
instances of combat. Overall The Revenant was a beautiful, bumpy ride.
personally I don't need to see it again, and that's not a bad thing. I
feel like I have gone through this ordeal with Glass and do not intend
to be put through it again. It was filled with gorgeous scenery,
amazing performances from the entire cast (great work by Will Poulter,
hope he keeps it up), and a captivating story, I would absolutely
recommend this film to anyone who can take it.

Some of the best cinema of the year, but it goes on for too long and
starts crumbling by the end. It's a simple revenge flick mixed with a
survivalist tale. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a frontiersman with a half
Indian son who has been hired to guide a group of trappers. After
suffering an attack by Indians, DiCaprio is mauled by a bear. Unable to
travel further, two men, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter, along with
DiCaprio's son, stay behind to care for him until he dies, as they
assume he will. Hardy doesn't really feel like it, though, so at the
first opportunity he murders the son, tells Poulter (who didn't witness
the murder) that the Indians are nearby, and buries DiCaprio in a
shallow grave, still alive. DiCaprio eventually digs his way out and
goes after Hardy to get his sweet, sweet revenge. The film is at its
best when its in its you-are-there, in-the-actors'-faces phase, making
you feel like part of the action. Its at its worst when it goes into
flashbacks and DiCaprio's highly symbolic dreams. The final act is
pretty silly, too. Domhnall Gleeson, who has really earned a vacation
at this point, also co-stars.

It hasn't been far already into 2016 and there's already a fantastic
film that captivates your mind, body and even spirit to break or even
open further; and that film to be labelled as a 'Top Film' is The
Revenant.I won't go into much of the film's plot but I'll keep it brief;
inspired around the famous Hugh Glass (who has been labelled as
history's toughest survivor) it tells his deep and yet engaging
adventure that see's him fighting not only for himself but his quest
for justice when he is left for dead by an emotionless, careless and
even cowardly member of his crew.What makes The Revenant so amazing is that it's directed by both award
winning and critically acclaimed filmmaker Alejandro G Inarritu with
his style of storytelling, themes and character that make the silver
screen shine. There is so much to take away and grip from this so I'll
try to give my best of it all without spoiling it for you; firstly the
film's themes include 'Survival of the human spirit', 'revenge' 'God
and spirituality' and they help to keep the audience not only intrigued
to the plot but the way the characters are seen from our eyes.
Importantly, with Leo's character (Hugh Glass) we are shown that he's
not only a tough human but he's battling his own demons that push him
to be as strong yet broken in his path for revenge. Leo has played many
great roles in his acting career but I think that this role is his best
and truly toughest to play, it's bound to get him award nominations
again as like other years but this is indeed something that the Oscars
should deeply consider for him to receive. Tom Hardy is fantastic as
well; his character is truly a monster that is emotionless, heartless
and really driven for the audience to despise.Cinematography was outstanding throughout and the locations where the
film takes place are 100% real and really captures the realism of the
story's setting from wet forests, raging rivers, snowy mountains and
isolated trails. So much detail and thought has been put into this and
the efforts from both the cast and the crew behind the camera make it
seem so believably strong. Sound mixing and editing is strong too, with
sounds of birds, winds and even breathing that makes it sound so
beautiful but it's is composed soundtrack that makes it seem so
emotional and yet captivating, from Glass's visions to even seeing him
survive the harsh environment make these worthy candidates for Oscars
and further awards in technical achievement in film. Again, we see
camera shots that seem a 'one shot take' and even in one sequence we
switch from one character to another. The violence is brutal, bloody
and well executed and it can be confronting for some.Overall, The Renevant is a breathtaking, captivating, and brutal but
beautifully shot film that has so much to grasp but it will take an
open mind to get it's themes and character development. This is indeed
on my list (and the first entry) of best films for 2016.5\5 - Nick

A beautiful film about everything but beauty.From the very moment that the film started I knew that I was going to
love it. A slow sweeping long take featuring beautiful scenery and the
calming flow of water soon interrupted by the interference of man.The opening battle sequence sounds like something that would be
described in something like a Star wars film, however this (and it is
a) battle sequence is one to take your breath away. A brutal depiction
of small scale war, the scene takes place in one shot weaving in and
out between bullets, arrows and death. Putting viewers in the middle of
the battlefield, creating personal conflict. There aren't really any
'sides' to this scene, all that's present is desperation and utter
unnecessary viciousness.The actors of the film all did stellar jobs on their performances, more
so than most in films I've ever seen in my life. I'm not one to
recognize great acting or even bad acting, usually I buy the actors
playing as their characters, but in this it was beyond that. I believed
that Hardy's Fitzgerald was the biggest scumbag on the face of the
earth and I felt the betrayal, desperation and will to survive through
DiCaprio's protagonist. Man did this movie make me hate Tom Hardy! But
most importantly I just have to mention the actor Domhnall Gleeson,
this guy is the definition of diversity. Most recently he played a
cartoonishly evil Star wars character in The Force Awakens, before that
I'd last seen him in Unbroken and earliest I'd seen him in About Time
as a charming romantic comedy lead. I look forward to seeing more of
this guy and literally don't know what to expect from him either.Beyond the actors however making it's appearances larger than life was
simply the setting. Beautiful shots all throughout the film, used as
not only establishing shots but interesting angles and shots for even
moments of dialogue and general conversation. The Revenant is a visual
marvel. From the unique look of the world we see through the film's
directors eyes to the astonishingly impressive long takes that I was in
love with. The film took what I loved about Birdman (The film making)
and added (What I thought Birdman was lacking) fantastic characters and
an interesting story which happened to revolve around revenge and
survival.Another thing about the world this film was set in was that it felt
full and real. Other people in the film had their own stories, their
own fights and motives that we saw glimpses of even though we
ultimately followed solely the protagonist. This made the movie feel
larger, like a real piece of history.And not to mention the sincere intensity that this movie holds
throughout its entire run time. (Which is saying something considering
it's just short of 3 hours.) The pure violence in this movie was
actually quite shocking, and that's saying something coming from
somebody who has watched some of the "Most disturbing films of all
time."Early on in the film is an in-famous scene featuring a bear, I won't
spoil anything beyond this scene but I will say that you can feel this
scene. You believe this scene. It holds you and it keeps going for
longer than comfortable and it's great. This isn't a movie you "Enjoy"
It's a movie that you experience and personally, a movie I fell in love
with almost instantly.The unique lighting style and the subtle sounds showing that the movie
wasn't afraid to use silence combine to make a realistic and fierce
portrayal of a look into a fictionalized past. It's a long one but I
feel like the pacing is perfect, I wasn't bored at all and there were
times where not much was actually happening but not once did I feel
like it was slow and dragging. This is one tough act to follow, and as
much as I'm looking forward to movies like Civil War and Deadpool, I
wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be my favourite movie of the
year. 10/10

So I've watched many many movies, probably over 150 alone last year
(2015). And this movie... made me speechless! The only things my mouth
could spit our were "What the F***?" and "Oh my God!" during some of
it's moments! (Caution Interstellar Spoiler: Skip to the next
paragraph) I was drawn deeper into this movie than Matthew McConaughey
into a black hole! (Yeah right? "What a bad pun!")I knew this film would be full of blood and probably gore but WOW! That
was intense! You know these moments when movies cut away from the gory
part? Well this movie didn't let out sh***! Game of Thrones seems like
Spongebob Squarepants next to this one! The best comparison for the
brutality in it I could think about is probably The Raid 2! Feel free
to tell me if you got another one (well yeah except movies like Saw)!
So if you still want to watch this movie make sure to prepare yourself
(if necessary) so you don't end up in the cinema, puking all over your
neighbor's front seat! If you like gore (like I do) then you will
probably love this film even more! Alejandro González Iñárritu didn't
let out any violence, which is good, since this movie describes a
survival(!) story and all the insane difficulties Hugh Glass faced!So it's also important to know that this movie doesn't tell a true
story! But it was strongly inspired by one! The Story of Hugh Glass!
You will sit in the cinema, on your couch, your chair or wherever, and
not believe what this man has gone through! CAUTION: Now comes the SPOILER PART: The writers took themselves some
freedom, which is acceptable. They obviously wanted the movie to send
out a different message! So let's find out what the movie got wrong and
if it was a good or bad decision to change it! First of Hugh Glass
didn't kill the bear himself. The Grizzly was shot down by his comrades
who came for his aid. (But we'll let him be the hero) He also did not
have a son, at least not a son that was in the troupe escaping from the
Arikara! So John Fitzgerald never killed his son! He and Jim Bridger
were the only ones who accepted to take care for Glass until his death
(only two men)! And Fitzgerald convinced Bridger to leave Glass after
about a week! But that was all they did... they left him to die alone!
There was also no missing Arikara daughter to be saved! But Glass did
crawl miles and miles for days! The wolves that brought down the bison
and were later on burned by the Indian who helped Glass, were real! But
he chased them away himself by screaming and brandishing his walking
stick. There was no Indian who saved his life. Also Hugh got back to
the camp by himself in search for vengeance! But arriving he found out,
that Fitzgerald had quit and joined the Army as a scout, which made him
a federal employee, and untouchable. For Glass to kill him now would be
to invite his own execution. So Fitzgerald got away with it! But Glass
found Bridger, who was overfilled with guilt and shame. Then seeing
again how young the boy was, and the fact that he had been heavily
influenced by Fitzgerald, Glass spared his life! In an Arikara attack
about 10 years later, Hugh Glass was eventually killed and scalped by
his enemies. So why not make a movie out of that story? Why these changes? The truth
is Glass never got his revenge on Fitzgerald. Having that in the movie
is the only thing I think about that bothers me sometimes! But then I
think about that awesome chase and fighting scene and I get it! I mean
its and "happy end"... well kind of! They wanted Leo to get his revenge
(and enlarging his reasons for it) even though in reality he never got
it! It's probably a matter of opinion whether you like or dislike the
writers decision! But independently of the plot, the acting: 10/10 (If
he doesn't get his Oscar this year I don 't know what to think
anymore), the camera: 10/10 (There are incredibly long takes you don't
even realize)! For the most people all the important categories will
score a 9 or 10/10 except the plot which everyone has to figure out for
themselves! So I decided to give the movie 9,5/10 which rounds for me
in Leos favor 10/10! I hope you liked this review, English isn't my
first language so I hope it was still easy enough to follow my
thoughts! Thanks for reading this review. Hamun!

I just got back from seeing The Revenant. Took my friend Helen to see
it- we're both poor so we had to see a matinée and pool our money
together. The movie is a total question mark. We both kept saying out
loud "What's going on???" To audible groans from our fellow audience
members. At one point, Helen got up and said "They're going to kill
Leo- might as well leave now." It was the scene where they put cloth
over his eyes after that bear attack. I convinced her to stay.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a 1800s frontiersman in the rural wilderness,
who's a fur trader. When their camp is attacked by vicious Indians
(Native Americans), they fight and then flee.Then a bear attacks DiCaprio and in a gruesome 10 minutes we witness
lot's of blood and screaming. I had to cover my eyes, and Helen went to
the bathroom during this horrid turning of events. Now it starts getting confusing. Leo's gang finds him, and because he
knows where they're going- they agree to carry him around on a
stretcher. But Tom Hardy, the evil one of the bunch, doesn't like this.
He's a power hungry mongrel. He insists they leave him for dead. But
DiCaprio's companion, someone who looks Native American too, pleas they
don't do that. But somehow- Leo gets abandoned, and the Native American
friend is killed by Hardy. Leo then discovers the dead body of his friend- and pursues to cross
the wilderness on his own. He befriends the Native Americans, saves a
woman from being raped, hooks up with ANOTHER Native American who looks
like his dead friend - and then has to hide in a dead horse because the
bad guys return. Then he finally gets back to camp, and seeks revenge
on Hardy. There's a final battle between them, and he finally kills
Hardy. Then he breathes heavily in the snow- see's a "spirit" of his dead
friend, and the camera blacks out before we know if he dies or not.
Just like the director did with his previous film, Birdman.Helen and I agree that while the movie was visually stunning, it didn't
make much sense. There was no character development. Leonardo Dicaprio
spends most of the movie mumbling. "I couldn't understand what he was
saying", Helen added. "He's supposed to be a fur trader. As a salesman,
he wasn't very customer focused. I like to hear what my salesman says
to me." We laughed at this, knowing it was a joke. But seriously- who
was DiCaprio's character? There's no backstory. Hardy was also poorly
written. Just evil to be evil. Everyone says Leo is winning an Oscar for this, and he does have some
scenes of intensity (his big Bear scene, his reflection in the cabin
towards the end)- but it's nuanced and not very showy. Hard to win when
you're too subdued. And the whole Native American war didn't make a lick of sense either.
What was the purpose for their battle? What benefit did either team
get? They were stuck in the middle of a cold, heartless deadline. Why
not make peace and work together?FINAL GRADE: C for Confusing!

2-words to describe this film: VISCERAL POEM. What with the brutal
exteriors the cast and crew had to endure the minimal dialogue that was
spoken only when necessary and the nonstop tour de force we witness
from the moment we see the bear attack and onwards the pace does not
let up on the relentless conflicts. Such as man vs nature; man vs man;
man vs God.Although brilliant this is a grim film against some spectacular
national parks in Montana; Alberta, Canada and even Argentina! So don't
expect to be uplifted at the end of this film. It plays like an opera
in its tragic scope and some of the brutal and heinous crimes we
witness and I am not talking about the bear attack only.Cinematography and camera close ups truly bring us very close to the
action with wide angle lens that gets close to a character's face. But
like I said it plays out like an opera whose usual scope is tragic as
at the end of this film in its wake is littered with dead and/or
mutilated bodies whether scalping and or castration. One person who
should not see this film is Bill Cosby!I am not giving it a 10 because it is a very angry film. It does have
its moments of redemption like when a Native American cares for
Dicaprio (Hugh Glass) and encloses him in a tepee to recover from his
bear wounds only later for a French frontier group to brutally hang the
native American.It speaks very negatively about human nature albeit true but
nevertheless it is a gut wrenching and draining film. After you see
this film go out and have a stiff drink to cathartically clean
yourself.

Just give Leonardo DiCaprio the Oscar now. That is how good he is in
this film. The surprise for me was how good everything else was.I went to see THE REVENANT under the impression that it was a brutal,
tough movie with a tour-de-force performance by Leo as a Mountain Man
who seeks revenge after being left for dead following a Grizzly Bear
attack...and I would be right...it had all that (the Grizzly Bear
attack is pretty, well, grisly). But it has so much more going for it.If you recall, Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu won the Oscar last
year for BIRDMAN, a picture that was a "stunt", in that he shot it to
appear that it took place in one long take - a stunt that ultimately
fell short for me. The good news here is that he tries the stunt, in
smaller doses, in this film and succeeds mostly. The opening scene is a
Native American attack on a group of Fur Trappers and is shot as one
long take that gives the feeling of chaos and uncertainty that this
sort of surprise attack would give. He also uses the long take
technique in the Bear attack, to show the isolation and the feeling of
"no way out" and, finally, he used it very well in the climactic fight
scene to show the visceral nature of the Mountain Men who's main
instinct is to just survive.There is sparse dialogue in this film and it that works well. These
"Mountain Men" are used to being alone in the wilderness, so this
sparseness of speech is apropro. The actors, then, need to use
expressions, gestures and posture to convey what is going on inside
their heads - and they do so. None more than DiCaprio who (literally)
has to claw his way out of the wilderness to survive and gives the type
of Award winning performance through action and expression that is
necessary for this film to succeed without going "over the top".Tom Hardy, yet again, is a formidable antagonist. Domhall Gleeson
continues to build on his resume with an impressive performance as the
Captain who just might be in over his head. The 4th main protagonist in
this film is a young Jim Bridger, played with strong naivete by Will
Poulter, who gets better every time I see him.Is this a great film? I don't think so. I think it is a very good film.
Innarritu has long stretches of "pretty pictures" that look STUNNING on
the screen but doesn't add much to the story, so the 2 hour, 36 minute
running time seems a bit bloated and there is a sub- plot about an
aging Native American searching for his daughter that I saw how it
would dovetail into main narrative a mile away.But these are quibbles in a very strong movie with strong direction and
an exceptional leading turn.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)

Very much like a "There Will Be Blood" type movie including length and
pace. Mix that in with "Brokeback Mountain" visuals and "Into the Wild"
type visuals and score. The latter I liked best out of the 3 movies
though I disliked them all. A cinematic achievement on some level
granted, but you have to remember Birdman made the film. Unending
disconnect from reality for me...the fall into the tree, that did it
for me. By that point, I laughed out loud. I attended a screening where
DiCaprio spoke and he at one point said he didn't think anyone would
find anything wrong with the film which I thought, was he joking? I
vacillate between that statement being so or serious.

A visually and aurally stunning film that captured and held my
attention from beginning to end - for those two reasons primarily. This
is a familiar story - albeit in a rather unique setting of unrelenting
cold and unforgiving wilderness - that has been told a multitude of
times before: a man's loving family is killed needlessly, man then
overcomes challenges to seek revenge and redemption. Therein, to me,
lies this film's greatest weakness and the main reason I did not rate
it higher - for all intents and purposes, we've seen the story before
and pretty much know instinctively how it will turn out. The story
really doesn't throw us much in the way of curves or unexpected turns.
As noted, the film's greatest strength lies in the production and sound
design and the stunning cinematography, both of which could be Oscar
worthy. While I am not a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, in my view he did an
admirable job getting across the pain and desperation of the main
character. I don't think I would go so far as to say that his
performance is Oscar worthy; in my view an actor must rise above
putting in a "solid and admirable performance" to get to the lofty
heights of an Oscar. For me, the other weakness in the film - and some
may not have found this the problem that I did - is Tom Hardy's
performance. While his characterization was outstanding and properly
menacing and nuanced, his accent was so thick at times that, despite a
good sound system, I was often unable to understand what he was saying.
This was unfortunately a major distraction for me as a viewer.
Nevertheless, I would highly recommend viewing this film at least once
primarily for the stunning visuals and sound design that makes you feel
that you are right there in nature with the characters on the screen.

So, let me see if I got this. The film that's made Leo a star should
have taught him that it's just impossible for a human to stay in the
ice cold water for longer than a couple of minutes: because of the body
temperature decrease, one's blood vessels contract so much, the heart
is no longer able to push through the life juice. And that's just one
thing... But nah, says Iñárritu. I'm gonna have DiCaprio body-raft down
the freezing cold mountain river, drop down a waterfall, float some
more and finally crawl ashore wearing a bear skin, which by that time
should have weighed about a hundred pounds. And we know, what happens
to a man enveloped in 100 lbs. of stuff in water. Those of us who have
seen a single medieval knight movie know for sure: man sinks like a
stone. Oh, well, says Iñárritu. That's what YOU think  and then
shatters Leo's right leg. Shatters to a point when it hangs by the skin
and tendon. At first Leo does take it hard  barely moves. A day (!)
later he crawls, using a crutch and a tiny stick for a splint. Another
couple of days pass and he is moving like a drunken hockey player,
though able to avoid all kinds of unwanted encounters, gathering and
hunting... Finally, perhaps, after no more than two weeks of healing,
he is running, mounting a horse on a fly, spurs it frantically, in
short, displays the kind of vigor rarely associated even with a
perfectly healthy individual, let alone someone who's spent days under
a snag in a forest But the film in itself is great. The kind of
achievement which could (and should, given the amount of pure garbage
on offer) cap the whole cinematographic year. What is sad though, is
that my problem with 'the ballads of the strength of the human spirit'
has not for the countless time been rectified. I still can't figure out
how to feel about the blatant untruths the film makers utilize in order
to make their characters' heroism truthful.

I could not ask for a better way of beginning 2016 that is for sure.
So, my review will begin by quoting an expression of my own, which was
said when the screenplay turned black and the lights tuned off: "What a
monstrous movie!" Monstrous in every sense, since the story, the
action, the scenarios, the actors' interpretation, until the directing. The story about The Revenant is quite simple to tell, once all the
juices rely on the scenarios and even more on the Actors' performance.
It is about an American, named Hugh Glass, that was on an expedition
throughout Native American territory searching for fur when he was
attacked by a bear. This animal almost killed him, so the group where
Glass was inserted considered him only a burden and left him behind to
face his own fate. What happens next is something amazing that show us
what the human being is capable of surviving whether the energy that
propel you is love or revenge. The scenario that serves The Revenant is absolutely astonishing and
creates in the spectator the desire of being there. The snow, the
rivers, the falls, even the storms are incredibly beautiful. All their
beauty is well capture in the screen and only raised the magnificence
of the movie. On top of that, all the scenes with the animals are also
incredible. Even if you know that they might be virtual, because some
scenes tend to be brutal and violent.But what transforms The Revenant in something of another level are the
actors. By seeing the cast we understand that this could be a good
movie, however, sometimes good casts generated poor movies, so I
usually do not deposit all my hopes on that. Of course that when you
have in the same movie Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, only good
things could happen. And let me tell you that in this movie only
incredible things happened! The performance of Leonardo DiCaprio (Hugh
Glass) was absolutely incredible. I have already heard that 2015 could
be the year for DiCaprio, and I have to beef up that idea because he
has a role that is out of this world. The evolution in the screen is
incredible since he passes from a relatively calm guy with a dark past
to a vengeful man with fire in his eyes. And the spectator will share
with him all the anger and desire for blood. But in the end we learned
a lesson, and in my opinion that is all what matters when you see a
movie: what you take home. There are particular scenes that enhance the
spectacular performance of DiCaprio but in the end I have to say that
all the picture is set to finally Leonardo DiCaprio become an Oscar
winner. And what could I say about Tom Hardy? Oh my god! If Hugh Glass
become only alive because of an incredible Leonardo DiCaprio, John
Fitzgerald only make sense with Tom Hardy. If you will love Glass, you
will hate Fitzgerald. And all the love and hate are only possible
because not just DiCaprio is astonishing, Tom Hardy blew up in this
movie and features one of the best performances that I have already
seen from him. At the beginning Fitzgerald is only a mere pawn but as
the action developed, you understand is role on the movie that
culminates with an astonishing class with Glass. Therefore, I truly recommend The Revenant and I have scored it with an
8/10. You will not regret the 180 minutes of the movie, because it has
the ability of capturing your attention the entire time. It is an
awesome movie, incredibly directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. Is beauty
relies in every aspect, every detail, so do not detour your attention
from the big or small screen.

It has been written, in the past, that all works of drama consist of
only a few concepts. Whether it is true or not is not something that
I've considered until now; now being because of some event that kindled
a past education. Such is this film.It is Man against Man. It is Man against Nature. And, it is Man against
Self. Is there another that I am forgetting? If there is another,
hopefully by the end of this, I will have realized.Leonardo vs. Tom, that is Man against Man.Leonardo vs. Bear, that is Man against Nature.Leonardo vs. The Elements, that is Man against Self.

The revenant is a survival and a "godly" revenge movie. The movie was
great, the plot that is based on a novel by Mark Smith that I didn't
read has a really good story that it is based around the time when
Europeans landed on America. The fight for survival of native Americans
v. the invaders which leads to much killings and less understanding.Alejandro did an amazing job on directing he also did the screenplay
which was on the top. Photography was stunning, the camera work is
amazing and one camera shoots scenes these days are rare. Acting
starting from Leo was phenomenal, not going to start bragging but the
dude did an amazing job he was spectacular. This must be the movie that
he talks the least than in other movies but still good job done by him
on the other aspects. Tom is just confirming that he is a top class
actor, if Leo doesn't win anything for this then Tom totally deserves
it for supporting role. A nice addition was that comet that I have to mention.Also the end credit which was mixed with Leo's breath was a nice
additional little thing as we know masterpieces are achieved on
details. Overall great movie with amazing editing, directing, camera and
screenplay. Great performance by Leo and Tom, maybe maybe this will be
your year guys.

Acclaimed & Oscar-winning filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu went
from a Birdman seeking redemption to a Frontiersman seeking revenge.
His latest stellar work comes in the form of "The Revenant". It stars
Leonardo DiCaprio as the aforementioned 1800's frontiersman named Hugh
Glass who seeks vengeance against his fellow frontiermen who left him
for dead after a bear attack. I guess they could not bear seeing Glass
in such pain or maybe not. Glass is made out of thick glass with his
focused resiliency to get those who did him wrong. Let's just say that
he has viable justification to be an angry man. Oh, and as far as his
marital status: he once had a love and it was no gas, soon turned out
it was the heart of Hugh Glass; sorry for that "Blondie" moment there.
Anyways, Inarritu marveled with his courageous direction of "The
Revenant". His script of the picture, which he co-wrote with Mark
Smith, was a revelation on revenge; but this movie shines more with the
physical than the verbose and that is its brilliant makeup. Two-time
cinematography Oscar champ Emmanuel "Chivo" Lubezki presented what is
probably one of the most breathtaking photography I have seen in a
motion picture with his work in "The Revenant"; y no estoy chivando!
Now to Mr. DiCaprio! It is one of my favorite Leo performances and it
is his most impressive physical thespian effort of his illustrious
career with his Glassified offering. Tom Hardy was exceptional as
Fitzgerald the Frontiersman. Other fine supporting performances derived
from Will Poulter as Bridges the Frontiersman, and Domhnall Gleeson as
Captain Henry. In the end, "The Revenant" is something to see. *****
Excellent

The Revenant is such a good movie,definitely filled my
expectations,although I watched downloaded leaked version it's still
one of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen. Leonardo Di
Caprio did excellent job as Hugh Glass,on the screen and off the
screen. Some parts of the movie where he is hurt are so brilliant,also
the scene with the bear are one of the best I have ever seen. Movie has
great sounds,from nature,from actors,Di Caprio to be specific.
Nature,panoramas are amazing,the story is good. Leo had a very short
dialogue,but that didn't stop him to put everything he has in this
role. I think he definitely has a potential to win an Oscar.

Awesome in every way. From the breath taking scenes, to the wonderful
and masterful use of music/bgm to the amazing story.I'll keep it short and sweet. This movie shines in how much Glass had
to struggle and fight for every second. I could really feel that
wind/chill and I could really feel the serenity of those quiet moments.
Like Gravity, this movie is absolutely an experience. The Story was ...
well it was alright. The ending was satisfying. There were moments
where I was sad but nothing jerked any tears out of me. It kept me at
the edge of my seat for most of the duration, so hats off to that.Its got drama, strife, survival and combat. It was a real trip. So the
bottom line is that this movie imo didn't blow me away story-wise but
it was one hell of an experience. Hardy and DiCaprio did an amazing
job. The other actors played their parts very well too. It really did
feel like DiCaprio had to give his all in order to pull it off and he
did. I cant imagine anyone giving more.All-in-all, I think its a must see. Or at the very least, it's an
experience that you'll be pretty sorry you missed. Definitely worth
every single minute.

So "The Revenant" is not a landmark film. It will not be remembered as
a one of a kind, as a cinematic masterpiece, or as a total disaster. It
isn't either because it does have some striking photography, and now I
understand why I am not going to be spending Winter in Canada or the
most northern states of the U.S. It also cements the fact that humans
are one of the meanest species on the planet both on and off the
screen.To summarize, Hugh Glass has some rotten luck. His wife and son are
killed. He's mauled and barely survived by a scared and testy Grisly.
Then, he's left for dead by two men who were supposed to take care of
him, and in ways that asks for to believe in the impossible and put
Superman or any of the Justice League super heroes to shame, he makes
it back to the fort, defying hypothermia, frostbite, every possible
infection in the world, and other angry humans. Oh yes... he's alive at
the end.It is an impressive production when we consider what the actors and the
crew probably had to go through. It looks cold. It feels cold, both in
its physical presentation and its connection to the audience. With the
exception of Hardy's thrilling performance as the insecure and
treacherous hunter, we are witness to the lead actor (or his stand-in)
enduring some of the most difficult situations you can torture a human
being with. We are to believe that he had to consume some raw meat and
fish, being bounced around by what I assume were some type of actors
inside a bear rug skin, subject himself to some inclement weather (I
sure hope he packed his moisturizer), in addition to riding horses,
shooting guns, avoid arrows, and swimming in freezing river waters.The score was fitting and unobtrusive. There were a couple of moments
when it got loud, but I suppose it fit the scene. Unlike the deafening
interruptions of the gorgeous music in "The Danish Girl", this was
bearable. We survived it. The fantastic composition, all done with
natural light was at some moments, breathtaking. I wanted to run and
buy the companion coffee table book. Then, I remembered that I had seen
a similar and arguably, more beautiful and spiritually resonant set of
visuals in that Malick movie that came out a few years ago.There was some good work by the supporting cast, particularly Gleeson,
who managed to steal the role of best villain in "Force Awakens", and
he's now proving his versatility here, as a leader with strict
discipline but enough heart and fairness to protect his charges. Will
Poulter is just standing around and not doing much, trying to hold his
own against Hardy, who is as threatening as the surrounding
environment. One look is enough to freeze us in our tracks, pretty much
like that wild grisly. I was left wondering whether the mama bear could
have stood a chance against Fitzgerald.Finally, I have to admit that this was a difficult production. It's all
up there on the screen, but I was also wondering how much of it was
necessary. It seemed to me like they could have filmed half of it in a
more welcoming environment, with the help of some good blue or green
screen. Also, the movie was a tad long, with some of moments which
lovingly portrayed the savage beauty of the north, adding at least
another 30 minutes that the film didn't need. If we had all those
beautiful shots, why didn't we get more of the aurora Borealis? Last
but not least is the whole premise that there was just too much
violence, yet it felt distant. Maybe the audience just got numb and
shut down because 20 minutes into the film, we stopped caring about
what would happen to them. We knew he would make it, and we had little
emotional involvement to care for Glass, his mates, or the indians.

Hugh Glass is a military scout. With his Indian half-breed son Hawk, he
serve in with John Fitzgerald, and Jim Bridger under Commander Andrew
Henry, tasked to hunt animal pelts. They have to face both the Indians
and the French. While hunting, Glass returns back to camp after hearing
a commotion when the Indians attack. They flee to the river as the
attack kills 33 men. Fitzgerald suggest a route but Glass suggest an
opposite route. Henry listens to Glass and they rest for the night. At
first light Glass goes ahead first as Hawk remains with the company.
But Glass enters a Grizzly bear's domain and gets attacked viciously.
He manages to kill the beast, but his throat is injured badly, making
him unable to speak. The company finds him and carries him. Fitzgerald
suggests to leave Glass as apparently they can't save him. Eventually
Henry gives up, but he insists that Glass die naturally, promising
money for three men who stay with Glass. Hawk and Bridger volunteer,
and surprisingly so did Fitzgerald.But Fitzgerald gets impatient, offering Glass a quick death if he just
blinks. Glass closes his eyes for some time, and when he opens them
Fitzgerald considers it as blinking then tries to kill him. Hawk
catches Fitzgerald and the two struggle, but eventually Fitzgerald
kills Hawk. Bridger comes and Fitzgerald convince him to bury Glass
alive in a shallow grave. He stops as Glass is neck deep. Glass crawls
out of his grave, surviving on eating bits and pieces until he can
stand again. Able to walk, Glass meets an Indian man carving meat from
a dead beast. Glass begs for some and the man gives, but he faints
after eating. The Indian is actually pursuing his daughter Powaqa's
kidnappers. He helps Glass after he explains his ordeal. The man builds
Glass a makeshift shelter when they face a blizzard. When Glass wakes
up the man has gone. Glass finds a French trappers' camp, and waits
until nightfall then readies to steal a horse. A French man brings an
Indian girl and rapes her near Glass. He rescues the girl and they
escape on a stolen horse, but Glass dropped the flask Bridger left him.The girl leaves Glass and The French pursuers catches up on him, so he
runs off of a cliff, killing his horse. As another blizzard looms,
Glass removes the horse's entrails and use the carcass as a cocoon. One
of the French wanders into Henry's fort, bringing the Bridger's flask.
Henry wonders if it's the missing Hawk, so they set out to find him.
They instead find Glass himself. Henry rides back ahead but Fitzgerald
had already gone with the company's money. Glass reveals the truth,
asking supplies to hunt Fitzgerald. Henry goes with him. As Glass spots
a camp's smoke in the wilderness, he and Henry check it out from
opposite directions. But Henry meets Fitzgerald, who then kills him.
Glass finds the body and uses it to lure Fitzgerald out. He succeeds
and they fight a bloody melee. Glass finally has the upper hand and
readies his killing blow. But he spots a band of Indians up the river
and remembers the words of the previous Indian man that revenge is in
God's hands, and he lets Fitzgerald floats on the current to them, who
kills him.Another great movie this month, The Revenant (2015) is full of great
work in acting, directing and effects. The story is like other revenge
movies, although I don't think the movie was clear enough at it.
There's a lot of unnecessary footage if we see it story-wise. There are
quite a lot of other story elements which are not concluded in the end.But I must say again that the movie is a gem technical-wise. It's a
beautiful sight to see. Inarritu was very kind in supplying us with
another trick up his sleeve. Here you see a lot of mind bending close
up shots of crazy stunts. They are enabled by the help of moving camera
and impeccable timing execution that lets it require less editing.There are many moments where the movie builds up suspense with the
camera closing up on the actors, pans away, rotates to view the
surroundings, and suddenly we have them getting shot at point blank.
The special effects are done well that the stunts achieved their
intended effect. Many times I was left behind as I was wondering how
did they rigged the stunt that just happened when suddenly the movie
just shoves another crazy stunt in my face.The cinematography is great. Emmanuel Lubezki is really looking like
he's aiming for another Oscar. Aside from the great job on the main
story elements, there are also very pretty photography in this movie.
Lubezki did a great job in capturing the spirit of the location to
insert into the movie.The acting overall is just superb. Leonardo DiCaprio did great in
handling the dominant focus his character has as the entire movie
mostly centers on Glass. Tom Hardy managed to bend himself into yet
another believable character, despite the original reasoning of his
apathy to Glass' ordeal remains unclear. Domnhall Gleeson's star is
clearly rising steadily, as he secured roles in three acclaimed movie
this year so far; here, Star Wars Episode VII, and Ex Machina. Will
Poulter nicely adds depth to the whole story, as with the native
American cast.For me The Revenant (2015) deserves a 7 out of 10 score. It would have
been more enjoyable for the ordinary people if there's less duration
that only contains silence. I did enjoy the movie though, yet I don't
think many other ordinary people will too.

Alejandro González Iñárritu who directed last year's Best Picture
winner 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' has returned
with his next film 'The Revenant'. The films couldn't be further apart
in nature. I remember saying when I reviewed the former film that it
wasn't going to be for everyone, and despite the films being worlds
apart, this fact remains the same. 'The Revenant' is a beautiful film
to look at, but it's a tough film to sit through. There's a pretty
amazing true story being told here, but it's being told in such a slow,
drawn out way that it lost a lot of impact for me. The buzz around town is that the time may finally have come for
Leonardo DiCaprio to get an Oscar for his performance in 'The
Revenant'. Personally I would be disappointed if this turns out to be
the case. Don't get me wrong he delivers a very fine performance here.
But of all the charismatic, layered performances he's given over the
years, this was not his best work. People will justify it saying the
filming conditions were immensely tough and that he put in the hard
yards for the role, however the I believe any actor given this role
could have come up with a very similar performance. There was nothing
DiCaprio did here that no one else in the business could have pulled
off. That hasn't been the case in other roles he's nailed.Be prepared going in to 'The Revenant'. Be prepared to be very patient.
It's a long film with not a lot happening for the most part of it. The
flaw for me was how much time was given to each aspect of the story.
The survival aspect takes up 95% of the time, which granted was a great
way to show just how harrowing of an experience it would truly have
been and the determination it would have taken, and the "revenge"
aspect is just rushed in at the end almost as an afterthought. For mine
the ratio needed to be closer to 80-20% for the sake of an audience who
are demanding a more satisfactory ending.

This is a typical revenge movie. But the director was taking out
revenge against the audience. Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio gave good
performances, though not Oscar worthy. Other actors played their parts,
got paid and went home. This 2 1/2 hour movie contained 1 1/2 hours of
material and 1 hour of nature scenery that added nothing to the story.
His would have seen a fairly decent film if these extraneous scenes
were cut. The music droned on and made me want to go to sleep. That
being said, many people leaving the theater seemed to like the movie.
Though one couple walked out at the 1 1/2 hour point not to return. I
would not recommend seeing this movie unless you've seen everything
else and are bored.

I recently came across the story of Glass briefly when reading TC
Boyles "The Harder They Come", and since this book increased my already
big fondness for pioneer or realistic wild west settings, I was looking
forward eagerly for a new big budget movie that promised to capture the
pioneer era atmosphere in a grim survival story.The movie starts out awesome enough, kicking off with a powerful
Indians vs Pioneers battle scene that features incredibly long,
action-packed shots. Unlike in the original story the movie is based
on, Glass brings his half-Indian son along, creating some father/son
moments and some tension with the other guys on his trek who are not
that fond of savages. Shortly after, we are treated to the high point
of the movie - the already famous bear scene, which is masterfully
done, and painful to watch for its cruel realism. Unfortunately, from there, it is all downhill.The whole point of the original story, Fitzgerald and Bridger leaving
Glass behind, gets watered down by the state Glass is pictured to be in
- the way it is shown in the movie, it would have obviously been the
only logical thing to do to leave him behind, with the Indians on the
trek's tail and his chances of survival being nil. Rather than creating a believable dilemma, the movie goes all over-
the-top in Hollywood clichés. Instead of just leaving a maimed Glass
behind for dead, Fitzgerald kills Glass'es son, turning a survival
story into a revenge thriller. We are shown all kinds of bad aspects of
Fitzgerald's character to turn him into "the bad guy" so we can root
for Glass killing him at the end.At the same time, the whole Indian side-story that was courageous
enough to show Indians as ruthless attackers and not stick to the
"noble savage" cliché gets watered down with an unbelievable silly
twist when it is revealed that the Indians are just searching for the
chieftain's kidnapped daughter, which we later find out was kidnapped
by those pesky French, who do all kinds of badguy Indian killing stuff
(as opposed to our noble pelt hunters, who are righteous decent human
beings with the exception of the traitor Fitzgerald).The actual survival story then gets completely out of hand, being so
over-the-top as to remind me of action movies like Die Hard 2, that do
not claim to be realistic and do not take themselves as serious as this
movie. Glass, still in a state where he can only crawl, escapes the
Indians by jumping into an ice-cold river, gets thrown down waterfalls,
gets on a horse, falls down a cliff of around 100ft, etc etc etc. At
this point, the survival story failed to grip me, since it was
obviously based on comic book physics and -realism. It gets even more ridiculous, when Glass manages to find the time on
his survival ego trip to befriend a lone Indian (who is later killed by
the evil, evil French, but not before healing Glass with some Indian
sweat lodge magic), and even to rescue the Indian chieftain's daughter
who was held prisoner as a rape object by the French, who again
thankfully stepped in to fill in for the bad guys.Despite all of this, the movie manages to stay pretty enjoyable (and
never boring) until the ending, which was so horribly predictable that
it made me cringe. First Glass meets up with the rest of the trek, looking extremely
healthy for what he's supposedly been through - DiCaprio could have at
least lost some weight for this movie, or otherwise they could have
used CGI to make him look thinner. Fitzgerald escapes from the camp, stealing the money from the rest of
the crew in the process (that baddie bad guy!). For some reason, even
though they still have plenty of other men left, only Glass and the
Captain set out as a group of two to hunt Fitzgerald down.When the Captain then tells Glass some sentimental crap about his wife
when they sit down at a fire at night, he might have just as well put
on a red Star-Trek shirt, because it couldn't have been made any more
obvious that he would be shot in the lead-up to the inevitable showdown
between Glass and Fitzgerald.Predictably enough, thats exactly what happens. To make matters worse,
we are not only treated to the good old "both antagonists lose their
weapons so it degenerates into a fist fight" cliché, but then, as the
predictable fight, that tries to make up in cruelty what it lacks in
innovation, inevitably ends with our hero Glass beating Fitzgerald and
threatening to cut his throat, Fitzgerald tells him in a typical
bad-guy way that killing him won't bring back his son, AND SO GLASS
REFUSES TO KILL HIM. Are you kidding me? You just ruined the whole
point of turning a survival story into a revenge trip, and lost the
last bit of credibility the story had until now.But of course we cannot let the bad guy get away, and so the actual
killing is done by the Indians, who arrive just in time to finish
Fitzgerald off and stare silently at Glass in a menacing silent Indian
cliché thing. Since Glass saved his daughter's life, the Indian
chieftain refrains from killing Glass, and instead rides off silently
without acknowledging or helping the wounded Glass lying on the ground
who saved his daughter's life. Makes sense.The movie fades out with a shot of Glass staring into nothing. At least
he didn't go after the chieftain's daughter to make some more Indian
half-breed babies and live happily forever after.6/10

I had big expectations for this movie ! It has a big star starring in
it , a big artistic director , a good concept and story , but it lacks
the most important thing ; it lacks the SOUL .. !! It's a very slow
paced movie , no thrill at all , I mean Leo is a good actor , but
acting is not only about being on the screen ALONE most of the time ,
crawling , moaning and grunting without any interactions with the
surroundings or other people... Other thing is that , there is nothing
at all would make me love the character , why would I believe in a man
who is seeking revenge for the death of his son , while I didn't feel
that the father is loving the son actually , he didn't say once that he
loved him , even the dialogues between them are very cold , come on ,
he didn't cry when he died ! I would say that the only thing that is
good is the picture and the cinematography itself ...Otherwise , Leo , sorry bro , no Oscar this time ...

It pains me to see a director fall from grace. I completely loved
Birdman and was highly anticipating this film. Unfortunately, Innaritu
dropped the ball on this one. First off, let me say that this isn't a COMPLETE disaster of a film.
There is some spectacular cinematography through the duration of the
movie, especially in the opening sequence which I wont give away. Also,
as seen in the trailer, there's an encounter with a bear that's
completely over-the-top intense and will bring you to the edge of your
seat. The score is hauntingly brilliant and fits the bleak, desolate
setting of the story really well. But the movie literally fails at
everything else.I've never been huge on Leonardo. I used to really admire him a few
years ago, but since I started paying closer attention to cinema, I
realize he's a competent actor without much else. This movie only
solidifies my opinion. I don't care how many animal carcasses Leonardo
sleeps in, or how many hearts he eats, or how many times he commits
bodily harm; the guy isn't a great actor. His performance in this movie is quite bad. He seldom speaks, but when
he does he bears the look of a man who's trying beyond all belief to be
convincing. He makes a very poor attempt at an accent and it's honestly
far from an Oscar-worthy performance. I felt really sorry for Tom
Hardy, the only actor who made a great presentation.Not only was DiCaprio's acting bad, but his character was shockingly
underwritten. On top of that, I didn't care about his motivation at all
because his son had literally no characterization whatsoever. We're
supposed to accept his paternal relationship without any creative
twists or exhibitions. It's really shallow and disappointing. I can't
remember the last time I saw so much wasted potential. Innaritu treats
the audience like a bunch of idiots and slaps us over the head with
predictable and schmaltzy characterization techniques. Fitzgerald,
Hardy's character, was the only person in the story that had any depth
or mystery. I found myself gravitating towards him more than anyone
else. If the villain is the most relatable figure in a revenge movie,
then the script is essentially broken. Glass, as played by Leo, serves as little more than a punching bag for
the movie's setting. It's a dull, overplayed, miserable affair that
actually gets laughable towards the end. It's indisputable proof that
too much of a good thing can turn bad real quick. By the time the final
credits came on, I knew utterly nothing of Hugh Glass other than he can
endure a lot of pain. Also, he loves his son, in case you never picked
up on it when the director was constantly bludgeoning you over the head
with verbal reminders. It's like an episode of the Dick Van Dyke Show
set in the American frontier, only there's no heart, joy, or
creativity.Overall, you should save your money. Besides the magnificent score and
the shots of the wilderness, this is a lifeless snooze. I have no
problem with violence or suffering in film, but when it's all incurred
by a poorly acted and boring man, it doesn't amount to anything. It's
style over substance with little to offer the viewer. Having said that,
I wouldn't be surprised if it won best picture. People seem to have
forgotten the value of resounding stories and characters.

Nobody could have survived HALF of what glass went thru. In the middle
of winter? No drugs or wound care at all? No gangrene? And then his
horse runs off a cliff and he falls into a tree and survives? At that
point I actually LAUGHED OUT LOUD because the plot had become so
ridiculous.I've been reading about this being DiCaprio's Oscar attempt, but I
can't imagine that this will get him anything. And if it does, it will
be appalling that of all the movies this year, that this piece of
masturbatory garbage gets any attention at all except for utter
derision. The plot was completely unbelievable. The acting was atrocious. The
editing was not existent. It was as unpalatable as watching two hours
of torture porn. My wife left after the first 30 minutes.This movie should not win anyone any award.

If this wasn't such a fantastic piece of storytelling, I would be
interrupting every three minutes to ask "how the hell did they make
that shot?" Even if you know a lot about special effects, this film
will have you scratching your head all the time.There are shots that start as close ups, go super wide, half way up a
mountain and then close to something else miles away. There are
interactions with animals like the bear, shot in a way that defies any
cinematographic, animal training, prop, or other trick you can think
of.I can't wait to see some sort of "making of" that will allow me to
sleep at night when I understand how they did it all. Instead of that
jerky, overdone, getting us all motion sick, hand-held camera, there is
a wide angle system which sucks you into the action in a way we haven't
see before.It doesn't matter if you don't like DiCaprio or dislike "that type" of
movies. This is an awesome piece of work, worth watching regardless
simply for the technical artistry.

After viewing this movie, one realizes this film will be remembered
more for one harrowing scene (the well-known Grizzly Bear attack) and
the way it was made, rather than for the quality of the story or filmic
experience itself.DiCaprio, as Hugh Glass, does an adequate job, although 2/3's of his
acting involves emoting-through-wheezing. For that alone, almost any
competent actor with a range greater than Adam Sandler could have done
the part. We get brief glimpses of interesting characters (Domhnall
Gleason's Army Lieutenant for one) and way too many scenes of a one-
dimensional antagonist, Tom Hardy's Fitzgerald. And the film could have
been 20 minutes shorter by eliminating long, meditative (or creatively
masturbatory) shots of trees.Already dining out on the "we shot in only natural light! Shot over
nine months in the miserably cold outdoors," the film-makers seem
unaware that a difficult production with good actors does not
necessarily a great movie make. Just ask the folks who made (or
un-made, depending on who you ask) "The Island of Dr. Moreau." Tough
shoot...apparently a terrible movie."The Revenant" isn't terrible, but it's nowhere near great.

I guess this film is OK if you like 2.5 hours of un-narrated Bear
Grylls with some landscape shots to act as filler content. Leonardo
DeCaprio and Tom Hardy deliver brilliant acting, but they can't save a
boring plot in a film that should have been at least an hour shorter.
Its a big production with great costumes, great acting and great
visuals... the problem is that nothing happens. Its not an art film
like e.. Valhalla Rising where you can enjoy the slow pace since the
producer is trying to do something different. Here you just fall asleep
and the only thing keeping you awake is the expectation that the star
cast will somehow save it in the end. Too bad they don't

Beautiful. Captivating. Awe-inspiring.I could fill the page with adjectives, but unfortunately none can
characterize The Revenant's underlying ethos. Instead, I put forth my
best effort to string together the most fitting collection of words I
can find.Set in North America during the mid 1800s, you are immediately taken
back by the gorgeous shots of an immense wilderness. One particular pan
starts at the forest floor and slowly meanders up, passing through
multiple vantage points. The progression grasps our attention and,
spellbound, we gasp in wonder, lost in the scenery, until an arrow
whizzes across our view and strikes the tree next to us. Ambush.
Indians. Our momentary shock transforms to adrenaline: we are not
watching a film; we are in the film. It is perception with pathos,
instinctual prowess, an experience intensely personal, that the camera
shots from The Revenant capture. Whether we join DiCaprio helplessly
lying on his back mauled by a bear, a member of his company, young and
afraid, listening to the antagonist justify his actions, or the vast,
indifferent omniscience of Nature constantly dwarfing its inhabitants,
the cinematography employs a novel, awe-inspiring use of first-person
perspective. And director Alejandro González Iñárritu refuses to let us
go until we see the deepest, most primal part of ourselves.As with all great works of art, it ends accusingly, accosting us with
the hard hitting questions we prefer to ignore most of our life. Why am
I here? Who am I? What do I live for? At the end of the film, we
realize that The Revenant perhaps does not refer to Hugh Glass, the
protagonist and fur trader on the cusp of obscurity, but rather each
individual in the audience, renewed with a catharsis that beckons
introspection. Questions old as humanity resurface as we follow the
pioneer whose quest for vengeance disguises, albeit poorly, the greater
narrative of survival in a hostile, primeval Continent. Some decry the
film's apathetic treatment of the protagonist's quest. Indeed, ego
would have that the individual be the center of attention, especially
in a fantastic tall tale of an American folk hero using self-willed
determination to achieve his ends. But that's not what speaks here. A
gigantic female bear decidedly mounts our mighty, masculine hero,
clambers to the edge of the camera shot, then decides she wants seconds
and climbs back on top of our broken, emasculated adventurer. Later, a
Bison herd peppers the screen as a glistening sunrise floods the
horizon. Nowhere in sight is that supposedly larger-than-life hero.
Certainly, this is an affront to the nation whose ideology prides
itself upon self-efficacy, where one's individual efforts correlate
with success. Where the American dream is, at its essence, an
ego-centric one. How dare this foreign director bastardize a classic
American fable with anachronistic inklings of modernism. Perhaps it is
this stark apathy towards the protagonist and his story that strikes a
discordant chord in those who decry the surface level narrative. Your
ego leaves the theater starved, not satiated. However, if you can
forego the importance of plot, particularly one that depends upon a
definitive, predictable, and moral resolution, as well as a fixation on
character, given Glass's archetypal, primitive presentation (decidedly
more pessimistic critics use the term "flat"), you will leave the film
noticeably jarred, not because it offers explicit philosophical
intricacy, but rather by bringing out the internal, primordial
conflicts that threaten our psyche.It accomplishes this by mirroring our own instinctual tendencies.
Spirituality manifests itself through underlying trauma. Narrative
manifests itself through underlying absurdity. This particular history
of an insignificant retributive mountain-man is categorically
irrelevant, no different from any other organism willed to survive. As
the first-person camera shots travel indiscriminately across
perspectives, it becomes clear that nature treats all beings with equal
disinterest, regarding neither nation, color, or species. It fills the
vast wilderness with fantastic works of conception, all the while
indifferent to the particular particles of mortal sentience that, for a
brief time, populate it. This revelation that occurs during or after
the film causes us to revisit the fundamental reasons we give ourselves
for living. The Revenant, at its core, touches our soul. It is an
exercise in existentialism, an intriguing infusion of modernism into
American folk lore, and a captivating tribute to those that sacrificed
everything so we could watch their struggles in high definition whilst
sitting safely on plushy, cushioned chairs, munching on excessively
buttered popcorn, and gulping down artificial concoctions of
sugar-infused carbonation. It is, in short, the best film in recent
memory: one that transcends the flimsy, banal metrics of the era,
whether manifested as a fickle, five-star meter on IMDb, a
self-gratifying awards show, or a snobby film critic. Don't let these
red herrings fool you, The Revenant is a wonderful work of art. And, as
they tend to do, you will find yourself more appreciative, perhaps more
aware too, of the life you've been given, the others that are in it,
and the world that conceived it. But only if you choose to put the ego
away for a brief few hours, engaging honestly with and immersing
yourself in another's beautiful, grandiose vision. The Revenant serves
us, to quote Fitzgerald's closing lines of Gatsby, "a transitory
enchanted momentan aesthetic contemplationneither understood nor
desiredsomething commensurate to" our "capacity for wonder".

Thought to be a burden an injured man, Huge Glass, is left for dead.
After his son is murderer he then begins a journey of recovery and
revenge.Set in 1823, like the comparable Outlaw of Josey Wales, the characters
feel real and are motivated, they all have shades of grey. However,
director Alejandro G. Iñárritu excels the aforementioned in scope
thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, natural lighting and
advancements in film making. The Revenant is beautifully shot and
really captures the cold outdoors authentically. It's realistic, harsh
and uncompromising, showing the best and the worst of man. It captures
the bitter coldness that survival films, the likes of Alive, The Edge
and Deadly Pursuit a.k.a Shoot to Kill only touched on. The relentless
breathtaking bear attack is as intense as Leonardo DiCaprio's committed
performance as he fights to survive and avenge his son's death. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald cements the absorbing drama, his character
like the natives and French offer justified, cold, punishing brute
force from each others perspectives in contrast to the silence and
beauty of nature. Thanks to the excellent performances, props, costumes
and locations it's easy to buy into the story.The Revenant is a tour de force ultimate endurance tale and has heart
and soul. The sober moments and relationship scenes with the indigenous
characters are interesting, the history feels well researched. Gleeson
as with Star Wars Force Awakens is average but engaging, DiCaprio and
Hardy are outstanding along with the supporting cast. Will Poulter's
involvement is particularly notable.It's very serious and justly is void of humour, but has irony woven
throughout. From a horse falling from cliff, to wolves attacking bison,
eating raw meat, avalanches and waterfalls, log cabins, outposts and
tepees. It's a great frontier revenge survival thriller with multi
layers. Recommend.

The Revenant (2016) Review: One of the anticipated releases of this
year "The Revenant" by the famous Oscar winning director with a tuff to
pronounce name Alejandro Inarritu marks its entry initially as a
survival genre or a thriller flick. But I felt there are lots of
revelations in the story which is "based on true events" (one tagline
of Hollywood now a day which is more sellable). So I felt the movie was
trying to be close to reality but given an insight says it has
cinematic elements added to it. Story is about a hunting group for
pelts who are attacked by local tribes. A man who guides them through
their journey along with their captain. Situations gets worse when they
split due to worse wounded guide cannot carry on with the team. Then
the story transforms from a survival phase to a grief built revenge
thriller which dwells into man versus nature type (both real nature and
human nature). Let's see what is on the plus or positive side of the
movie: Not just one but so many facets about the movie strongly holds
up to the expectations. 1. Captivating story line. 2. Intense
screenplay which keeps us connected to the story. 3. Spectacular
cinematography that brings us the wilderness of the untamed mountains
and nature. 4. Laudable performances by the leads both the protagonist
Glass essayed by Di caprio and the antagonist Fitzgerald essayed by Tom
Hardy. Leonardo Di Caprio has already been a strong candidate in the
Oscars and he makes sure his entry this time as well but as far as
winning we should wait for the academy to decide. 5. Commendable
grizzly Bear attack sequence which makes the hero barely survive. What
is on the minus side of the movie: 1. I am not convinced 100% with the
reality factor that a man surviving after witnessing an attack by
nearly a ton heavy bear where he is teared apart ripped off and
punctured several times mercilessly. 2. The story happens in the 18th
century but the seasons or rightly weather changes upside down from the
starting scene from a rainy forest which hardly snows to a thick
snowing mountains though we are not given any reference on the time. 3.
Length of the movie which is 156 mins.Verdict : A movie to feel the cinematic experience on big screens.
Rating 7.5/10

"My heart bleeds. But revenge is in the creator's hands".The Revenant is set in the 1820s, in the uncharted wilderness of
America, Hugh Glass set out with a hunting party on an expedition.
Glass was mauled by a bear and left for dead but through sheer will and
to get back to his family, Glass survived - but that wasn't the only
thing on his mind as he set out to payback the men who left him behind.I remember last year around January time when I saw the two images for
The Revenant, with Leo holding a Kentucky Flintlock Rifle looking like
he's not playing around. Just by those two images caught my interest. I
then found out it was directed by the magnificent Alejandro González
Iñárritu who did the Oscar wining "Birdman" (A movie that I personal
loved). The Revenant quickly became my most anticipated movie of 2015,
as I was looking forward to this movie more than Star Wars, and yes I
said it. And after finally seeing the movie myself, I can safely say
that I was not disappointed. The Revenant is one of the most stunning,
brutal, intense, grizzly movie experience I've ever had. The movie
isn't for everyone, but I loved it.Alejandro González Iñárritu is starting to become my 3rd favorite
director working today, because he's such an old school director when
it comes to storytelling by the use of art. There's been a lot of drama
happening behind the scenes of this movie, with the weather stopping
the production or if someone made a mistake while filming, the crew
must stop for the day and wait until tomorrow, because one mistake
could lose a lot of day light for a scene (It was shot in natural
lighting). One of the studios suggested that the movie should be shot
using computer generated to make things much easier, but luckily
Iñárritu said no to the idea by stating, "If we ended up in green
screen with coffee and everybody having a good time, everybody will be
happy, but most likely the film would be a piece of sh*t." And after
seeing the movie I gotta say that it was the perfect decision, because
it's very rare for a director today to take that risk and avoid what
the studio says. Yes there are some CGI scenes, but the way that the
animated effect's blended together with the practical effect's is
handled incredibly well. This is one of the best directed I've seen in
2015 and I know Iñárritu already won an Oscar already, but I hope he
wins another one for this, because never before have I seen a revenge
tale presented so unique and utterly magnificent.I respect Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor, but in this movie, he sleeps
inside of a dead horse naked and eats raw food from animals, now if
this doesn't get him an Oscar, nothing will. He's performance in this
movie is what a call ''a silent performance'', because Leo barley has
that much lines in the movie and the only time he dose get to talk is
in a different language (Which Leo has said it was tricky to learn the
language). DiCaprio has proved time and time again that he's more than
the pretty face actor, but in this movie I only saw Hugh Glass, not
DiCaprio. That's my biggest praise I have to give to Leo as he had to
deliver all the emotions, the pain, the tortured soul that Hugh Glass
was and it's all through his face and eyes, and trust me when I say
this but it's not easy as you think. We are so use to seeing Leo as the
angry, pretty boy billionaire in every movie he's in, but in this movie
I thought he was fantastic, as he played the man who lost everything
and the tortured soul that Hugh was as a person was. With very little
lines he had, he still manages to make a powerful performance that's so
far his best. I really hope Leo gets an Oscar for this.Tom Hardy also gave an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. I've
heard that some people had trouble understanding him in this movie (Or
just in everything that he's in really). Sometimes I didn't understand
what he said but most of the time I did. But all that a side, I still
think he was fantastic in the movie. He really added a lot to his
character, because sometimes you understand the things that he dose in
movie and yes the things he dose in the movie are wrong, but in a rough
environment that these people are in, you would likely do the same. I'm
not sure if he would get in for best supporting actor, but I hope he
dose.I'm running out of things to say about Emmanuel Lubezki breathtaking
cinematography. The camera work and how he makes the camera feel like a
character of it's own is seriously impressive. Lubezki captures nature
on film, that shows it's beauty and it's unpredictable surprises. The
people running the Oscars should just give Lubezki his third Oscar
right now, because he's going to take that third trophy home.Now for the flaws and there's not that many for me: Some of the
character logic towards the end of the movie didn't make that much
senses to me, and that's really it.Overall The Revenant is one of most intense, stunning, brutal movies
I've seen in 2015. The score is haunting, the editing was top notch and
that bear attack scene was just terrifying, I mean how the hell did
they do that?. I don't know about you, but I honestly can't stop
thinking about this movie. It's one of those movies that sticks with
you after it's over and it isn't going away anytime soon.

Review: The Revenant Film Viewed Date: 01.08.15 Review Date: 01.11.15To be honest I had mixed feelings walking in to this film. This is a
heavily hyped, publicized film in the man versus nature / survival
genre; a genre that takes a bit more determination to view, at least
for me. This film is living art celebrating the vastness and power of nature.
Nature is established as a rhythm from the start and continues
throughout the entire film, Nature provides a palpable heart beat in
every scene and if you concentrate, and consciously seek it out, it is
always there.Every scene change shows nature in a way that rarely witnessed by most:
blizzards, waterfalls, sparks dancing against a starry black canvas
captivates the audience over and over again. A heightened sense of
nature sets the stage to showcase a man pursuing redemption, driving to
fulfill is raison d'etre. Foreshadowing through symbolism pervades many scenes. The most
noteworthy for me was the dream sequence where DiCaprio's character
wanders through the ruin of a church with the bell in the bell tower
still intact swinging back and forth, ringing with a deafening silence
because the donger in the bell is missing. For whom does the bell toll
in this scene? Does the silence of the dongerless bell negate Donne's
prophetic warning? Even in a more sophomoric sense, the lack of the
bell donger portends the coming castration of a brutal Frenchman. In
another scene we find DiCaprio being born of a horseflesh vagina and
then tentatively stepping into the snowy path with a renewed purpose.
Although he has experienced rebirth, the beating heart of the natural
world continues unperturbed by the small affairs of people.DiCaprio is an incarnation of the will to survive in order to find
personal redemption as well as the respect of his slain wife. An
outstanding portrayal and one that will be discussed 50 years from now.
This performance just garnered a well deserved Golden Globe.Hardy cements his place as the most talented actor of our time. From
his trudging bow legged walk, to his vacant stares filled with the
spirit of animal survival. Hardy brilliantly renders a character who is
short on formal education, but long on primal instinct. He brilliantly
plays the dark to DiCaprio's light. Nature is beautiful and brutal. People are beautiful and savage. In
man's search for meaning, the great answer swirls somewhere in these
truths, but always hovering just out of reach. We can grasp for the
meaning of it all, but a true understanding must always be earned
through pain, blood and struggle as well as enduring love. This is not
a film of revenge, it is a film that tries to shed light on the meaning
of redemption and the reason we are all on this earth. It does not give
you the answer, but if you close your eyes and suspend your thinking in
the face of a strong north wind, you might just get a glimpse of it.

If you're thinking about watching this movie, be prepared. No
seriously, be really prepared, because it's one of the most intense and
unrelenting cinematic experiences of recent years. With stunning
cinematography and directing and a mesmerising performance by Leonardo
DiCaprio, coupled with intense gore and violence, The Revenant is an
amazingly engrossing film that, at times, left me jaw-dropped.Having said that, I wasn't immediately sold on The Revenant. Such is
the intensity and chaos of its action and cinematography, I began the
film thinking everything was a bit of a joke, and wasn't immediately
grabbed by the alleged intensity of the story. Even the already
infamous bear attack scene wasn't so astonishing, and for the first
half an hour or so, I was struggling to really get to grips with the
film, a feeling worsened by the fact that it seemed to all be moving
pretty slowly.However, everything changed at the focal point where Glass is left for
dead. From that moment on, I was absolutely astonished by the emotional
intensity of The Revenant, coupled with the extreme power of its gritty
visuals and action that ultimately lit the spark of what is an
absolutely enthralling film.Throughout, despite a lot of slow-moving long takes either establishing
the setting or Glass' gradual road to revenge, the film manages to do
the impossible, by making a slow-paced movie seem really fast. At
times, yes, The Revenant did drag, but for the most part, this didn't
feel at all like a two and a half hour long movie.That's largely down to the mind-blowing central performance given by
Leonardo DiCaprio. It's an extremely physical performance, given that
he has very little dialogue (most of which is in another language), but
what he manages to do so well is convey the emotional trauma through
just face expressions. Spending half the movie dragging himself across
the snowy forest floor, this is acting stripped down to its barest
bones, but in the end, it's a massively impressive and pretty unique
turn that definitely deserves some serious awards recognition.The other most outstanding aspect of the film is the astonishing
directing by Alejandro González Iñárritu. With the assistance of master
cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, it seems that Iñárritu has built on
his astonishing filmmaking techniques firmly established in Birdman,
and then some. The long takes, the natural lighting, the extreme
silence and the breathtaking landscape shots all come together to make
a visually spectacular movie that really grabs you right from the off.
Even if you're not so invested in the story, which can happen at brief
moments, the visuals will easily get you right back into this
intoxicating film.Overall, The Revenant is a fantastically gritty and intense thriller,
with stunning emotional resonance captured expertly by DiCaprio in the
lead role, and then firmly cemented by the incredible directing and
cinematography.

Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu swept the most prestigious awards in 2014
with "Birdman". He came back in 2015 with a totally different film,
which may (and should) give Leonardo Di Caprio a well-deserved Oscar
for Best Actor.The film's direction, cinematography and entire mise-en-scène are
absolutely magnificent and absorbing. It's a film depicting a
frightening scenery in Upper Midwestern United States (although it was
shot mainly in Canada) with the elements of nature (snow, wind,
waterfalls) playing a major part. And amidst this fascinating
background, an injured man left for dead (Di Caprio) fights nature, his
wounds, a tribe of Indians and many other obstacles to find the man who
killed his son and left him for dead (Tom Hardy) and take his revenge.It reminded me of many epic films of the past, especially ones when a
character left for dead seeks retribution, such as "Gladiator". The
film is an epic itself, and Di Caprio's performance is captivating,
especially if you take into account how much demanding such a part was.
Tom Hardy is also great as the cruel, sadistic, self-serving villain.
Some scenes, including the climactic final one, are full of suspense
and thrills.The film should be a contender for the Oscars, especially in the Best
Actor, Director, Cinematography and Sound categories. It was a film
difficult and expensive to shot, demanding for both the cast and the
crew. The only drawback is that it's a bit too long (150 mins), but in
the end it's all worth it.8-8,5/10

The Revenant from the trailers and promos seemed like DiCaprio's turn
in a beating-the-odds-survival story but that is not what this movie is
about. Rather, this is a very unique, gorgeously visceral exercise in
brutality. As usual DiCaprio gives another Oscar worthy performance (this might
finally be his year) and last year's Oscar winning director A. G.
Iñárritu is a solid director. The real winner in the movie is the
cinematography; which is absolutely fantastic. Tom Hardy along with the
rest of the cast also keep the intensity to the maximum. The only thing
that falls short is the thin plot and story line, with not much
substance there to work with and a slight lack of emotional depth
(sometimes the brutality seems like the means and the end with no point
to be found).Despite its shortcomings it is a must watch and one of the best movies
of the year.

Take one whole side of 'Inferno' (1953, Robert Ryan, Rhonda Fleming);
add two cups of 'Grizzly Man' (Werner Herzog) and one of ''Apocalypto';
a sprig of 'Into the Wild' and a dash of 'There will be Blood'; season
with a tablespoon of Tarantino. Let the whole mess half bake for 256
minutes at maximum carnage. The result is a film in which Iñarritù's
undeniable talent succumbs to the public's insatiable appetite for
screen violence for its own sake. James Bond on his best day could not
take the sadistic punishment meted out to Leonardo di Caprio in this
parable of 'vengeance is mine'. Somewhere along the line, amidst all
the gore, punctuated by delicate and sometimes mawkish moments of
dreamlike spirituality, the story loses sight of itself. Not to say
that the hundred million budget wasn't well spent. The opening battle
scene and the near-fatal encounter, early on, are superbly done. Some
of the best CGI I've ever seen put to good use. Worth the price of the
ticket just to see these two sequences. Otherwise, Iñarritù should get
back to what he does best: shooting a tight screenplay with great
acting and less grand philosophizing about nature.

It's a heart-bleeding thriller about love and forgiveness. Adapted by
Inarritu from a novel by Michael Punke, the film is loosely based on a
real incident from 1823. Inarritu's stylistic gifts embraces the
audience to tag along with the protagonist without blinking for 156
minutes. The boundary-pusher director insisted on filming with natural
daylights which made panoramic long shots look absolutely stunning. The close-ups of the cast are often shot at an interestingly low angle,
showing right through the character's eyes in moments of high drama,
Lubezki even allows their breath to fog the lens. He repeated his
uncanny vision through the lens which took me back to 'The Tree of
Life' era where we told a story through lights and colors. Last but not
least is the DiCaprio/Hardy duel has pushed Leo's craft to the kind of
physical and psychological extremes that a younger performer would not
never concern himself with. Right picks for the right genre I'd call
it.All and all the entire package has made this movie a visceral
sensation, filled with blood yet tender make the project brilliant and
vibrant and an excuse to reminded us to be more forgiving  to love and
to be loved.

The biggest distinction between older westerns (made before the 1970s)
and the more current ones is how they portray the atmosphere. Both
establish well enough that it was an unforgiving environment, but there
is something safer about the older ones; an idea that you could at
least get a drink from the saloon without a chance of getting shot. Now
of course, we know that even a walk down main street was never a
guarantee as there were a lot of deaths due to idiots with guns or
greedy individuals who have surrendered their humanity in order to
survive. We're lucky that we live in such a time period where we've found
treatments for so many injuries and diseases that the lifespan has spun
out of control. Back when even reaching sixty was a stretch is becoming
more of the common middle ground. Back then, if you were lucky enough
to make it through the madness that was the "survival of the fittest
attitude", you still had to last through horrible diseases, attacks
from unfriendly Native Americans, and of course, the forces of natures.
The story of one frontiersman and his trek through the wilderness shows
no mercy in The Revenant.In the early days of conquering the west in 1832, a military party of
hunters and trappers are ambushed by the Arikara tribe. The attack
leads to two thirds dead and the escaped survivors weary and trying to
make their way back to civilization. Under the command of Captain
Andrew Henry, it's agreed by fur trapper Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo
DiCaprio) to ditch their only boat to hike the rest of the way, in
order to avoid any more Indian attacks. Glass gets mauled by a mother
grizzly bear and is wounded to the point where the rest of his party is
convinced that he's going to die.Two men stay behind in order to wait for Glass to die so they can give
him a proper burial, John Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and Jim
Bridger (played by Will Poulter). Fitzgerald grows impatient and
convinces Bridger to leave Glass behind so they can get to a nearby
fort sooner for warmth and food. Even with the broken leg, broken ribs,
and exposed wounds from the bear attack, Glass regains conciseness and
proceeds to head in the direction that Fitzgerald was going to get his
revenge for leaving him behind. Glass faces cold temperatures, his own
wounds, and still hostile Indians in order to get to safety.Directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu (Birdman), then you'll see that not
only did he create a dark western, but wanted to make sure his actors
would understand how harsh the environment was. The Revenant is self
aware of how uncomfortable and gritty it is (even more so then The
Hateful Eight) as is Leonardo DiCaprio who is the one to suffer the
most. He gives everything he has for this nearly silent (yet still
speaking two Native American languages) frontiersman who goes through
hell, literally and figuratively, for the performance that looked to be
so hard, that if he doesn't finally get an Oscar, is clear proof that
the academy hates him for no real reason.Tom Hardy and Will Poulter manage to stand out in their own scenes,
even knowing that there's no way they could have outshined DiCaprio. The Revenant makes for a very interesting journey that unfortunately is
plagued by it's own tone. Since were following one guy's journey home,
the two and a half hour running time is a lot to ask of it's audience.
It worked better for Cast Away as the environment constantly changed,
while we're stuck in this grim, snowy setting the entire time. I'll give this eight bear skins out of ten. Aside from being the major
justification to finally let Leonardo DiCaprio, The Revenant happens to
be a pretty good journey into the harsh west. It's understandably not
for everyone, but if your can stomach the worst from animal guts and
broken bones, then this journey into hell is an interesting one.

If the rumblings from director Alexander Gonzalez Inarritu and his
intrepid cast and crew about The Revenant being the most tumultuous,
challenging shoot of their lives are true, it's all in service of the
loftiest of causes one could achieve: to produce great art. I say that
without pretension or monocle wagging patronization, and mark my words:
The Revenant is by and far the greatest film this year, and possibly of
the last decade. It is monumental in scale, meticulous in pacing and
erects the fundamental pillars of the human condition so flawlessly
that we feel we are watching actual history materialize before our
eyes, untethered from the notion that it's just a movie. Let's start with the ocular deity that is Emmanuel Lubezki: This film
contains the best cinematography I have ever seen in my life. The bold
location scouting is a catalyst for the prodigy of a DOP to work his
ethereal magic. Time and time again throughout the film I found myself
marvelling at the stunning patience and skill displayed by the man in
attaining his precious shots, constantly chafed by what I imagine was
an impossibly stressful environment, bogged down by time constraints
and the pure, uncaring call of nature itself. He shot with natural
light for all but one scene, an unimaginable achievement that plays out
in endless beauty that rocks your soul to its foundation for the entire
two and a half hour running time. The locations, lovingly culled from
deep within northern Canada and briefly Argentina, are an unforgiving
cacophony of serene snowfalls, cascading rivers and jagged, untamed
mountain ranges. This is the landscape I have grown up in no call home
and to such holy places captured with such reverence on film, gilding a
story of such primordial importance had me next to tears. Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out all the stops in his ferocious portrayal of
Hugh Glass, a frontiersman who lives by his feral gut instinct alone,
attempting to guide his fur trapping expedition through the terrain
while looking out for his half Pawnee Native son who he already rescued
from aching tragedy years before. After a harrowing raid in the dawning
minutes of the film that makes it abundantly clear how serious thee
film intends to be, he and a small band of men are stranded and forced
to contend with the land, and the threat of the natives finding them.
Glass then gets attacked by a bear in a nerve shattering sequence that
had my adrenal glands running a marathon. The frank, unapologetic
nature in which the scene plays out reminds us all that nature isn't
our playground of opportunity and commerce, but a living organism that
can bite the hand that it refuses to feed with alarming abandon. The
sheer level of carnage inflicted upon Glass by both beast and man will
shake you to your core, as will the excellent makeup and CGI effects
that drive the point deep into your retinas. Tom Hardy disappears into
his role better than Glass's expedition blends into the treacherous
blizzards, playing John Fitzgerald, a cowardly creature who is content
to leave Glass to the elements and seek fortune elsewhere, dragging
sympathetic Jim Bridger (Will Poulter, excellent) along with him. The
military component of their expedition (Domhall Gleeson, superb)
suspects Fitzgerald and is wary. Hardy is the very definition of an
acting chameleon, and disappears headlong into the role that had me
riveted, and rooting for a best supporting actor win. The entire cast
was subjected to a brutal nine weeks exposed to the elements, each
other, and the raw, archetypal narrative of the piece that was being
made, and each of them shows it in spades. At its core it's a revenge piece, spurred by aching character
interaction involving Leo,and his family in affecting flashbacks. Leo
goes through somewhat of a transformation here.. He loses all he has
left to an uncaring, cold faced world that would sooner see him tossed
around a mosses stained forest in pieces than avenged. But his Hugh
Glass rages against the dying of the light right alongside Lubezki's
lens, creating in tandem the perfect voyage of a man who has become so
consumed with the forces of nature in his quest to attain some
semblance of his former self, that he has become somewhat of an element
himself. Leo truly deserves gold this time around. Adventure/survival epics are my favourite. This one stands out, and
yet.. does more than that, if possible. It delves deep into the lush,
echoing vastness of the past and pulls forth a story so human, so
recognizable, in such a force of construction where the fruits of
everyone's labour are so obvious, it can't help but be worshipped as a
classic in the art form of cinema and a treatise on how to excel in
every single area of the medium.

Fur trappers attacked at a river. Survivors escape. Extreme cold
winters. Barely surviving. Mr. Glass (Mr Smith) survives a grizzly bear
attack. His injuries are life threatening,with half his face, ear, and
scalp stitched back as good as can be by the only willing associate.
I'm surprised nobody else has noticed these similarities. This is not
actually a review. It is just an observation. I get my facts from a
documentary entitled, Taming the Wild West: The Legend of Jedediah
Smith. It is very compelling story about an extremely brave and
talented pioneer in the history of the wild west. I recommend watching
the documentary as well as this movie. The documentary is actually more
entertaining.

Several things made this movie amazing, the demonstration of human
resilience, the stunning visuals and the outstanding cast. Despite the
minimal use of Leonardo's verbal acting, his ability to display the
character's sheer emotions in every aspect was both invigorating and
powerful. With every new challenge came the display of pure will power;
understanding survival in the truest sense in a way which really
transcended with me and I'm sure with many other viewers of the film.
Another aspect of the movie I loved was the beauty within the film -
the vibrancy of the locations really added that extra "punch."Although it had its captivating scenes whereas I would certainly place
one in particular for "scene of the year" contention, the movie
developed slowly with less human interactions than expected. I would
relate it to other adventure movies like 'Wild' or '127 Hours'... as
the movie did not wrap around vengeance and fighting like I
anticipated.

this was a terrible movie the best part was when the bear kicked his
butt should have ended after round 2.I don't understand how you guys
can watch gravity this and interstellar and honestly give 8's 9's and
10 ratings?!Please someone tell me where is this movie an 8.3 out of 10
it was boring the only thing that happened in the 1st hour is the
Indians attack because a white guy took the chiefs daughter the white
men are hateful toward the young Indian guy that was raised by the guy
because back then white men were just racist because everyone isn't
white they treated the guys son like crap and then the guy gets his ass
kicked by a bear best part of movie and then has to fight to stay alive

After winning the Oscar for Birdman last year, Alejandro González
Iñárritu takes the viewers into a much different setting with The
Revenant. The Revenant is the story of Hugh Glass, remarkably portrayed
by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is left for dead by his fellow fur- trappers
after he encounters a bear which terrifyingly mauls him. The scene is
undoubtedly one of the boldest, gut-wrenching and wonderfully captured
scene the Hollywood has ever done.There is also a sub-plot here, which shines light on the Natives
(Arikara) about how they once held all of America and are now just an
endangered species on the brink of extinction as one of the natives
says in the film : "You all have stolen everything from us. The land,
the animals."One of the recurring theme in the movie is that how the elder member
does whatever he can to protect his family. This theme is not only
restricted to humans, but also to the animals which is understood when
the bear slashes Glass in an attempt to protect her cubs. The skulls of
the bulls, which appear many times in Glass' visions, symbolize the
same theme. Bull or bison, is mostly referred in Native Indian
traditions to a strong,powerful animal which never backs down from a
struggle and always strives to protect it's family. Tom Hardy plays a brilliant villain, who though isn't always wrong, but
has little to none redeeming qualities making him a cold- hearted,
harsh and an uncompromising villain. The rest of the crew don't have
major involvement in the plot but play their roles perfectly. The aspect of the movie that excels and stands out most is its
beautiful cinematography. Emmanuel Lubezki has once again done an
incredible job capturing beautiful imagery and landscapes completely
immersing the viewer in the setting. I could feel every cold breeze as
it passed, every splash of water and an overwhelming feeling after
looking at the beauty of nature.In conclusion, The Revenant is a pulse pounding,absorbing and visceral
journey which perfectly captures the time period and the setting. It is
a pure survival story providing a simple plot which is perfectly
executed with every actor playing their roles perfectly so viewers can
connect to them and every shot is gorgeous enough to move the viewer
inside and keep him seated for this incredibly epic and mesmerizing
journey. The Revenant deserves a 9/10.

Alejandro González Iñárritu is solidifying himself as one of the finest
directors of his era. He has directed two aesthetically beauteous
chefs-d'oeuvres in just a two-year span. The first was the 215 Oscar
winner for best picture, Birdman, and now the The Revenant  another
Oscar worthy movie. The Revenant is straightforward from a story perspective. The story is
about a protagonist seeking revenge on an antagonist for his
malevolent, self-indulgent and inhumane actions. However, Iñárritu
evinces the story you tell does not matter. What matters is how you
tell it. The story is brilliantly structured. Every scene amplified the
suspense and intensity of the movie, and it was sprinkled with just
enough plot twists to keep us guesstimating how it would all unravel.
It was difficult to guess how it would end, yet the journey of how the
character would will himself to get there and how the climax would play
out made the movie keep its vigorousness. Behind the disheartening tone
constantly following around the characters, is an inspirational story.
A story that demonstrates how much drive and perseverance we as humans
have. All we have to do is dig deep to discover it, and if we do it can
make us dangerous beyond belief.The directing, however, is what makes this movie stand out the most. It
is so natural and so realistic that it blurs the line between reality
and fiction. It is almost as you are in a virtual ride or playing a
video game as the protagonist, feeling every inner-emotion the
protagonist feels.The Revenant takes its audience on an aesthetically stunning expedition
with meticulously remarkable directing; beauteous cinematography;
thought-provoking, ultra-philosophical and metaphorical dialogue; and
an exquisite, way-too-realistic method acting-esque performance by
Leonardo DiCaprio.

****May contain strong spoilers****As this movie is very different from almost everything else that is
done today, it was an experience to watch it. The vast nature environment, the grueling story and the truth from the age of time makes this piece a spectacular one. Great acting, great script, great director and a splendid production blends together to make the movie and the experience a magnificent one. The violence in this movie is both haunting and realistic. Remember....it's in the beginning of the 19th century. As the story
goes the picture also has some spiritual and soul searching aspects. I my own opinion, I have to say that people
that claims that this movie is just waste of time and boring....sadly, they are missing the point and lacking the way of enjoying art.On the other perspective; If you want action, explosions, sex and
"Hollywood-where-is-the-reality" type of movie with fast pace and impulsive rounds of shotguns....well.... this movie can be rejected.
So...I can grasp where the negativity for the movie comes from.In my perspective; let this one take hold of you and make the
mindfulness fill you. We have so much to learn about love and caring for one another.8,0 out of 10

This skyrocketed straight into my top 3 movies of the year and was a
great experience all around.First of this was a great story dealing with a survival story fueled on
revenge when a personal injustice occurs. The set pieces look amazing
but also gives you a good picture on how cold and desolate this place
really is that there all struggling thru.It goes from bad to worse when the main character gets attacked by a
bear and is severely wounded by that. While to sick to move he
witnesses his son getting killed over racial differences and he himself
is left for death.Barely recovered he goes after the killer and will do anything to
survive so he can avenge his son's death. Writing it down like this it
seems very "black and white" but there are a lot of Grey areas but they
are more subtle like in facial expressions or things not said.I got in to the movie pretty fast and was somewhat surprised it has a 2
and a half hour running time because the time just flew by.Highly recommend it.If you haven't seen it,go watch it now.An awesome western/adventure.

This movie is beautiful with that kind of creepy beauty you'll find in
Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" or Greenaway's "The Pillow Book". Though
it's spoiled with preachy sentiments it will still envelop you and
carry away into the straight-out wilderness that long gone now. This
movie is not about "action", but about one man's journey, about revenge
and justice. In "The Revenant" you'll see magnificent vistas and
blatant brutality, cowardliness and courage, vileness and generosity.
Rare artwork in now day's cinematography which is actually art and not
your typical blockbuster junk movie. It's European film in the essence
with Hollywood's scale and budget.

So great movies this year, but only a few were phenomenal, and one of
the phenomenal film of this year is "The Revenant" , directed by
Alejandro González Inarritu. The plot of this movie is very simple: A
man is left for dead by two people and one of them killed his child,
and this man, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is going for revenge. When
the film starts, I knew this movie will be great. I was right. The
acting is incredible, with a powerful performance by Leonardo DiCaprio,
probably is going to win the Oscar for this performance, a perfect
acting by DiCaprio, who suffers very much for this role but it worth
it, because I was incredible fascinating by this performance. Tom Hardy
is also very good, one of the best role of his entire career, and he
deserves to be nominated for best supporting actor. The image of this
movie is incredible,is amazing, because this movie was filmed only with
natural lights, the fire, the sun, the moon, incredible achievement.
This movie look so real, that when the main character is in the cold
water, is like you are in there and this blew me away and this
cinematography by Emmanuel Lubeski is one of the best that I've seen.
In this movie is a scene, involving a bear, that almost killed the main
character, and I was asking myself:"how they do that", because it was
so tense, so incredible, is one of the best scene that I've seen this
year, an amazing scene, shot beautifully. The star of this film is
Alejandro G.Inarritu, who directed this film with passion, with beauty,
is a Oscar-worthy, and I think that he is going to win again for best
director. "The Revenant" is a brutal, violent and rough movie, but also
is beautiful, the views are breath-taking, with powerful performances
and superb directing, a Oscar-worthy for Best Picture of The Year and
my favourite movie of 2015.

Firstly I will get this right of the bat.Much has been made about Leo
deserving Oscar for this movie after loosing multiple times. My review
will Strictly contain details of movie and final opinion on Leo Oscar
situation.I know people struggled to make this movie.Icy mountains,Cold
weather,Natural light etc.In all the award show interviews Leo keeps
saying this is his toughest role ever.After watching the movie I have to say I was disappointed.Remember the
first shot of the trailer with Leo in front of the mountain?Over heard
voice says "I am not afraid to die anymore,I have done it already".Well
this movie miserably failed to convince us with the second part of the
sentence.Script,Direction and acting all failed.Script was half
baked.Acting was overdone and direction was all over the place.Plot is basic revenge.But they made it Oscar bait.A man left behind to
die seeks revenge on those who betrayed him is pretty cool plot. But
the movie fails to make us feel the lead's struggle.Hugh glass(Leo) is mauled by bear (which by the way is an awesome
visual effect achievement) and since he becomes a dead weight the team
decides to wait till he dies and then bury him.John Fitzgerald (Hardy)
is this "Evil" guy (and is too on the nose and no subtlety).John tries
to kill Glass so they can move on quickly.In the process he kills
Glass's son who obstructs them. John buries Glass alive and
leaves.Glass crawls from grave and makes his way back to their camp and
takes the help of their boss to track and kill on the run John.Having given the plot.The -ve points are1) After attacked by bear glass needs to struggle more (at-least make
us feel he struggled more time).After gruesome attack crawling itself
felt far fetched let alone seeing him sitting and moving hands
normally. Strangely the sequences does not have much impact after bear
attack.2) His will to survive is just superficial and is shown by Leo grunting
and making angry pain faces and nothing special there.We don't feel
this man's pain having lost his son. Man this shows what an actor
Russell Crowe was in gladiator.I mean WOW. Russell Crowe made us care
and at last cry for him in gladiator.3)Glass seems to be having wolverine genes.His healing rate and rebound
rate is just supernatural.Falling of cliff unharmed or mauled by bear
and fully functioning after couple of days just sucks you out of the
movie.4)Bland characters and many are one dimensional.Cheesy acting.5)Pay off is white knuckle but you don't feel the satisfaction of
reaching there.The so-called twists in last 10 minutes are just too
predictable. Acting like dead body on horse to ambush john or help from
Indian girl he saves earlier are just OK.6)Continuing parallel story lines between glass avenging his sons death
and an Indian searching for his daughter are just pretentious.So the bottom line is THERE IS NO REAL EMOTIONAL CORE TO THIS MOVIE.It's just a bunch of gruesome scenes that shows how bad it was in that
time period. That's all. You are just a spectator and never feel for the character.Oscar Leo:This is the tricky part which will make fans of Leo angry.But I will be
honest.It felt super Oscar bait.Tagging his son's death which wasn't in the
novel felt forced.GRUNTING AND SCREAMING AND MAKING ANGRY FACES doesn't
mean great acting.So I give 6/10.

Recipe for a hit movie nowadays:1) make it long, no shorter than 2.30 hours 2) put some philosophy and
self-criticism in it 3) make it so serious that not even a single
laughter or joke is heard 4) compose depressive soundtrackI am giving 5 stars for successfully and realistically shot scenes,
that's it. Attack of the bear looks so real as well as the fight
scenes.Plot is so simple and static that what receives your attention most
becomes never-ending and boring winter scenes and you literally get
cold seeing them on snow for 2,5 hours.Despite visual success, another pointless movie from the director and
leonardo.

The story of Hugh Glass was quite astonishing but the Leo version
managed to turn this true story of survival into a daft revenge flick.
The scenery was quite breath-taking but the acting was far from that.
Based on a true story but with practically every scene made up
nonsense.Making Fitzgerald kill his imaginary son to set up the revenge element
Glass then walks through a boring sub-plot about some Indian looking
for his daughter before gaining said revenge.The reality was so much more interesting but sadly reality is a word
Hollywood has never heard of. So we get a poorly executed revenge
scenario culminating in a big fight which ties up the two plots in a
bow for the audience.Hugh Glass had a really interesting life and his walk to safety would
have been really inspirational to those that heard about it. The film
of his 'life' sadly was pretty boring and dragged on and on for well
over an hour too much. Leo is a great actor and played his part well
enough but the tale was poorly served by those involved in the movie
production. Another disappointing film that promised so much.

Don't waste your time or money. The trailer is the best part of movie,
this has to be the worst movie ever made in the history of filmmaking.
Everyone says how visually stunning it is, what about the actual movie,
oh wait there wasn't one. This movie actually put me to sleep within
the first 30 min, absolutely horrible, and i can't stress enough how
horrible this P.O.S. is. We need to collectively quit going to see
these pieces of crap that are nominated for Oscars before they even
come out. 9 times out of 10 they stink. But this little gem of a highly
polished turd takes the cake. Stop it Hollywood just stop it PLEASE! So
to review, Leo can't get an Oscar if he only talks for seriously maybe
20 min in entire movie and the visual effects are not the best ever as
predicted again in the overrated preview trailers. So if you want to
waste a good chunk of your day approx 2hrs. 40min to be precise go see
it. If you want to waste the gas in your vehicle to drive to theater
and then spend your hard earned $ on a ticket and probably buy
overpriced food and drinks and not to mention fight with the crowds
that were all fooled into watching this completely worthless movie go
ahead, but you' ve been warned...

Greetings again from the darkness. "Keep breathing." A flashback in the
opening sequence has Hugh Glass whispering the phrase as advice to his
young son Hawk, the product of Glass and his beloved Pawnee bride. The
phrase has a recurring role throughout the film  possibly serving as a
courtesy reminder from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu to the
moviegoers mesmerized (and nearly traumatized) by the incredible
brutality of what is on screen.It's a master class in filmmaking by those at the top of their game.
Inarritu is the reigning Oscar winning director for Birdman or (The
Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), and he has re-teamed with the reigning
Oscar winning cinematographer from that movie, Emmanuel Lubezki. Two of
the finest actors of their generation, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy,
strip away any semblance of pampered movie stardom to deliver
ultra-realistic performances in a story "based in part" on the true to
life novel by Michael Punke.An early action sequence is startling in its ferocity as Arikara
surround and attack a group of hunters and trappers, and the whoosh of
arrows  many of which find their mark  abruptly drag us into a world
that we are unfamiliar with and certainly unprepared for. It's early
19th century U.S. frontier, and just about everyone and everything can
kill you. Providing just enough time for us to pry our fingers off the
armrests, Inarritu stuns us with what is undoubtedly the most fantastic
grizzly bear attack on a movie star ever filmed. In what appears to be
a single take (which also happens to be the number of breaths I took),
Mama Grizzly treats Leonardo the way a young puppy treats its first
chew toy. Scratched, chewed, tossed and stomped. This scene is savage
and brutal, and sets the stage for the true, yet still unbelievable
odyssey of survival by frontiersman Hugh Glass.Tom Hardy excels as the calmly psychotic villain Fitzgerald, though
some of his early hillbilly-tinged dialogue is difficult to catch. His
hulking presence fits with our imagined look of the frontiersman of the
era  tough and unforgiving nearly beyond belief. His bullying of
youngster Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter) and power struggles with
Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) are at frightening levels of
intensity. Fans of Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds will smile as they
recognize the name of mountain man Jim Bridger  though that's one of
the few smiles offered by this 156 minute gut-wrenching ordeal. It
would not be surprising if DiCaprio's mantel sports an Oscar in a few
months. He is that superb in a role that has nothing to do with good
looks or charm.A tale of survival. A quest for revenge. It's both of those, as well as
a reminder that nature can be both beautiful and brutal. Some of the
photography is almost poetic, and often reminds of the work of director
Terrence Malick. And in the blink of an eye, that moment is shattered
by the torrential force of river rapids carrying Glass over the
waterfall, or his taking a horseback ride off a steep cliff (one of the
most dramatic shots of the film). The journey of Glass is unknown in
distance or time in the movie, but there is no question as to the
numerous struggles with the elements and the raw physicality required
to persevere. If you can avoid diverting your eyes, there are visuals
here that will be sincerely appreciated  even as you squirm, cringe
and moan throughout.From a technical standpoint, the film was shot on location in Canada
and Argentina using only natural lighting, and emphasizing aspects of
nature that often are overlooked. The sound of arrows, bears, and even
DiCaprio's breathing are profound and crucial to the overall effect, as
are the animal skin garments and other costumes. It's impossible to
tell where CGI meets reality, but the visceral experience will be quite
unique for most viewers  and not soon forgotten.

So my idea of a good movie is quite simple,- I'm just asking myself,
whether I'm willing to watch it again or not. And, boy oh boy, this
movie fails this subjective 'test'! Yeah, the film is visually great -
it's Iñárritu at its best and all that stuff. But it feels more like a
kaleidoscope of beautiful imagery with no emotional or intellectual
filling. Of course, there are the hackneyed 'bear' and 'horse' scenes,
but all in all, there is nothing to feel or worry about. To get a
general feeling for the Revenant, just read through its 'Quotes' (which
are accessible from the main page),- this is almost all the dialogue
you hear in the entire movie. Very 'fascinating' indeed... And for all
of you, who love and hype this movie so much,- I dare you to watch it
again... today... Lets see how reluctant are you gonna be to do so!? I
liked 'The H8ful eight' way, way better! In fact, once I finished
watching it, I almost immediately started to replay my favorite scenes
from the movie, - because they were so powerfully delivered. So in this
Christmas snowstorm showdown between Tarantino and Iñárritu, the
hands-down winner is, undoubtedly, Mr. QT.

Alejandro González Iñárritu + Leonardo DiCaprio = A Bloody Hell Movie
Called The Revenant; literally blood everywhere. What I like about this
movie was the director (Alejandro Iñárritu) shot techniques. I don't
know what they call it, I have to research on that one. But its pretty
amazing! If you have been watching Iñárritu's films such as Babel,
Biutiful, Birdman and The Revenant, you will know what I mean. It's
like a one-take shot of 20-30minutes scene and its really cool. I think
that's Iñárritu's trademark. Every time I see that kind of shot
technique I know for sure its Alejandro G. Iñárritu films. 2 Thumbs Up
to Leo's performance, he's always been a great actor.

The Revenant is a film that works on a plethora of levels. It follows a
fairly basic storyline that the average moviegoer could wholly
understand. However, there is much more looming within the incredibly
imagery and filmmaking of the Revenant than one might assume. The
Revenant is not a film with a clear message, but instead one with many,
small hints as to what the underlying implications are. Alejandro G.
Innaritu's directorial style and choices shine through this film,
creating a visceral and aesthetic yin and yang as we watch the gorgeous
and gentle landscapes and scenery meld with the brutal, harsh storyline
and occurrences. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Hugh Glass is one
of little dialogue, but large impact, and may win him an Oscar this
year. Tom Hardy's performance as John Fitzgerald is one that is
possibly more exemplary than Dicaprio's, although that's up for debate.
Although parts of this film are slightly too long winded or slow,
overall it is a film that's imagery and story will resonate with the
viewer long after watching it, and truly pays homage to the art of
filmmaking.

Many films excited me towards the end of 2015 such as Star Wars VII,
Spectre, The Hateful Eight but I must be honest I was most excited to
see The Revenant. The movie follows a simple revenge/survival story
with Leonardo DiCaprio being the focal point of it after being left for
dead by his crew in the wilderness.From watching the teaser trailer
last year, I could already tell that it would be visually stunning but
after watching it I have concluded that it is more than visually
stunning it is a visual achievement, there are scenes that will shock
you and make yourself wonder how it was shot. There are many scenes in
the movie that are shot in a "Birdman" fashion with the slow tracking
shots with long takes however it never feels like Innaritu is milking
on Birdman's visual success. The movie also looks very realistic in
showcasing the grit and filth of being a frontiersman. The acting in
this movie is also very good and DiCaprio puts on a very captivating
performance which could very likely win him an Oscar. I feel as though
Tom Hardy should also be recognized for his performance as he was
excellent as well. However amidst all this praise I cannot help but
feel as though the film has flaws. I feel as though the plot is very
simple in essence and is just how DiCaprio's character survives and how
he obtains vengeance. However I never feel as though the moral Innaritu
was trying to portray at moments in the movie is fully expressed. It
was almost like the film was going to go in a more morally conscious
direction but was changed. However the movie is still one of the best I
have seen in 2015 and is sure to win many awards. Go see it!8.5/10

Backing up from last year's Oscar winning Birdman was always going to
be challenging for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, but he's
unleashed an almighty wallop of a film that surpasses his previous
effort in every way. Tracking 1820's frontiersman Hugh Glass as he
endeavours to survive against inhospitable natural elements, merciless
Indians and treacherous allies, this intense saga explores how strong
the human spirit can be, even in the face of certain death. It's not an
easy viewing experience, with Iñárritu displaying Glass' compounding
problems in lengthy, uncomfortable sequences that prioritise grim
reality  in all its brutal detail  over a more palatable form of
entertainment. It's a bold choice, but one that ultimately pays off;
the meticulous visual presentation and stunning cinematography
combining with the immersive sound design to create a raw adventure
that is both horrific and beautiful. Iñárritu's persistence with long,
unbroken tracking shots continues on from Birdman, however he has taken
it up a notch here, capturing whole sequences  including a vicious
bear attack and the heart-pounding opening battle  with jaw-dropping
ingenuity. Portrayed with poignancy by Leonardo DiCaprio, Glass is a
stoic survivor who pushes through his physical struggles and emotional
turmoil with gritty determination and powerful inner strength. Golden
Globe down, Oscar to go. For those willing to spend two and a half
hours in the harsh wilderness on a ferocious journey, both physically
and mentally, The Revenant is a deeply evocative and rewarding
experience.

It has been many years since such a beautiful movie came out. One that
you remember years after watching it, and want to see it again with
every occasion.The Revenant is majestic in all aspects. The directing and
cinematography are simply breathtaking, with dynamic takes that last 2-
3 minutes, it is like nothing I have seen before. Cast and acting is
world class, seeing DiCaprio and Hardy so closely together in raw
conflict is truly impressive - these two are the next titans of the big
screen.I would put this masterpiece of a movie on everyone's must watch list.

I'm not really sure I can add more to the reviews here than what's
already been submitted, but here goes.This is a once-in-a-decade movie, it's incredibly good. Everything from
the direction to the awesome, harsh, beautiful and unforgiving scenery,
script and to the overall acting is fantastic, and DiCaprio's
performance is beyond flawless. A clear 10/10. DiCaprio needs a
retroactive shower of Oscars, and this movie should be his crowning
jewel. A slight warning to those who cannot keep up with deeper movies where
nothing continuously explodes, and there's no half-porn blonde chick
with big tits running around topless licking Jason Statham's bald head
while he shoots people; this movie isn't for your shallow minds. Go
squeeze some popcorn and watch something simple instead.But to every one else with active minds; watch this movie, you won't
regret it. Awesome to say the least.

I loved 2014's Birdman and I am a fan of Alejandro G. Innaritu. But if
Birdman to me, was a masterpiece that followed the human condition of
the sanity between three characters, Innaritu once again delivers that
accomplishment that worked for Birdman and that works for three great
characters with this survival tale that is The Revenant.Leonardo DiCaprio kills it in his role of Hugh Glass. He doesn't have a
lot of lines in the film, but whenever he is on screen, he delivered. I
was wondering, well a survival role, can he pull it off, and it turns
out to my surprise, he succeeded. I recognized Leonardo as the
character he was playing and not as himself in that role, and that's
why I think that this time, he should get his long overdue Academy
Award.The rest of the cast were great too, Tom Hardy, Will Poulter, Domhnall
Gleeson all of them delivered. The Revenant was gritty, realistic, very
manly and beautifully powerful with pulse pounding tension and a score
that is haunting and dazzling.10/10

The movie is based on a vengeance,survival-themed plot. Despite
this,the vengeance part comes all out at the end of the movie. With
this said, throughout the movie Leonardo DiCaprio tries to heal from
the bear mauling and to survive the extreme cold weather. The visuals are great as well as the cinematography. I recommend that
if you were to watch this movie , watch it on a big screen with HD
screening because you'll enjoy it even more (because of the visuals).Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite actor and undoubtedly his performance
is outstanding. Tom Hardy's performance is simply indescribable, his
excellent performance deserves recognition and is to be admired. The movie is a slow movie, which is why you need patience watching
Leonardo DiCaprio cling for his life. I honestly expected much of this
movie and for some reason i felt a little disappointed at the end. If
you do not like survival-themed movies I recommend to not watch The
Revenant because in my opinion that is what the movie is all about.

This is my first review and i'm not that eloquent with English words,
so i keep it short and simple."Son of Murphy's Law" kept slipping from one crap to the next, *to the
next (*keep repeating from here) and survived somehow every time! I'm
not sure about if one should call that luck or the exact opposite? ;DSuspension of disbelief is strongly recommended, but above that, it was
an very entertaining film and worth the money you pay for! Both performances, from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, were
brilliant.Somehow i had forgotten (don't ask) that Tom Hardy was one of the main
characters in this movie and i didn't even recognize him in the whole
first hour! *blush* His accent and the dialect he had spoken, were so
different than that what i knew from him ... - for me, as
non-native-English-speaker, the "cowboy-slang" was perfect. :)

Every once in a while (about twice per decade, at best, I'd suggest) a
film comes along that within the first few minutes you're thinking to
yourself "I don't want this to end ..." and this is one of those
oh-so-rare productions - absolutely magnificent in every respect.It will for sure be a love/hate film for the wider audience (this most
certainly ain't a rom-com girls so ...) and the stupids will doubtless
be very, very bored after the first half an hour but if you like
"proper" films and appreciate cinematography and top-notch acting in a
gritty and (very) grim context then this is for you.As the other guy suggests - stop reading this, go put your hand in your
pockets and pay to go see it where it should be seen on a big screen at
the cinema; this is one of those twice-per-decade films that *must* be
seen that way ...Big respect and thanks go to all concerned with making this cinematic
triumph.

StoryThe Revenant is a simple revenge drama. It is inspired by the book, of
the same name, written by Michael Punk, which was inspired by the life
of Hugh Glass, a fur trapper who is motivated not by revenge, as
depicted in this movie, but, simply by a desire to get his furs back.But, revenge makes for a more engaging movie, or so the team that
created this movie must have thought. ActingLet's first address the most important reason why this movie has been
on the watchlist of the majority of the people, including me, an
admirer of Leonardo DiCaprio. This is supposed to be the film that
finally gets him the elusive and his first Academy Award. Like most of
his movies, Leo does deliver an intense performance. Looking at it as
an "individual performance" it is clearly visible that he has given it
his all and put in a lot of effort, like he always does. His
performance is mainly physical, as he mouths only a few dialogues, most
of which are in a tribal language. Eats raw bison liver and sleeps
inside an animal carcass. Such acts, require determination, not acting
skills. If any other actor was to play this role, then even he would
have done so. Taking all this into account, I feel that this
performance is behind many of his previous and more Oscar-deserving
roles. The main reason behind this is that, when you compare it to
those previous ones, it becomes abundantly clear, that this performance
is like a collage of some of his previous ones. From an acting point of
view, he has never experimented a lot and his always restricted himself
to a particular kind of serious roles, which he has undoubtedly
excelled at. But , he has hardly ever done anything innovative.
Unfortunately, he does the same, in this movie too and this year with
other brilliant performances in the mix, Leo's performance, doesn't
seem like a front-runner, who deserves to win, now.The star for me was, Tom Hardy, as Glass'comrade, John Fitzgerald, who
leaves him for dead, kills his half-Indian son, and robs him of his
furs. He is the most gifted actor of his generation and he puts his
acting skills on display, yet again.He perfects his western accent. He
beautifully expresses his character's varying feelings, from the
bottled frustration of staying back to look after a nearly-dead Glass;
to the shock and pain of realizing when he accidentally kills Glass'
son; to the feeling of paranoia of being caught for his deeds; Hardy
carries himself with authority and dominates which ever scene he is in.
It is unfortunate, that he is not getting as much praise as Leo, when
he truly deserves more.Cinematography & Background ScoreA third consecutive Oscar nomination for cinematographer Emmanuel
Lubezki who films in such exotic areas as Chile's Tierra del Fuego and
also parts of Alberta, British Columbia and Montana, seems imminent. He
also deserves to win it.It is one of the 2 reasons, that raises the
level of the movie and makes it a must watch on the big screen. Those
beautiful mountains and gleaming rivers in the sunlight, on the big
screen, will be an experience worth remembering. The background score had a raw and tribal feel to it. The most
invigorating score, since The Last of the Mohicans, that is sure to
pump up the adrenaline during the battle scenes and give us chills
during the more tragic and sensitive scenes.DirectionAlejandoro González Iñárritu is the Picasso of modern cinema. He is a
creative genius. Each and every single frame was like a beautifully and
patiently drawn painting. If, Birdman (2014) was him using the camera
in such a subtle way that the entire movie appeared to be like one
large painting; The Revenant too is extremely realistic, although,
compared to Birdman, it is much more violent and raw, which was to be
expected, because of the several scenes that involved battle and
bloodshed. It requires a special kind of genius to portray even such
scenes, that would normally be gory, as precisely made brush strokes on
a canvas. His direction complemented the cinematography, perfectly. It
turned The Revenant from a 156- minute long slow period revenge drama
into a visual spectacle to be experienced and remembered for the rest
of our lives. If this movie deserves an Oscar, it is only for the Best Director. Mr. Iñárritu is the rarest of the rare breed of talented individuals.
He is man of great vision and aesthetics, as can be seen not only by
The Revenant and Birdman, but, also by the movies that he directed
prior to these. His talent is to be cherished. We can expect even
greater things from him in the future.SummaryThe Revenant is Alejandoro González Iñárritu's most brutally realistic
movie till date. The way that he has captured the actor's performances
and the beautiful landscapes, will propel The Revenant to break to
great heights in the history of Hollywood. It is his direction, that
puts the performances by the lead pair and every other technical
element in the film, on a higher pedestal for everyone to see and
admire.Kudos to him and the entire team, for shooting in such trying
conditions and presenting us with an experience of a lifetime.

brains action and survival and a wink to the Indian American community,
if you think this movie was slow and boring you are in fact insane
because this has been the greatest movie in a long while and yes i
haven't watched star wars yet but damn this movie was great i do have a
question bout the movie there is a guy who fought a bear and survived
and i wonder if this movie is based on him but i'm not sure it seems to
be based on a novel, but that prob not matter much you should just
watch this movie and if you don't like it throw your TV or computer out
of your window because your a spoiled dick who deserves to rot in hell

The Revenant is what happens when a strictly bordering-on- mediocre
film gets universal acclaim. It wouldn't be correct to call it a mess
because there are some scenes to marvel at, especially the wide angle
shots of Calgary's forests and sunlight filtering through clumps of
forests on a white canvas. The one take thing which gave Birdman an
edge is simply a distraction here as the camera seemingly cannot decide
where to stay and , instead, meanders pointlessly here and there as the
film does. There are a lot of inspired moments from Kurosawa's climax
in Throne of Blood, a lot of Tree of Life inspired juvenile philosophy
thrown in for good measure and a ready dose of scenes structured around
Birdman. But what absolutely kills the film is the amazingly banal
sentimentality which is presented in the form of universality. Innaritu
presents us with a lot of images. A lot. They are pretty dazzling to be
honest, extremely cinematic, but as light as fluff. And as pointless as
DiCaprio eating a raw bison liver to get into the skin of his
character, or a horse. or whatever.

I wanted this to be great - I should have known better, especially
since it was nominated for an Oscar. The criteria theses days for an
Oscar seems to be that the movie must be long (check) and boring
(check). This certainly delivered. Don't waste your time or money. I
saw this at an RPX so I am twice as upset since they charged an extra
$7.50 (per person). It was sold out in two theater's so I had to wait
until Sunday night. All I can say is don't believe the hype/Oscar buzz.
I fell for it and I am sorely disappointed! I felt the same way about
Kings Speech. I gave The Revenant a chance because Leo was in it and
he's a great actor. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one.

While watching movie i have been lost in that world that is what true
actors like Leonardo do they don't just act they live in that role
given to them.Exceptional performance from an exceptional actor...who
in the world literally eats an animal liver for a movie role knowing
its potentially very harmful..hats off to you Leonardo...you always
take movies to whole new level with your character in movies...you
always take challenging roles and work hard to fit in that role as if
nobody else would have acted better than you for such roles,every
single movie of you is a masterpiece and just because of your hard work
and talent and that's why i say you may or may not deserve Oscar but
Oscar truly deserves you....:)

The stars of the movie is the scenery and the cinematography (even
though I'd never want to go to any of those sites). It was beautiful in
a way 'Dr Zhivago' was but the Russian epic had other things going for
it too.The story was 'Tarantiono does Grisley Adams'. The violent opening
scene is an echo of the starting scenes to 'Saving Private Ryan' -
shocking violence, retelling what were once portrayed as bloodless.
While this was an action movie it was no thriller. Knowing the running
time and that some of the main characters had to die, was my guide but
I wasn't invested in the outcome. The end came as a welcome relief and
if they are editing for a shorter version - less DiCaprio would be my
preference.The bears were beautiful and almost too believable with every hair
distinguishable. I confess, I was rooting for the bear! Right was
certainly on her side.Tom Hardy has had a hell of a few years from 'Loche', 'Peaky Blinders'
and 'Legend'. He was easy to watch because his character clearly didn't
give a '*&%$'.D Gleeson was almost unrecognizable in 'Star Wars Ep VII' and is the
new hope for gingers everywhere.Some people think the movie will have trouble making back the budget
because the handsome stars keep their clothes on but in fairness,
depressing doesn't sell. Look at 'The Road'! I say - imagine it without
the woeful drama and just enjoy the majesty on the big screenFor those of us who don't lead a charmed life like DiCaprio, we don't
need to pay 6 -10 for another 3 hours of it. That's why Christmas is
so popular - its an invitation to be happy.

Leo is a decent actor and has hardly ever been great. The
cinematography and/or wilderness was a huge bonus as it adds a vast
mystery to this story. He did alright in this one. The movies he's been
in may have been Good, but his acting no so much. Although, he was
pretty good in...that wallstreet movie and D'Jango Unchained but that's
it. I think (I can't at the moment think of others). As to detail to
Revenant, it is boring and tedious, never really developing anything
but Leos character' retribution or revenge. The bear scene was good but
not movie-making magic, as another review says. While I appreciate the
ordeal the real man had to endure, the movie simply lacked character.

Oh,man... If Leonardo does not get his Oscar for this finally, I think
that those people sitting there are insane!The film as a whole is good. Although it is some two and a half hours,
it is not boring, but it is not really exciting either. What kept me
watching it was beautiful scenery and really beautiful shots! In the
beginning of the film, I had an impression that the film was shot like
panoramic photography...wide angle to really capture the beauty of the
scenery. And the scenery is great. I believe the film was shot in
Canada... Not sure.The scene with a grizli bear...Man oh man...Was that the real bear?
Whatever it is - it was impressive! As well as the dead horse scene
when he sleeps inside. Brutal, powerful and at the same time beautiful!
And I must say that there were so many powerful, brutal and beautiful
scenes as it is the movie.My rating takes mostly into consideration how beautifully shot the film
was, how good Leonardo - first of all - was and Tom too. As I said, the
story and 'entertainment' were not really to my liking.Worth the watch! Hoping Leonardo to get that statue!

My popcorn tin was heavier when I binned it than when I collected it.
Why did I throw up when watching The Revenant? There isn't that much
gore to speak of.. What's worth a loud unflattering speech is the
wooden spoon of pseudo-philosophical pretensions AG Iñárritu gags the
audience with for 2 hours and 26 minutes. I sat with that warm tin on
my lap even through the 10 minute credits, contemplating.Consider that Glass' chief motivation for returning from the grave
(gravely wounded really) is his love for his Pawnee son, with whom the
only memorable scene shared is patting him down from an outburst
against Fitzgerald's (Hardy) ferociously racist taunts. He only becomes
that much close to him after Fitzgerald coats his rusty knife with the
teenager's gastric juice, in a powerfully screamed-out scene.Consider how much running time we spend watching Glass wander wistfully
into the afterlife, despite knowing full well he'll overcome his bear
wounds for a showdown or the film wouldn't be funded. He eavesdrops on
whispers by his murdered wife's wraith, only to wake up and cauterize
his torn-open neck with gunpowder; Iñárritu wants to both have his
bison liver and eat it. How much can you cheat the narrative? Most
stimulating of all is the Darwinian symbolism, as Glass evolves from
being bruised and buried, to a crawling creature, to a one-legged
limper, to a biped man to a horseback riding gunfighter... In Alfonso
Cuarón's Gravity, evolutionary symbolism at the end served a purpose of
underpinning how survival is a prerequisite for evolution, we wouldn't
be writing reviews on IMDb if Neanderthals hadn't scrambled Mousterian
tools 300,000 years ago. Here, Glass gets wounded and persists only to
become the same man again.... not even a wiser fellow.Above everything, the over-ballyhooed bear attack is dampeningly
underwhelming. Not-to-spoil anything, but you remember it, how you give
a cat a bowl of milk, the bowl gets swirled around a bit with only a
few licks of milk spilling over the edges.. Yeah. Oh, it's not even all
in one long continuous take as it's been touted to be, there's a very
visible cut soon after Glass arms himself with a knife. I'll also add
that fully-grown bears have been documented to run off porcupined with
spears, only for the spears to be found a few miles away.... with the
bear still missing. SPEARS.On the other hand, The Revenant is filmed with such surreal beauty.
Lubezki's camera floats around inordinately, (pans more than it tracks)
and he seems to find heavenly imagery in every 360° plane. Nature has
never looked better in a Hollywood production. There's a grim fairytale
(& Ron Fricke-esque) edge to the proceedings. The wide-screen frames
are filled with towering forestry, snowmelt and dew drops dripping off
the damp lushly colored leaves in close-up. Negatively charged oxygen
reaches for your lungs off the screen. When the film slackens to
luxuriate in wonder, never is it boring; it's only catching its breath.The editing is often fabulous. From flame-to-flame match cuts in the
snow, and most memorably, Glass' labored breath fogs the lens,
dissolves into clouds floating in the mountain ranges which are then
viciously consumed by Fitzgerald's pipe smoke.But Ho! there... characters' lives are risked for this virtuosity.
There's a scene in which Jim Bridger, the story's most conflicted
entity, when finding their way to camp with Fitzgerald, happens upon a
massacred native village, huts still smoking. Him and us, (but not
Fitzgerald) see a surviving lady, for whom Bridger leaves a parcel
whose contents neither we nor her know to be; she's seen Fitzgerald
stomp around and cuss, knows his inclination towards violence. She has
to choose between 1) staying safely alive by hiding a little longer, or
2) bowing to the logistical limitation of Iñárritu needing to pan
around, show her to the audience discovering bread in the parcel and
pinch off mouthfuls, then urgently cut to the next scene. Does she play
it safe? Not if The Revenant is gonna strike a balance between
manipulative and masterful.Still, despite the objectionable, emetic and offensively on-the-nose
endeavour, Iñárritu deserves an Oscar again, if only for the scene in
which Glass eviscerates a dead horse he's ridden off a cliff, and the
camera smoothly sails around from the horse's back as its viscera are
scooped out, travels in a long take, timed to the action, to find Glass
snuggling into its steaming 'womb' then conclude with a close-up of his
face. Wow!! (No matter how many takes and fired crew members it took)The most human performance is by Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald,
consistently flawed and gleaming with gallows humor. Don't be surprised
if during the final snowy showdown, you're rooting for him to cut down
pretentious.DiCaprio, well, he..... works the hardest. You know that clip they play
at the Oscars, your most electrifying moment during a performance,
DiCaprio's here is effectively a grisly series of those. My two
favorite are him trying-to-not-blink to save his life, and him crawling
out of a shallow snow grave, and mortared between his teeth, equal
parts spit and grit. Despite my reservations, I'll cheer a lung out for
either clip.You can almost hear the voices in his head (his Birdman?) yell in
Calvin Candie rhetoric; "Eddie Redmayne, that new kid, he gimped
hisself out last yur, won that Oscar for it.. What are you gonna do,
Huh!?!"Such a troubled production, he ate real raw bison liver, yet still he
required 5 stunt doubles and 3 photo doubles... that there is a
metaphor for the whole movie.While the film is never boring, calling it entertaining would be
flattering it. No exhilaration derives from watching a man ride a horse
off a cliff; the experience is very akin to staring into an open wound,
waiting patiently for it to a cicatrize into a scar. 7/10.

This movie was really good Leonardo DiCaprio did a really good acting
it was really like a real scene was going on instead of a movie. It had
some flaws like how could he survive bear attack and after that how can
he survive the fall from the cliff but still it was a very good movie
the direction was really amazing i mean like Alejandro did a great job
every scar , every death , every place was captured in a really amazing
manner .The story is very simple DiCaprio has his son killed by Tom
Hardy and is left in a very bad shape and he recovers and takes his
revenge but how he takes his revenge and his recovery (really i mean
his recovery was very tragic) is just captured in a amazing way .This
is a must watch ,this movie is a bit slow but it is worth it just go
and see it.

*** This review contains spoilers****I'll start by saying my review may have been more positive had I not
read the book first. Before getting to the movie itself, the acting was
good, although I think Tom Hardy outperformed Leonardo DiCaprio.After reading the book I was excited to see the movie, but ended up
pretty much hating the film and Hollywood for it's typical over-
embellishment and to-be-expected shame on you USA finger-wagging.
Hollywood apparently thinks there are no bounds to literary license.
Apparently for the screenwriter and director, surviving a grizzly
attack in the middle of nowhere in the early 1800s and then setting out
to avenge oneself isn't a compelling enough story, so they felt the
need to leave the world of reality and add things that will make you
scratch your head and say "why?" and "impossible." First things first,
the attack happened on Sept. 1st, but the movie was set in the dead of
winter. There is no way Glass would have survived in those temperatures
and then to further insult our intelligence they kept tossing him into
a freezing river to keep him wet and freezing, yet not an inkling of
frostbite to mar Leonardo's pretty face. Also, the bear nearly removed
his scalp, but that wouldn't do for our handsome star, instead they
removed half of Fitzgerald's (Hardy's) scalp and kept Leonardo looking
good. Why set this movie in the dead of winter, which would have made
it impossible for Glass to survive? Also, it's not enough to survive a
grizzly attack and this change of seasons, let's throw him off a 100+
ft cliff with a pine tree breaking his fall, just because the stupid
audience wouldn't find the story compelling enough otherwise. That
didn't happen in the book. Also, Glass never married in real life, so
why add an Indian wife and son? Again, because the stupid audience
wouldn't find his quest for vengeance compelling enough without
Hollywood adding a fictional son to be stabbed to death by Fitzgerald
right in front of Glass' face? And those awful images of his wife
constantly being thrust upon us to draw us into the movie more
emotionally again because the truth just wasn't' enough?Now for the Hollywood sermon you had to foresee about the evil white
man stealing the land and animals from the Indians  sermon provided by
a chief who didn't appear in the book; and to make the white man look
more evil and the Indians more victimized, Hollywood thought "Let's add
a part where the whites steal the chief's daughter and use her for a
sex slave to justify all of the atrocities committed by the Indians."
Seriously?! And that's not enough! Let's make Leonardo look even better
by having him, while still recovering from a grizzly attack, rescue the
Indian girl from the French trappers and escape completely unharmed.
The movie is basically a complete work of fiction and should stop
claiming to be based on a true story and should have changed the name
of the move so there was no confusing it with the book. Why not also
change Hugh Glass's name to something more masculine like Dirk Hammer
and cast him as a trans-gendered male. That would be compelling right?
They even took events that happened to Glass and made them happen to
Fitzgerald and Bridger, like wandering through the burned out village
and feeding the Indian woman.They painted Hugh Glass as an experienced scout, again let's build up
our Hollywood star, when he wasn't at the time of the attack. Captain
Henry was the only one on the expedition who have ever navigated that
far west before, yet they build that into Glass's character and have
Henry exclaim, "Glass knows this land better than all of us put
together." And at the end, instead of Glass kicking the crap out of
Bridger, they have Capt. Henry do the butt-kicking while painting Glass
as the compassionate and forgiving one. They also change the ending.
Glass never killed Fitzgerald, but he basically does in the movie, He
takes Fitzgerald to the brink of death (he would have bled out within
10 min) and then stops when he remembers an Indian friend telling him
that vengeance is God's, so Glass doesn't finish him off, instead
choosing to dump him in the river to allow the "fictional" Indian chief
who's watching 100 feet downstream do the honors. Why? Does that
absolve Glass of the murder and make him more honorable? I don't get
it. The overall worst directing blunder was to set the movie in the dead of
winter. Only ignorant Hollywood types who have never experienced a cold
winter would think it would be possible for a human to survive the
extreme temperatures, often while wet, with little to no fire and for
months, not a day or two. In the movie, Glass should have been dead
from the cold before Fitzgerald and Bridger ever left him. Hollywood
ruined a great story by ridiculously and unbelievably enhancing it to
use as a vehicle for a Leonardo DiCaprio Oscar run. And then there goes
Tom Hardy outshining him. What a shame. Skip the movie and read the
book. Stupid, ignorant, preachy, Hollywood!

'The Revenant' is unlike any movie you will ever see. It is an
absolutely breathtaking film about one of the most insane human feats
ever. The film is all about a man by the name of Hugh Glass. A man that
survives a bear attack. A man that then crawls and limps his way 200
miles after the man that slaughtered his son before his very eyes.
Saying that this man is hardcore is an understatement. What he endears
is a testament to how resilient the human spirit can be. So who better
to play him than the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio. This could very well
be the film that finally gets him that coveted golden statue at the
Oscars this February. Aside from the insanity that is this story and
Leos superb performance, this film has a lot to offer. Most noticeably
is how the film itself looks. Shot in all natural light, 'The Revenant'
is able to bring a sense of realism that few films have achieved. It's
a beautiful film to behold that effortlessly sucks you into its world.Honestly, if I were to rate this film from a technical stand point it
would most definitely receive a perfect rating. Everything done behind
the camera is flawless. The standout being Inarritu himself. There are
some scenes in this film with so many moving parts it's a wonder how he
is able to control them all. We have fights between white men and
Indians that flow so naturally that you can practically feel like
you're there. Yet I found myself ultimately disappointing with this film. Perhaps
this my fault. Coming straight off 'Birdman' I found the next film that
Inarritu was making and kind of went crazy. I saw this films story line
along with the director and all star cast and have been losing my mind
waiting for it ever since. I held this film up like many people were
doing with 'The Force Awakens'.That being said, as I watched I found some very obvious mistakes. The
film never felt like it quite made it to a final draft. The problem
with this film is that we don't learn one single thing about our main
character. He is certainly the most determined human being of all time
but what do we really learn about him? There seems to be nothing making
him a man other than a convoluted back story with a side of vengeance.
There is so few character traits that we can actually point to that
make him human.This makes the lengthy two and a half hour run time drag at times. He
tries to survive then runs from Indians over and over and over again.
There is a point where this just isn't exciting any more. And it left
me longing for some actual character moments from him. In fact the only
characters we really get to know aren't in the film all that much.
What's stranger is that, through the entire run time, a tribe of
Indians is on his tail for absolutely no reason. Yeah they are looking
for a stolen girl but why on earth are they following the company that
they demolish at the beginning of the film? Obviously she isn't with
them so why on earth didn't they investigate literally anyone else?The subplots in this film made so little sense that switching back to
our relatively bland main character came as a breath of fresh air. The
film never really felt like it was fully thought through. There was so
many things that didn't add up that following the repetitive journey of
DiCaprio became, at times, a strain. But somehow, it remains a good
movie. It's gritty, hard to watch, but most of all an absolute
spectacle and landmark in film making.

The Revenant is Alejandro Iñàrritu's majestic revenge story set in the
early 1800s that follows the larger than life true story of Hugh Glass
(Leonardo DiCaprio) as he travels across old America in hopes of
exacting revenge against the men that left him gravely wounded and his
son dead. The revenge story line is the oldest in the book and, no
matter how overplayed, evokes the most emotion especially when the
players are right. DiCaprio, Tom Hardy and Will Poulter make for some
pretty excellent players in Iñàrritu's more visual film and this allows
audience members to connect with the film on a more accessible level
rather than the cinephiles that this film was made for. Emanuel Lebezki
has, yet again, outdone himself. The beauty in each frame is
undeniable. The landscapes, the snow, the blood, the violence. No
matter how harrowing a situation is, the film is still one of the most
beautiful ever made and this is a testament to Lebezki and Iñàrritu.
The patience they endured on set speaks volumes to the film that they
made. The Revenant isn't fast paced, it isn't action packed, it is a
story told through the eyes of a visionary and that may off put some
people who are looking for a film like The Hunted or The Grey or any
other man against wilderness film. The film is slow and takes it's time
in giving the audience something they can sink their teeth into.
Instead, they allow the audience to be submersed in this cold and
desolate landscape, all while capturing the beauty of the American
landscape. The battle scenes are epic. Mostly done through extended
long takes, the film is a cinephile's dream. The camera movements, the
tracking shots and that glorious bear attack are all beautifully done
and shown in the most harrowing way possible. For a film to open with
an over 10 minute long take of a battle nonetheless, it is truly
captivating and awe inspiring to see filmmakers push themselves to
their limits both physically and creatively. But as much as the
filmmakers pushed themselves, so did the cast. Leonardo DiCaprio gives
a brilliant performance as Hugh Glass. In films before, we've seen
DiCaprio fake pain. In this film, you actually feel his pain. With
every bite from a bear, every broken bone being reset, every wound
being crudely stitched, his performance reeks of perfection and that is
exactly what we get from him here. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald is a
typical bad guy here, nothing more nothing less. He's good, he's not on
the level of DiCaprio here though. The rest of the cast is amazing, as
always with any Iñàrritu film. Overall, The Revenant is a brilliant
film that isn't quite a masterpiece but has enough technical
achievements within it to set it apart from any other film this year. I
definitely recommend it.

I found the story way too basic. If you remove Dicaprio, you have
nothing left, except nice shots of the great American nature. Furthermore, as often, the ''Hollywood state agency'' found a way to
distort history and pictured the French as cold blooded native peoples
murderers. FRANCIS PARKMAN ARGUED, "Spanish civilization crushed the Indian;
English scorned and neglected him; French civilization embraced and
cherished him."Unlike their competitors, the Spanish and the English, the French often
established excellent relations with native peoples during the conquest
of the New World.

Fist let me say this. I like Leonardo Di Caprio movies because I think
he is one of those actors who does good movies which are entertaining
too. But this one is neither good or Entertaining. This one is 2 Hr 40
minutes of nothing but great visuals and desperate attempt to get Leo
an Oscar...Leo needs to understand fans love him because he does good
movies . Regardless of Oscars, he will still be loved. This movie has 0
script. A super boring revenge movie that doesn't make any sense
sometimes . I mean what happens after the bear attack is laughable. Leo
who is almost dead ,suddenly starts crawling after his son is killed
and he is buried. And how did he survive through the wilderness for
those many days Half Dead!!!!Also The biggest failure is that the emotions between Leo and his son
doesn't come through. If the audience could feel the emotions, the log
boring screenplay would have been little more tolerable ..And 1 thing,Tom Hardy should come with Subtitles....Nobody could get
what he was saying. Overall a big disappointment from Leo..Rare but it is a colossal
disappointment after J Edgar Hoover..

After giving us a Masterpiece & Winning The Academy-Award for Best
Director, Picture & Screenplay in Birdman, Alejandro G. Iñárritu
returns on celluloid with 'The Revenant'. And the master storyteller
triumphs again! Let me inform you: 'The Revenant' is NOT Meant For The Faint-Hearted.
This is a brutal, unforgiving, hardcore film about survival & revenge.
This a story filled & driven by blood & bruises. But if you are
thick-skinned, don't dare to miss this one. This is filmmaking at its
most creative & most relentless. 'The Revenant' Synopsis: In the 1820s, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass
sets out on a path of vengeance against those who left him for dead
after a bear mauling.Inspired by the life of frontiersman Hugh Glass, 'The Revenant' is
ideally a vendetta fare, that's been shot so gorgeously, you forget
you're watching a story thats been depicted on celluloid an endless
number of times. Iñárritu creates a World of violence in the wild,
where people are butchered, the animals are ferocious than ever.
Watching the protagonist struggle after a brutal bear mauling (Which by
the way is a Frightening Sequence), is often difficult to watch, as he
struggles & how. But at the end, Justice is served & the dramatic
climax leaves a superb impact.Mark L. Smith & Iñárritu's Screenplay is unforgiving. Its a survival
tale with vendetta as its wallpaper. The wilderness & the violence have
no end here & the narrative remains strong, despite its predictable
storyline. Iñárritu's Direction is Masterful. He has handled the film
with breath-taking ambition. Emmanuel Lubezki's Cinematography makes
'The Revenant' a visual marvel. The Two-Time Back-to-Back Oscar-Winner
has captured every frame, with such beauty, you almost feel you're in
the story. A Third Oscar? Well, why not!Stephen Mirrione's Editing is sharp, although the film tends to drag a
bit & is a bit too long (157-minutes). Some trimming would've only
enhanced the impact more. Ryuichi Sakamoto, Alva Noto & Bryce Dessner's
Score is brilliant. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Action-
Sequences are raw & brutal. CGI is perfectly done.Now to the Performances! 'The Revenant' features Two of the Finest
Actors of their generation coming together: Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom
Hardy. And they more than rise up to the occasion. Leo is phenomenal as
the struggling protagonist, who must avenge the death of his son & bear
any numbers of consequences that come his way. Its a committed
performance, that has great layers. Hardy is despicable as the chief
villain, delivering a marvelously evil performance, that haunts you. Of
the supporting cast, Domhnall Gleeson stands out with an impressive
act.On the whole, 'The Revenant' is Visually Dazzling, Fabulously Acted &
Impeccably Made. A Must Watch!

This movie is my biggest cinematographic disappointment ever. I didn't
read the book. I just saw a trailer. I love Leo. I hoped for inspiring
survival and adventure movie like Apocalypto or somewhere close. But it
was just nothing.I real gritty and atmospheric is all this movie offers. Gruesomeness.
But even if you like that it all gets spoiled by slow hard to believe
and hard to make credible story parts. It has sadistically slow pace
and genuine lack of substance. Lot of grunting and moaning... And
eating raw flesh. Simple, plain, pale and uninteresting plot.Also guys that get hurt like that by a bear just don't survive in the
cold and without antibiotics. You just can't spend few hours soaked in
cold mountain cold water up to your ears, get out, make fire in a few
minutes. Screenwriters ever heard of hypothermia and wet flint? Wound
infections and gangrene? His broke ankle also just disappears over
night...And to end of all jokes tired like that and wounded so bad he fights
with one of the toughest hunters and wins. It is infuriatingly bad just waste of time, and pile of ...If you still can't resist but watch it, don't feel guilty to walk out
of theater or turn the play device off after an hour you will spare
yourself and miss nothing.

An extraordinary film on many levels: 1. As pure entertainment, give it a quarter hour and you will be
hooked. This is a survival/revenge story so pure, so beautifully
filmed, at times it seems more like a National Geographic documentary.
I guarantee that when you leave the theatre you will think twice about
complaining when you shovel the driveway, or when you are tempted to
return food in a restaurant because it is undercooked.2. As a clinic in how to direct a film, Iñárritu is at the top of his
game. When you think back on what you watched --- and you will think
back -- you will have to conclude that the director somehow managed to
tell the heavens what weather to provide on any given shooting day; and
even arranged for a wild bear to attack on cue but leave the actor
alive ..... there are scenes in this movie that you literally will
never forget. The "horse motel" for one. And the demonstration that the
fastest way to get to the bottom of a mountain when you are being
chased is simply to jump off the top of it.3. As a showcase for Hardy, this will become a welcome part of his body
of work. I am convinced that Hardy, an actor who acts with his entire
body, will be studied and appreciated by audiences of the future. My
favorite role of his was Warrior where he practically stole every scene
he was in. Child 44 is also worth a watch if you have not seen it.4. Some IMDb members are hard on DiCaprio and they should not be. He is
at the stage of his career where he can take a massively "physical"
role like without having to worry about fickle fans not approving of
his career choices. It is hard to imagine many other actors that could
have pulled this off.Not really a film. An experience.

I love that this film allowed us to see things from the Native
American's perspective as-well, and not just the New-American hunting
teams perspective. What many movies lack nowadays is the ability to really showcase
character development, though I feel this movie succeeded in this. If
you can grow attached to a certain character in a film, then the
development of that character is portrayed correctly. I like that. Leonardo DiCaprio is my favorite actor of all time, because he is able
to smash any role he plays with pure believability. I haven't seen all
of Leo's films, but my favorite performances of his were from the
movies "The Wolf of Wall Street", "Inception", "Shutter Island", "Blood
Diamond" and now my all time favorite performance of his is "The
Revenant"; he absolutely dominated this role! His ability to portray a
character with such depth is stupendous. He has previously played many
good character rolls, yet no Oscar; if he doesn't not get an Oscar from
the most in-depth character yet, then I have no idea how he will ever
get an Oscar.. Give this man and Oscar already! HE DESERVES IT! 10
TIMES OVER!I'm not usually one for slow paced films because they tend to drag on
and on for eternity, but for the slow paced film this was, it was very
intriguing. I love a film that can capture you in the moment and really
bring you in on their story. Although, I do believe The Revenant ended
prematurely. Though this movie goes for 156 minutes, I feel as if an
extra 10-15 minutes could have been added to create a superb ending,
making for a near perfect film. If you struggle to stay enticed by a slow paced film because it doesn't
have fast pace action and/or story movement, then I recommend you steer
clear of this movie because it's most likely not for you. For those who
don't mind if a movie is slow paced because it has a phenomenal story
build-up and admirable character development, then I'd recommend the
watch!8/10

Awesome movie, that will surely get many Oscar awards for best actor
(Leonardo DiCaprio), supporting actor (Tom Hardy), cinematography and
makeup, best director and best picture, possibly costume design and
editing. The bear attack scene is monumental and memorable, I do not
remember having seen a bear attack described so well in all its
wildness in any film or documentary. The many landscapes of wild nature
are very beautiful! Leonardo DiCaprio's wounds and tormented face are
so well rendered, I do not know how one can lose the Oscar for makeup.
Throughout the film, Leo plays absolutely brilliant, with Tom Hardy
also excellent. The movie is very well built in details, it has
memorable scenes (like the one when jumping on the horse from the cliff
and surviving in the freezing night that followed) and depicts very
well the struggle to survive in harsh natural conditions in frontier
areas in those times. Awesome cinema experience for a viewer -
congratulations to the whole film crew for a job well done!

The Revenant (2015) is a very beautifully crafted film featuring
Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Will Poulter; this is quite possibly
one of the top films created in 2015. Christmas 2015 we at WoodBangers
Entertainment got the honor of checking out The Revenant (2015) and it
was well worth the opportunity. The Revenant (2015) releases January
7th and 8th in the U.S. and I'm sure everyone who sees it will not be
let down. This film has an amazing cast, a great story-line, cinematics
which will blow your socks off; it's a perfect film.So starting out 2016 with The Revenant, I'd say is a hope for a better
year in film, check out The Revenant (2015) the moment you have the
chance.

One of the best movies I've seen in the last 10 years. Since The
Aviator I haven't seen DiCaprio so intense. Close to perfection. This
is something new for him. The filming conditions, the cast, the stunts.
Everything is so detailed.The story is sad, but everyone can become Glass at one moment. At some
moment we all have nothing to lose.The glory of the story relays on the ambition and determination of
every human being.Personally I vote and hope for him to get an Oscar. He fully deserves
it.

The Revenant is directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and is written
by Mark L. Smith and Alejandro González Iñárritu. It stars Leonardo
DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, and Will Poulter along with Domhall Gleeson and
Forrest Goodluck.A frontiersman named Hugh Glass on an fur trade expedition in the 1820s
is on a quest for survival after being brutally mauled by a bear.The Revenant is a movie that really grew on me over the course of a
week. When I initially saw it, Christmas Day, I hated this movie with a
passion, but after a week of contemplation, I can officially say The
Revenant is one of the best films of the year.If for nothing else, this movie is spectacular just on a visual level.
With an astounding feat in cinematography,mastery of CGI, (especially
in a scene with a huge bear) and the use of natural lighting, this
movie transports you to the unforgiving and ill- tempered wilderness,
Mister Hugh Glass had to trudge through.The direction by Iñárritu in this movie was a bit uneven. He made the
active decision to use continuous shots which worked to some extent,
but when the focus is placed on multiple moving subjects, it becomes
rather disorienting. With that said, these continuous shots work at
holding the intensity when the focus is placed directly on DiCaprio
and/or Hardy.Moving past its visual style and into the depths of tits plot, this
movie was met with a myriad of problems. The largest of these problems
involved this movie's genre. Unsure if its a survival drama or a
revenge thriller but sure it wants to be art-house, The Revenant, in
turn, fails at all three. It flops as a art-house movie because there
isn't enough in the story to be something mind bending. It fails as a
revenge thriller because aside from three phenomenal confrontations,
revenge is rarely mentioned. Finally, it fails as a survival drama
because of the predictability behind Glass' character.Speaking of Mister Glass and switching back to the positives, Leonardo
DiCaprio barely uttering a word in English, gives the single best
physical performance, I think I've ever seen. DiCaprio masters his
character to deliver a spectacle of absolute realism. Brooding, somber,
and broken DiCaprio earns himself another Oscar nod.Tom Hardy is also absolutely astounding and does manage to out shine
DiCaprio in some scenes nearing the end of the movie. I foresee a
possible Oscar nod on his part as well. A major surprise for me was to
see Will Poulter deliver a very nuanced performance, more than holding
his own against the two seasoned actors.The Revenant is a deeply flawed but ultimately wholly entertaining
movie with great performances all-round and a great deal of visual
charm. The Revenant gets a B+ or a 7/10.

Brilliant. Just brilliant. Cinematography,directing,acting,...just
outstanding. Leonardo diCaprio is a sure win at the Oscars without any
doubth. In the movie he has barely 10-15 lines but his expressions of
pain and agony especially in the bear scene and also when whitnessed
his son being murdered are just remarkable. The scenery is also
breathtaking but we should expect that from on of the most promising
directors in the world. Tom Hardy gave his best and is certainly a big
contender for an Oscar in the supporting actor category. For all of you
who taught his voice in Dark Night Rises is modified after watching
this film you will be proved wrong. The story was captivating and
almost every scene just made you feel bad for Hugo Glass but there are
a few moments when you partialy understand what Fitzgerald is going
through and why he did what he did.Tom Hardy in a sense humanised the
Fitzgerald character even though he is made as a bad guy in this. All
in all,a great great movie and all movie lovers should very much enjoy
watching it.

This Alejandro González Iñárritu directed masterpiece was under immense
pressure after the director's victory in the Oscars for direction and
best film last year. Him uniting with one of the industry's best
actors, Leonardo Di Caprio, invited even more buzz. Well, the film more
than delivers. The story in all its familiarity is about survival, the
protagonist has to deal, post being left to die by his mates after
getting attacked by a grizzly bear. It though tries to include elements
of love and pain of loss, but keeps its focus towards having minimal
layers.The film is another epitome in cinematography. In certain parts, the
camera work and execution is so out of the world, I missed few dialogs
purely enchanted by Emmanuel Lubezki's work. This man is in the middle
of the most towering run ever achieved by a cinematographer. No other
cinematographer has won three straight Oscars, and Lubezki, who won the
Oscars for Gravity and Birdman, is the most eligible winner for yet
another, thanks to his sky faced- wide lens-natural light portrayal of
the main character's journey. With how much difficulty, Alejandro
prepared for such long shots, where the camera almost turned anywhere,
is near beyond anyone's idea. Though Lubezki already has a similar
experience with Children of Men, this definitely must have been much
tougher taking into the account the extreme sub zero degrees of the
locations, loosely also helping it achieve the tag of being one of the
most difficult films to be shot. The film reportedly faced countless
obstacles not only related to weather but also due to number of staff
either quitting in the middle of the production or being fired by the
director (could be also due to weather). On several occasions he was
asked to use technology instead of real locations due to seasonal
changes which didn't help with the consistent look of the film. But
Alejandro stayed firm on his stand of not using a green screen, only to
let the actors feel the chill to their bones in order to generate
authenticity. And for this he had to shoot in 12 different locations
including US, Canada and Argentina. Without divulging much, the Bear
attack scene and one other Horse chase is shockingly real for its
closeness and the quick multiple movements of the camera, to ultimately
provide audience a raw almost first hand perspective of the whole.
These scenes are such, if not prepared, will most definitely make you
spit a loud "FUCK!" Acting is top notch, though I really hope Tom gets
at least an Oscar Nomination nod since he was snubbed in the Golden
Globes, he is totally electrifying as the villain. I am sure, had he
been given more scenes he would have gone past Leo. Leo gives another
stellar performance to decorate his body of work, the filth scale he
plays with is on par with Kill Bill sort of films though this is much
higher in its aesthetic presentation. The writing doesn't quite match
to its cinematography or acting, though that is not to say, its bad,
but just that the standards set by those two other departments is so
high, it makes others, difficult to get there. I'd definitely rate
Alejandro's Birdman higher in screenplay. In all, this film is an
intense, raw yet beautiful portrayal of a simple story backed with
engaging pace and masterful direction. Easily on the top, along with
the best films of the year.

There's been a long dry spell since Dicaprio starred in a decent
thriller, this film has ended that dry spell.If you can enjoy a movie without IMAX, giant screens & surround sound-
then you have found a quality film. I didn't even need to step foot in
a theatre, I've enjoyed this movie with about 480p- and still stunning
imagery. I'm amazed by the views and scenery. It gives you a sense of what
Dicaprio's character is going through. I won't go into any plot...This movie brought back memories from Christopher Noland's films
applaud Alejandro González Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki for their work
in this movie, I look forward to more like this.

So when is DiCaprio going to win an Oscar already? This guy puts his
heart and soul into every movie and he sure knows how to pick them.
This is a movie that has a lot of heart and was terrific from start to
finish. Tom Hardy also was terrific in this one. From the start I was
riveted. If I didn't know this story was true I don't know how vested I
would be in this, but knowing this story really happened it made the
movie incredible. The camera work was brilliant and the CGI was
tremendous in a great bear scene that will be talked about going
forward. Don't miss this one if you can help it. This is about a man
who overcomes adversity over and over again. The only reason I didn't
give it a 10 is because 20 minutes could have been trimmed, but that
about it. It is a must watch so get your popcorn and be amazed at the
how this man lived in the 1830's and what he went through in a
compelling story with great actors.

There is nothing wrong with the film. The acting is perfectly natural
all the way, so natural, that you can't understand what almost anyone
is saying for their mumbling in their shaggy beards, especially the
main crook (Tom Hardy), who isn't credible in his unmotivated evil, and
of course everything goes constantly wrong. They do everything they
shouldn't, go wandering alone in a dark forest when there are bears
around and you can even hear their cubs - these bear hunters couldn't
be unaware that there must be a worried bear mother near by when she
smells a human hunter close to her cubs. Of course, the bear attack
triggers the drama, without which there would be none; but the greatest
folly is in the end, when the two good men go a-hunting for a desperate
murderer in the wilderness and they split up. How could they be so
dumb? Sorry, it's a weak story with no psychology mainly made up for
its effects, and of course, these are marvellous, the main prize going
to the fantastic photography of the wilderness in the awesome landscape
scenes, and here you could actually speak of poetry, but that's about
all. They say it was all shot without any artificial light, which of
course adds to the intriguing atmosphere of the nocturnal scenes, and
the whole enterprise of shooting such a film under sinister conditions
in the wilderness deserves much credit. At best some of the wilderness
scenes succeed in creating some "Call of the Wild"-ecstasy, especially
the most spectacular of them all with the buffaloes. But the story is
such, that you feel rather inclined to take sides with the Indians and
the bears than with these villains causing nothing but mischief in the
wilderness and even failing with that, while the original Richard
Harris-John Huston film from 1971, which I haven't seen yet, could be
expected to be better.You could blame the flaws of the story, which appears to be founded on
fact way up in the Dakota wilderness in the 1820s among Sioux and
Pawnees, on the necessity of the truthfulness of naturalism, people
could actually be this beastly, and if they are beastly they are
usually dumb as well, so let's make allowances for that - realism in
absurdum, which though only makes you take the stronger sides with the
Indians and the bears. One final question mark - even an Indian would
in the end feel motivated to do something for the trapper that after
all saved the life of his daughter, which she couldn't be unaware of,
when she exits with her father with no more than a look.

"When there is a storm, And you stand in front of a tree, If you look
at it's branches, you swear it will fall, But if you watch the trunk,
you will see it's stability." ... Not a so-called 'perfect' movie. But,
I really liked the film,mostly the way of it's story-telling &
on-screen execution. Brutal,Dark,creepy & engaging. What else to be
needed in an Adventurous Thriller! This recent venture of Birdman's
director Alejandro González Iñárritu has lots of reasons to be loved.
It has been an enthralling journey with Mr. Hugh Glass (the prime
character,portrayed by DiCaprio) & the rush of adrenaline has been felt
many times. Another Recognition-demanding performance by the AWESOME
Leonardo DiCaprio.Tom Hardy in the negative character has been treat to
watch. Background score is well-suited to the theme of the film.

We all saw last year's breakthrough from Alejandro, who has won four
Oscars. Yes, I am about "Birdman". If you do not see this unusual film,
I advise you to look at. But today we will talk about another movie ,
namely a new hit from Alejandro '' The Revanant''Even during his announcement, this film immediately was able to
interest the viewer . Of course , who didn't want to see a new movie
with world known Leonardo and in addition with Hardy , who is a rising
star . This movie , just for a couple of weeks , took the lead in most
anticipated films of the year. But , there is another question . Would
Alejandro able to make one more good film , or even better ? No doubt ,
he could !!!After the first few minutes , film make the audience to fall in love
with . Dark shades , magnificent landscapes and atmosphere absorbs the
viewer immediately . If anyone had a doubt about watching this movie ,
they have all disappeared. Just after a first few minutes , you see
that this is the movie that you like . Just one question . How much
this film would be good for you ? Now , let's all take turns:Actors I think , that there are any person in the world who will
consider DiCaprio to be a bad actor. He is just so good in any role
that he play, so viewer can not tear his eyes away from him . About
DiCaprio a can write a lot , but better to see a movie yourself with
him and you'll understand that words can not convey it. During the film
we feel scary about him. Next one , no less known actor  Hardy , for
no one seconds even think to give up Leo. And while watching this
movie, I even didn't know who I like more . Hardy's role and his play
were on high . Other actors were good also . None make audience to feel
bad about their play even for a seconds .Plot The plot of the film is normal. I can't say that it is grateful
and with something unusual but it has a zest which viewer like . Of
course it has some things as all film do that audience will not love
and judge it for simplicity. But I can't do it through a genre.Also , I wanted to mark the work of operator. Movie was made so great
that I can't even say a word . An operator's work is on high. Even a
very simple scene made so that audience can't tear eyes from it .And
this is a big factor that I liked in it , cause film is a little bit
long .I can write a lot of advantages of the film because they are
uncountable . That's why I would like to talk about the disadvantages.
And now everything is much easier. This film doesn't have a big
mistakes . As for me , I even can't see small one . So , if you are a
person who like to look for a mistakes in a movie , it will be hard for
you.Summing up the film , I can definitely say that this is success.
Alejandro surpasses himself and is confident moving for a second Oscar.
If you ask me , whether I advise this film to you? Certainly , yes. I
don't think that you will be disappointed after watching it .Thank you , for reading my review. Hope you like it .

The Revenant relates the story of a fur trapper left for dead by his
team following a fight with a bear. The film is about his battle for
survival in tough wintery conditions, and his quest to avenge the death
of a loved one.What I enjoyed: - This movie is gorgeous. Nature (fauna and flora)
plays a big part in the film, and is beautifully represented on the
screen. I wouldn't mind re-watching it on mutewell not the whole 156
minutes though; - Tom Hardy's performance. I felt that he stood out
from the rest of the cast. John Fitzgerald (his character) is hard to
define. You want to hate him, but soon realise that maybe he is not
that much of a monster; - Nice score. It tied in seamlessly with the
movie.What I liked less: - The film felt unnecessarily long. I think a number
of scenes could have been shorter or cut-out completely without
damaging the director's work; - It is fairly predictable. Don't expect
major plot twists.Would I recommend it? Absolutely. The very realistic "Man vs Bear"
scene, the cinematography and Hardy's character are worth the ticket
price in my opinion.

Really, what a wonderful experience.I was daunted by the film's duration. But after the first scene, I was
applauding the DOP for his innovation and relationship with his
subjects.At the very least, this film should be recognized by its' effective use
of optic technology. Wow It was like II was there - a true advancement
in the craft.A hard call between Leo De Caprio and Tom Hardy for Best Actor or
Supporting role. You know from the first scene who to root for and who
to despise. But something golden has to come of this triumph.I've honestly never experienced such an up-close-and personal sideline
view of a series of events. Thank you for that.I was fortunate to have grown up close to where this film was shot. The
locations are where I leaned how to camp, fish, ski, trek and teach my
son to skate on a mountain lake with snow swept clear by the wind so
you can see the fish 30 feet down.I would have given this movie a 10, but for a couple inaccuracies which
I will not dwell on.Please enjoy his film and pass it on to friends. Ground-breaking
cinematography, a truly compelling story and a truly committed effort
by the actors. (I've been in that water and I'll tell you, Hell is
cold).

I'm surprised no one mentioned the fact this film is a remake of
Richard Sarafian "Man In The Wilderness" starring the great Richard
Harris and John Huston. The Revenant is greatly more dramatic and
graphic and Leonard DiCaprio played an excellent role. I loved the
usage of real American Indians in their roles. The grizzly bear scene
was beyond the best animal attack scene ever. But more credit still
needs to be given to the remake. The snowy winter scene with the rough
water rapids was remarkable. I was hoping for a better ending but what
a saying at the end "Revenge is in God's Hands" and he slid
Fitzgerald's body down to Elk Dog was revenge at it's best

Among DiCaprio's best three or so and I am saying this after watching
all his films!The film is a quite slow paced, so be patient and you will get to see a
brilliant dramatic thriller, probably one of the best ever made!!Great supporting cast, brilliant from every technical perspective!The idea is not unique but the film is.. You will probably start to
figure out the end midway through the film, but you won't be able to
leave your seat!That being said its not flawless. But all that is worth ignoring.2015 saw a lot of good films being made, but this has to be at the very
top! A great way to end the year...or...start a year for that matter,,
he-heAnyway, go watch it. And, Happy New Year!! Have a great time with your
loved ones.

The Revenant weaves history, nature and war into a beautifully shot
film. This slow burning tale of revenge does not rely upon dozens of
dialogue heavy scenes, but it instead focuses on the quintessence of
its subject. I am glad that Iñárritu strays away from a history lesson,
as it allowed a tender era to unfold in a brutal light without
insulting the audience with tiresome exposition. The Oscar dodging Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance.
From start to finish, he puts everything into the character of Hugh
Glass, a man of the American frontier who seeks retribution for the
death of his half-native son. Tom Hardy is Fitzgerald, an unusual
aggressor in that he never truly inflicts harm for pleasure, but his
actions are rather a circumstance of nature, war and innate survival.
This again isn't entirely what we hear, but it is what we see  many
glances, expressions and explosions of anguish tell us of burgeoning
conflict without a word.I feel The Revenant achieves greatness in these scenes. The bear
mauling, Glass' speechless days injured and his subsequent hunt are
beyond enchanting. The supporting cast do what they need to and they do
it well, but their scenes are often stolen by Leo and Hardy's masterful
performances. The past is alluded to in spiritual scenes, and although
gorgeously meaningful, some only exist to retell recent toils in a
confusing fashion. Nonetheless, Iñárritu has directed yet another
masterpiece, soaked in blood and snow, and it would not surprise me if
Leo and he return from The Oscars with a golden man in hand. They
certainly deserve it.

I have to say, I didn't know much going into this movie, besides the
fact that it was set sometime in the past, possibly. Or the future,
dystopian? No idea. The trailer was slow, with DiCaprio dragging
himself through countless acres of backwoods forest, as a slow
heartbeat keeps time. I was ready for this movie.To be perfectly honest, I love all the Academy Award movies. I watch
them all as soon as they are made available, make my own predictions
and prepare myself for the inevitable. Surely THIS is the year Leonardo
DiCaprio earns one, right?Marvel as an unwashed DiCarprio drags himself through countless minutes
of winter wonderland forest, with minimal dialogue and lots of people
and animals dying. Really, was that last horse dying necessary to the
plot of the movie? Come on now. I love all types of movies, blood and
guts, plenty of animals being dead, but this seems a bit over the top.You know why DiCaprio never wins an Oscar? Because with every movie I
see him in, I don't feel like I'm being immersed in his films. You are
always aware of Leonardo DiCaprio in all of his movies - and that makes
it difficult to give him an Oscar. He doesn't fade into any story that
he plays in, becoming the character fully. In all honesty, I like Tom Hardy's performance a lot better, and I
expect that he will win the Oscar for best supporting actor/actress in
a movie. His performance is top notch, the accent thick, and the
character 100%.I love DiCaprio's movies, and we have high hopes for the young man. But
this movie isn't it.

Truly harrowing! I think that's how one would describe this roller
coaster ride of one's doom back up from hell as an avenger only to fall
and rise once more! Two times at deaths door, two times returned on a
mission as the avenger. A man forced to watch them kill his son while
he lay helplessly injured, yet conscious. Buried alive and left for
dead he was forced to claw his way out of his own grave. Slowly healed
over time each day he was kept alive, fuelled only by his endless rage.This movie should do it for Leonardo in the Oscar department. He really
did an awesome job acting as Hugh Glass. The role fit Leo well, and the
desperation, hopelessness and endless pain transports you into the film
like none other Leo has ever done. I think I could even watch this one
a second time down the road!This movie will definitely knock some awards out of the park! The
feeling of desperation oozes out of the viewers pores. The soundtrack,
something often overlooked- awesome, just instills a melancholy setting
that is part and parcel for The Revenant.Bravo on this movie sirs! Truly a masterpiece.

Taking a look at online news sites,I noticed a story about an
"infamous" scene where Leonardo DiCaprio fights a bear in his new
film,which led to me getting ready to go bear hunting with DiCaprio.
The plot-1823:Losing half their men in a surprise attack from the Ree Indians during
a hunt for wildlife pelts,the group find themselves being slowed down
by experienced hunter Hugh Glass,who along with the attack from the Ree
was also badly hurt from a sudden attack from a bear.Wanting someone
else to get their hands dirty,the leader of the gang decides to leave
Hugh behind with Jim Bridger and his son Hawk Glass who are told that
they will be rewarded for killing Hugh. Doubting the boys,fellow outlaw John Fitzgerald gets the leader to give
him permission to stay.Once the rest of the gang have faded
away,Fitzgerald starts trying to kill Hugh. Desperately trying to save
his dad,Hawk fights back but is killed by Fitzgerald.After killing
Hawk,Fitzgerald believes Hugh is minutes from dying,so he decides to
leave him for dead.Shaken out of his near- coma like state by seeing
the dead body of his son on the ground,Hugh Glass pulls his broken,torn
legs off the ground and sets his sights on getting revenge on everyone
who left him and his son behind. View on the film:Gliding along the battle fields,co-writer/(along with Mark L. Smith)
director Alejandro González Iñárritu & cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki
immense the viewer in a harrowing world,as tightly coiled tracking
shots pick up the sliver of blood dripping out of Glass,with Iñárritu
lingering on each aftershock that Glass suffers from every stabbing and
bullet wound.Firmly holding on to the belief of filming in real
locations and using nothing but completely natural light, (which led to
the movie taking months longer than expected to be filmed,with crew
members quitting over the delay) Iñárritu shows that all the trouble
was worth it by using the natural locations to give the title an
extraordinary rustic beauty.Iñárritu releases the delicacy offered by the location in a precise
manner,as lone flickers of light from the trees keeps Glass from
sinking into the freezing river and endless blizzard.Finding darkness
in the beauty of the location, Iñárritu brilliantly stabs the delicate
appearance of the location with a blunt-force documentary
intensity,which goes from a breathtakingly brittle bear attack,to the
blood of Glass & Fitzgerald splattering against the camera.Partly adapting Michael Punke's novel,the writers offer a brief glimpse
of the wild west sunset by giving Glass's relationship with his son a
touching tenderness which haunts the entire film.Pulling the knife out
of the "traditional" glamorous aspects of the revenge tale,the writers
drive their Western into a decaying Film Noir world,where every step
Glass takes for revenge leads to him losing pounds of flesh as his torn
apart heart struggles to survive in the dead to the wild wilderness he
has been left in.Pulling the "challenges" he had with Iñárritu onto the screen,Tom Hardy
(who during a heated "debate" wrestled with Iñárritu!) gives a chilling
performance as John Fitzgerald,whose icy eyes are peeled away by Hardy
to reveal a blood-drenched psychopath,with each gruff line Hardy drags
out displaying Fitzgerald's complete lack of soul.Taking on the role
with a seriousness which led to him eating raw animal meat (despite
being vegetarian) and sleeping inside an animal carcass, Leonardo
DiCaprio gives an extraordinary performance as Glass,thanks to DiCaprio
keeping the memory of Glass's son buried right at the centre of his
heart,which stays burning as every other piece of Glass's heart is
ripped,chewed and spat out,with DiCaprio making each of Glass's shaky
steps hit the ground like concrete,as Glass begins his walk for
revenge.

To start with, a movie like this should be viewed multiple times to
understand and absorb the little details the director tries to reveal.
Every landscape shot, every breath exhaled, every bite taken, is all
done in such a way that it flows like poetry.The plot is fairly simple, but it is the journey our hero has to
undergo to seek redemption that grabs the viewers attention and demands
all of it. The acting is almost perfect. The question is, what does DiCaprio has
to do to get an Oscar? The director injects a little bit of mysticism in many scenes that have
underlying themes that somehow relate to what the hero is going
through.The movie is two and a half hours long but the time flies by because
the editing compliments the story.Other aspects also help to make to make this movie great.Go see it!

It is one of the most beaten clichés of movie-marketing to call in the
viewer to experience something unusual. When in truth there are very
few filmmakers who are able to pull off something like a sensory
cinematic experience. Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu is one of those rare directors. His movies
defy narrative conventions ("21 Grams", "Babel") and also visual
templates ("Birdman"). Now he has achieved his next big step. A big
budget adventure story that is reduced to its most minimal
plot-elements while being a truly immersive experience that manages to
give a tangible sense of a long-gone era.Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a tracker who assists a band of
fur-trappers in the early nineteenth century. He is attacked by a bear
along the frontier of Montana. And after being left for dead finds
himself amidst an unforgivable wilderness. The screenplay written by Mark L. Smith and Iñárritu is a starting
point for a film that relies first and foremost on the image and is
therefore reconnecting with the era of silent film and the most
fundamental roots of the medium. Iñárritu who tried to avoid as much as
possible the trappings of computer effects has production designer Jack
Fisk, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, costume designer Jacqueline
West and his actors pull out all the stops. You are left with images,
sounds, faces and languages that force you to reflect on your life two
hundred years after the events shown here.Leonardo DiCaprio manages, not unlike Tom Hanks in "Cast Away", to hold
the screen with his presence in a performance that is mostly wordless.
From teen-heartthrob to superstar to character actor; DiCaprio's
trajectory seems to be about choosing his projects according to the
challenges they face. And it must be said that his devotion to the
portrayal of an archaic character whose prime motivation is survival is
as simple and riveting as can be.Before he began shooting "Birdman" Iñárritu sent his cast an image of
Philipp Petit, the high-wire artist who walked between the towers of
the World Trade Center. It was a symbolic gesture of what he and his
collaborators were trying to attempt with their movie. "The Revenant"
represents another high-wire act by this Mexican iconoclast. It is a
successful attempt to resurrect not only a forgotten time, but also
some often neglected qualities of cinema.May it jolt all those timid formula-makers out of their slumber.

Hours of emptiness and snow , i sincerely demand a refund on the lost
time. This movie is waaaaay to loooong. Where should i start. First
thing , Di Caprice should have died ten times before the end of the
movie. Being mauled by a damn grizzly nearly to death and he survived.
He was left for dead in a hole while it's freezing , still he survives.
Swimming in cold water and not dying of hypothermia , CHECK. Falling
from 45 feet cliff without dying CHECK. Left again by the Indian with
rotten flesh and not dying CHECK. OK now you begin to think there is
some action in this movie. In fact that's the only piece of action
you'll get. They filled the rest of the movie with scene of nature from
far . I really loved seeing DI Caprice walk for like 5 minutes without
any action. Naaah i'm joking it was boring as F. You add to that some
Indian gibberish , a lot of vision of his wife flying above him and you
get the revenant. It is true that revenir means come back in french.
And i going to be very hard to get back from the trauma of boredom that
this movie inflicted to me. Last thing : with these kind of weapons,
it's just impossible to shoot someone from 110 yard . If you don't want
to get boredom , choose something else to watch.

This movie reminds me why "Cape Fear", "Gladiator", and "Cast Away" are
great and this one not. The first half hour is crowded with fight
scenes and bear attacks which are so brutal that making the remaining 2
hours quite boring. Look at Cape Fear and see how Robert De Niro revenges his anger on Nick
Nolte (the lawyer betrays him). Look at Gladiator and see how the
images of the dead wife of Russell Crowe come and go with his fate. Tom
Hanks in Cast Away also shows how one man survives in extreme
conditions. The Revenant tries to put these elements into one but fail to be
resonant. You either go deeper in Leonardo's history and his dead wife
memories and reveal his past, or spend more time and climax on
Leonardo's revenge to his fellows. The final duel between Leonardo and
Tom Hardy is not fulfilling given the bloody opening. Leonardo and Tom Hardy are great actors, still cannot save the movie.
The survival part is simply too long, and the revenge part is too
little and too late. My stars are for the actors only.

I must say that DiCaprio is continuously over the topTo explain the least  Mr. Glass, DiCaprio's character, is a strong
source material. But to be able to deliver such a performance, you have
to not only dedicate all your strength and stamina, but also have a
huge talent  something which Leonardo has in abundance. Combining this
with Inarritu's perfect directing skills and Lubezki's paranormal
filming abilities  this one had to be the best of the year.And indeed it is  the struggle between man and nature, the vengeance
trip, the human relationships, the environmental message  we all see
that in its entire run. I must admit that the rawness of the shots were
a bit too much at some times for me, but this indeed made the movie
true to the real life of these people at that time and at that place.The music is by Ryuichi Sakamoto and I strongly recommend it to every
open soul which desires to hear something new and vibrant. The costumes
are profoundly adequate and the narrative is rich with pristine
survival instincts.But the main character in this film is the nature itself. No matter if
we speak about the snow, the trees, the bear or the wind itself  this
is what really shakes the viewer in his seat. I purposely didn't pay
much attention to the dialogue, but rather enjoyed the "conversations"
between Glass and his environment. His journey is delicately decorated
with flashbacks and dreamlike visions which explain not only the
personal story of the character, but also his urge to finish this
journey and do what he has to do.The movie is long enough for you to be able to immerse in the setting,
so take your time and don't rush to deduct or explain it. There will be
plenty of reasons to do that in the next years which I am sure will
prove it to be a classic.

The man on that very trip is Hugh Glass. This first paragraph is to
give everyone a heads up as to what they should expect going in to this
movie. For starters don't be expecting a action film, this is far from
an action film. There are many down moments and many periods of time
with little dialogue, if you are easily bored beware. Now on to the
review of the movie.The first and foremost thing I will talk about is the cinematography. I
swear to you that this film houses some of the best camera work I have
seen in a movie, not to mention the difficulty of shooting in natural
light on top of the tricky and great shots that they pulled off. The
first battle scene between the Arikara and the fur trappers was filled
with many great shots, not just long shots but very maneuverable shots.
If this film doesn't take the Oscar home for best cinematography I
would be very surprised. Hats off to Emmanuel Lubezki for he truly is a
master of his craft and is on the top of his game in this one. It truly
is a shame however that the score is unable to enter into the Oscar
race, the way it pairs with the visuals work quite well. When it comes
to the more intense scenes a very heart jolting percussive tune joins
with it, in the smaller more beautiful moments of scenery are
accompanied with a more orchestral type music. The music works quite
well and I wished it could of at least of gotten a Oscar nod.Although I have stated this film isn't a action film it does have some
very very well executed action sequences, the first encounter between
the Arikara and the fur trappers was great. If you have scene the
trailers you already know what I'm talking about. Another one would be
when Hugh is running from the Arikara on a horse, and if you have seen
the 50 second clip you know what I'm talking about. That is something
that bothers me though is how they pack the trailer full of action and
get viewers expecting something different that what is actually given,
on top of that baiting a demographic that would most likely be
disappointed. If you want to see the movie for the action you have the
trailer and the clip which gives you almost all the action that is in
the film. This film is about the journey Hugh Glass goes through and it
portrays it without any sugar coating and in the end pays off quite
well.The performances are very good as well. Tom Hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio
are practical shove ins for nominations, I don't however think either
one will win but would be pleasantly surprised if either one won. In
conclusion the film is ultimately good but isn't for the action hungry,
it is very technically well made and practically a guaranteed win for
cinematography. The film wasn't as entertaining as I was hoping it
would be and it may overstay its welcome a little long but the film
quality doesn't disappoint, I would rate it an 8.5/10, thanks for
reading my review and I hope you can enjoy the film.

One problem I've had with Hollywood movies is that they constantly look
the same . Primary colours to the fore while action scenes are overly
edited and other intensified continuity technique to the point you're
watching a MTV trailer rather than a action sequence . Add to this just
about every film nowadays must feature Tom Hardy and you're in danger
of exclaiming "If you've seen one film in the 21st Century you've seen
them all" . On top of that THE REVENANT is directed by Alejandro
Gonzalez Inarritu who made the overrated and painfully esoteric BIRDMAN
from last year and this movie seemed like more typical Osccar bait
material so I went in with low expectations and came out pleasantly
surprised !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! Apologies for using the word "pleasantly" in the last paragraph because
this isn't a pleasant film in anyway and this is in no way a criticism
. If you're going to see THE REVENANT simply because it stars Leonardo
PrettyBoy don't say you weren't warned because I'm warning you now .
This is THE NAKED PREY for the 21st Century and whereas Cornell Wilde's
film was slightly hamstrung as to what it could get away with in 1966
the studio system has moved on and not much is held back . If you think
four legged mammals are cute and shouldn't be used as a food source
then again avoid this film like he plague because it'll give you
nightmares . That said it was the bipeds of this movie that gave me
nightmaresMexican director Inarritu really does something special with this movie
and makes a truly cinematic film . I've disliked his previous work but
does something memorable here . The initial Indian attack is shocking
probably because it doesn't contain the usual Hollywood hallmarks of
close-ups and quick edits and is genuinely shocking . He also films a
bear attack that had me falling out of my seat gasping "How'd he do
that ? " because it looks like it was done in one take with a star
actor , not a stuntman , being savaged by a real bear . Indeed I never
got the sensation I was watching a bunch of actors appearing in a movie
which is miraculous considering the big name prolific cast but real
characters trying to survive the twin cruelties of the natural world
and human nature . Also worthy of great praise is the cinematography by
Emmanuel Lubezki which gives the scenes a cold , stark look perfectly
capturing the environment it's set in . The editing by Stephen Mirrione
shouldn't be overlooked either and several scenes feature characters
finding themselves underwater but it's done so seamlessly like the bear
attack it's easy to forget how much hard graft went in to realising
these scenes The film isn't without the occasional flaw . Inarritu overplays his
hand sometimes and the art-house credentials are a bit overdone . Also
because of the material of a solitary figure trapped in a hostile
landscape the story does run out of steam a bit towards the end . There
was also something else I noticed and that is Hugh Glass constantly has
the ability to make fire . I'm guessing he has a piece of flint on him
but surely the landscape is too cold and wet to find effective kindling
material ? Whatever . But these are minor flaws . That said I do notice
a lot of negative comments on this page and I wonder if the people
making them are disappointed in what they got rather than what they
thought they were getting ? As it stands I found THE REVENANT a brutal
and compelling story of real life survival and have no shame in saying
it's the most impressive film of the year so far . I expect it to sweep
the board at this year's Oscars' and deservedly so

I am not a big fan of Inarritu's films. I hated Birdman and i found
some of his previous films very pompous and tedious. But this, this is
a masterpiece. Watch it for the photography. Watch it for the
choreography. Inarritu takes his time with every scene, but i could not
think of anything that should be left out, everything's in its right
place.An overall amazing cinematic experience.Poetic, violent, harsh, bold
cinema. DiCaprio is as usual excellent in a different role than his
previous filmography. Nothing remotely similar comes to mind in the way
this story is shot and told. Stunning!

Forget the hype likely brought to you by those who think the Batman
films are high art with religious overtones.This is a silly, over the top, confused, ugly slog that is often
laughable. The opus opens with dimwitted trappers in the Rocky
Mountains, circa 1820 or so, being attacked by Indians. Rather than
take shelter or even lay down to fire back at the arrow shooting
Indians, the trappers mill around offering good targets for said
Indians who pick off maybe half of their number. The trappers decide to
split the scene after a bit and that's that with that for a while. Along the way home, one of their number gets attacked by a remarkably
ineffective grizzly bear. Now the bear has an open season on this guy,
bites him a dozen times, mauls him repeatedly yet doesn't kill him
which should get the bear the ursine Oscar for the worst performance by
a bear in a supporting role. The boys face a confused crisis - do the trappers stay around waiting
for the guy to recover or continue to flee a bunch of lackadaisical
Indians who may be vaguely sauntering after them at a leisurely pace?
They split the difference delegating a subcommittee to hang out while
the majority flee. When the subcommittee withdraws from their nursing
duties, the mauled guy gives chase. So here's a guy who should be dead but he endures more on his trek back
than most hale and hearty humans can take. I won't list them all but
check this one out. He flees some Indians who may be the the attackers
or maybe not (there are many factions none of which are clear) by
taking a long swim in a partly frozen river. Huh? The passengers who hit the water at the Titanic sinking lasted maybe 45
seconds. In water of similar temperatures, this half dead baby faced
actor lasts hours emerging no worse for wear. Well, why not. Anybody
who can stand up to a sustained grizzly bear attack must view a few
hours swim in near frozen water nothing more than refreshing. Along the way he manages to steal the world's first and maybe only
repeating flintlock pistol. These smooth-bore arms are universally tack
driving accurate. One guy uses his musket to pick off a rider over 200
m away while our baby faced frozen trapper has no trouble making a 50 m
offhanded shot from his galloping horse hitting a rider on another
galloping horse. Camp Petty calls these guys. In the end, the thing wraps up with more Indians wandering on set to
fulfill a prophecy of baby face's now dead wife and although he gets
stabbed a few more times, he remains doing just ducky. Grim, confused, miserable and at parts laughable - today's high art.

The Revenant is the first film since director Alejandro Gonzalez
Innaritu's Birdman triumph. This time around, he brings along Leonardo
DiCaprio playing the 1820's frontiersman Hugh Glass fighting for
survival through perseverance and the seething feeling of revenge
against his former comrade John Fitzgerald played by Tom Hardy after
his grave betrayal of leaving him for dead with nothing else to live
for.Let's start with the flaws people may wanna know about before watching
this film. To start, it's 2 hours and 36 minutes long, meaning that
certain scenes do take long to get through the story and includes
various scenes of hallucinations that one could very much watch without
and throughout the film, there isn't a consistent tone employed which
can draw you away from certain scenes compared to others.But aside from those negatives, this is one of the most beautiful,
violent, and gut wrenching movies you will ever see in your life. The
cinematography is at its finest with 2 time Oscar winner Emmanuel
Lubeski maybe going 3 for 3, if you know what I mean. The direction and
acting is at it's most impeccable. Some of the scenes are such
cinematic achievements that we are left with our jaws dropped as to how
it was so well handled and crafted. An astonishing film that will make
you think and appreciate life and will make you never want to look at
nature, wildlife, and bears the same way ever again. Definite watch for
those wanting some competition for the upcoming awards season.

This is my review of The Revenant (spoiler free).Cast: six time Academy Award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, Academy Award
nominee Tom Hardy*, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter.Plot: Hugh Glass (DiCaprio)is a frontiersman out an adventure with his
team in their fight for survival in the bitter landscape. When the
unthinkable happens Glass' life is in the balance.Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu (Birdman, 2014) over the period of
five years in harsh conditions, this film literally changes the history
of filming. Let me go through some points on why I think this is the
film of the year:Performances: The performances throughout are all Oscar-worthy,
especially considering that this is the first film with Leonardo
DiCaprio, since The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The performances are
exceptional throughout and they didn't come out of character one single
bit.Story: The story of the film keeps intact throughout regarding the
length of the film. The director knew what story he wanted to do and he
stayed with it.Lighting: There was no studio used to make this picture it was entirely
around nature. The use of natural light in this film is the real
clincher. The director didn't use any artificial light to take away the
landscape.Atmospheric landscapes: This film is set in the American wilderness and
was filmed in Calgary, Alberta. The acting isn't the only thing that
makes the film,it is the beautifully atmospheric polar landscapes, from
the vast forests to the incredible mountain ranges this film literally
has it all. All in all this is the film of the year and I completely recommend it
without regret, and I would go through the flaws at this point but
there aren't any this film is flawless. Even though DiCaprio doesn't
say that much I hope he wins the Oscar. 10/10 pure excellence, a must
see.*Best performance by a supporting actor The Revenant (2015).

I really don't like giving 10/10 points, because almost every film
could be better in some way. Put simple: this one couldn't get better.Quite the easy storyline packed in breathtaking pictures, dramatic
scenes and heart-stopping moments.DiCaprio and the producers managed to make you feel the pain, the
hunger, make you feel uncomfortable, cold and hurt in your comfy seat.
It makes you want to give the actor on the screen a warm blanket.The movie pulls you into the harsh wilderness, shows you the beauty and
horror of untouched nature.This, by far is my best movie 2014. It should get an Oscar, but even if
not, DiCaprio can be proud of doing his best work yet.

Seems like G. Iñárritu didn't have enough attention with his previous
film "Birdman", because he came up with an angrier, stronger and more
daring masterpiece."The Revenant" is based on the true story of American explorer Hugh
Glass, who was left for dead after being attacked by a bear and later
seeks for revenge.First, Leonardo DiCaprio. This is possibly his best role to date, you
can see how he has matured as an actor, every minute he's on the screen
he shows us human instincts beyond his own limits. Tom Hardy is also a
great addition as the main antagonist.I'm not going to spoil anything, but the storyline is good as well
(even if it's not 100% accurate). The script and characters were
superbly developed and the pacing was well-crafted. The bear scene is
one of the best sequences I've seen in a long time. Every shot of the
film is given by huge technical effort. Finally, the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is another Oscar-
worthy work. Using nothing but natural light, the image of the film is
sometimes beautiful and sometimes haunting."The Revenant" is one of the best films of the year, with a well-
written script, intense and visceral sequences, and an excellent
cinematography. This gives DiCaprio, Iñárritu and Lubezki another shot
for the Awards Season.

Odyssey in literature equals to the calvary of homecoming. Odyssey
means fulfillment either by knowledge, sacrifice or mercy. There are
great examples of fulfillment by knowledge in 2001: A Space Odyssey as
well as we can find heroic sacrifice and redemption by vengeance in
Gladiator, however in Homer's Odyssey the latter fulfillment is
achieved by justice and mercy.Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant takes a great courage from
the real life Odysseus' trials and tribulations based on the novel of
the same name. Needless to say, Iñárritu reaches higher than the novel
by envisioning a cinematically unique and unsettlingly fulfilling
experience alongside with the exceptional imagination of
cinematographer Emmanuel 'Chivo' Lubezki and a huge amount of excellent
performances from a most talented cast.From the characters, there are three prominently mentionable. Domhnall
Gleeson is brilliantly temperate in order for the two main characters
to deepen their opposition with each other. Tom Hardy serves as the
picture's main antagonist with whom Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass is
forced to confront followed by a tragic decision in the part of Hardy
who kills Glass' half-blood Indian son while his father is watching the
act impotently lying wounded by a previous attack of a bear. This great
inner and outer duel of the two is slowly but constantly reaching its
peak as Hardy's Fitzgerald learns to deal with his deed, while Leo's
Glass learns a much greater deal.Hugh Glass does not only seek revenge. He seeks justice. Frontier
justice. Glass learns to survive in the wild as was he viciously left
for dead and devastated. He is forced to flee from the past and the
wild in order to fulfill his destiny in killing Fitzgerald. Such an
unprecedented Odyssey we can experience as Glass learns mercy on his
journey as well as sacrifice and justice! Leonardo DiCaprio solidly
delivers his greatest and most memorable performance in his career. He
captures and evolves on every aspect of his character which is
absolutely Oscar-worthy.The scenery is marvelous. The costume design is most convincing. The
makeup artists did an amazing job. The editing and mixing are no less
award-worthy than the beautiful visuals and the masterful vision of
Chivo. The long takes are breathtakingly intense from start to finish,
from the opening Indian attack sequence that leaves us uncertain who to
root for, through to a naturalist and unbelievably convincing depiction
of the bear attack, to the brutally mesmerizing and well- executed
final confrontation between Fitzgerald and Glass. These two actors both
deserve their praise for their most committed performances as they make
us believe that on the screen it is not Hardy and Leo fighting, but two
hopeless, barbaric, opposing elements who learn to rise and fall in the
wild. All those thought-provoking visual and external oppositions claim for
re-watching owing to the film's splendid screenplay in which the
conflicts (American-Indian; Fitzgerald-Glass; conflict of elements) are
so layered that from the first viewing one may not be able to fully
process what they might have just experienced.

An exceptional work by Dicaprio and team. Way better than Star wars,
hoping this performance may get Leo Oscar. Fingers crossedIt would be unfair to judge every movie which has ever been made before
Alejandro G. Iñárritu's THE REVENANT in comparison to it. That said,
THE REVENANT may indeed be the best.Overall, The Revenant is an incredible journey into the capacity of the
human spirit and with it can endure. Inarritu and his cinematographer
Lubezki have crafted a film unlike anything I have ever seen and with a
performance as deeply constructed as DiCaprio it's definitely an
experience I will not forget. I am going to give it a 10/10.

First of all the description of ''The Revenant'' makes you all excited
and ready for an adventure epic western drama thriller. Inarritu's decision to shoot the film chronologically was a good call
telling the story from the beginning to the end. His ability and
follow- up to Birdman does not disappoint. The amazing shots of every
scene, every breath of Glass, every fight, struggle, survival on set
makes him one of the greatest of all time. Definitely after this I'm
going to watch more of his work. DiCaprio DiCaprio DiCaprio... where to begin? He has definitely proved
once and for all who runs this. The pain that he reflects, the scene
with the bear the screaming, the scars and hope to make it another day,
horse scene where he sleeps on his carcass to the fight scenes and
eating real bison liver he really committed to this performance. He
wasn't playing Glass - HE WAS GLASS. There is not enough words from the
training and prepare of mastering guns, western lifestyle, the look to
the accent and rawness of his character he topped Wolf of Wall Street
and that was some of his best work congrats man hats off to you.Tom Hardy's performance wasn't unnoticed. He showed us one more ti how
well he can manage to play a supporting character and that he's good at
it unfortunately Leo's performance I think it shadowed him but there's
a great possibility he'll grab an Oscar nomination for Supporting
Actor.Will Poulter's performance as a scary trying to be honest but coward
was just another point to making the film complete. I waited for this film almost 2 years to come out and see it ever since
it was announced. Don't Miss it cause there's not enough space for me
to write a well-deserved review for this . 10/10 and I'm sure it's
gonna win at least 5 Oscars ;) .

Finally a movie worth writing a review about, I give this movie 10
stars for the following reasons. The acting was stellar, Leonardo and
tom's best acting thus far. The cinematography is absolutely
breathtaking, you actually feel like you're there, you can almost smell
the ice and mud. I felt transported back to the 1800's. This story is
about frontiersman, Hugh Glass, who get's gravely injured and left for
dead by his comrades. What comes next is a tale of survival, tears,
pain and the ultimate revenge , What a combo!From beginning to end I was at the edge of my seat. I even caught
myself holding my breath a few times. There are a few scenes not for
the feint of heart so children beware! I foresee many Oscars for this
one. BRAVO!!!

The Revenent(2015) is directed by Alejandro G Inarritu. Starring
Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hardy, Domnhall Gleeson and Will Poulter. This
movie was one of my most anticipated. Inarritu who just finished
Birdman(2014) is making a movie about Hugh Glass. Damn the movie is
gonna be sick. And also starring Jordan Belfort, Bane and General Hux
this movie is going to be the best ever. After I watched The Revenent,
I was both disappointed and happy. Lets talk about the good first. The
movie was shot extremely beautifully. The cinematography was flawless
Emmanuel Lubezki will be getting his third Oscar in a row. Leo, I like
you. I want you to win an Academy awards and I think you probably gonna
win best actor this year. His performance was exceptional. His
performance was very physical not all dialogy. I don't think it was his
best role though you know his performance in The Wolf of Wall Street
was better. Leo, you were fantastic. Tom Hardy was good. Domnhall
Gleeson was very good. Inarritu direction was great as always. The bear
scene. The bear scene was amazing. My mind was blown. IT was so
beautifully shot and the acting was excellent. The CGI of the bear
looks very realistic. Now its time to get to the bad. It was too long
(2 hr 36 min!). The movie had some very unnecessary scene. The subplot
wasn't too convincing. In conclusion, I was a little bit disappointed
with The revenent. I thought that Birdman was a better picture. The
film was shot extreemly beautiful though. The ensemble cast was great.
SOlid 8 this is.

The Revenant is one of the most beautifully shot movies I have ever
seen. The opening scene alone will make you wonder how the hell they
did this. There are so many creative shots with sweeping camera angles
and beautiful vistas. For that alone I'd recommend seeing it.As the story goes, its based on true event. The real story of Hugh
Glass is an incredible story about the will to survive and the need for
revenge. The Revenant portrays that very well. At times it's brutal,
savage, and unforgiving, like what frontier life was probably like in
the early 19th century.The acting is all well done, from Dicaprio as the lead to Hardy as the
villain; they were all convincing. The only knock I have about this
movie is the pacing and length. I knew going in being familiar with the
story that there were going to be slow parts, a wounded man clinging to
life and traveling through the wilderness was bound to have slow parts.Visually alone, I think most cinemaphiles will have a lot to like about
this movie as well for people who are interested in the the time
period. This film is certainly well made and the fact that they used
only natural lighting adds to the already impressive production values.

(No Spoilers Here)Honestly I am astonished at the lower ratings this film is getting, are
you kidding me! Right off the bat in the beginning I could tell this
film was going to be something special. First off the Direction from Alejandro González Iñárritu, and
cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki is some of the greatest film work
I have ever seen! The way the camera moves throughout the film is
unparalleled. The feeling immerses you into the film that uses nature
as its main star. Definitely see The Birdman duo getting a 2nd straight
Oscar nod this year!As for the acting, yes everyone asking will this film finally get Leo
his first Oscar? I can honestly say for now yes! The reason I say for
now, is because there is still a few months up to the Oscars and I am
sure more films will arise as contenders, but for the time now, I
personally haven't seen a performance that betters Leo's Hugh Glass for
The Revenant this year. What he offers in this film is shear acting! If
there is a better performance for an actor this year, please by all
means tell me, because this will be hard to top people!That being said I believe there will be another actor nominated for his
performance in this film as well. Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, Tom was
superb as the frontiersman and in my opinion definitely deserves a nod. The plot is a pretty straight forward revenge story, but never the less
the amazing acting, direction, camera work, and natural capture of a
extreme cold wasteland will immerse the viewer into a film I think is
unlike anything ever seenI give this film a 9/10 and as always enjoy the show!

The Revenant's story is flat and difficult to accept as realistic or
mythic. It may be magic realism but that doesn't make this particular
story an effective narrative- its strengths lie in the visual trip it
takes you on. However, what story it does have ruins that visual trip,
unlike in the best works of Malick or Tarkovsky, where the natural
imagery and the dreaminess better compliment the narrative, and
vice-versa.It's not realistic, despite being 'based' on a true story, because it
keeps the main character alive past all biological possibility. (For
those who would quibble with the 'true story' factor, the actual story
of Hugh Glass doesn't have the main character defy death ten times
over. Furthermore it's a 'true story' of a mountain man doing something
extraordinary. This usually means it's a tall tale.)And if Glass' death-defiance is meant to subtly show the main character
as a kind of undead or supernatural being (or ambiguously or liminally
so), that idea is not developed interestingly. Even worse, if Glass'
endurance and death-defiance are supernatural, then his determination
is irrelevant and the theme seems to be: 'family love powers magic
revenge'. That's an F for story to me. I suppose that there could be
some sort of grand allegorical meaning, but since the story doesn't
work on the literal level, that potential is irrelevant to me.Although others may see it differently, the highest score I can give a
narrative film with a zero for story is a 3 out of 10. I find it sadly
amusing that after Birdman, with its examination of the perils of ego,
Inarritu follows with an egomaniacal stunt of his own.

The Revenant, first of all, is beautiful. Technically perfect, and it's
an Oscar lock for cinematography. I think this IS obvious so I'm not
going to talk much about that. Acting is mostly great. Leo surprised me
with great showing of emotions despite lack of dialogue (although he
needs to practice subtlety just a tiny bit more). Tom Hardy gave a good
performance. Gleeson IMO was the only weak link, which surprised
me...he felt a bit miscast and out of focus (he DID make 4 movies this
year, so...). Inarritu and George Miller (Mad Max) are currently
frontrunners for Best Director. The Revenant is great thanks to
Inarritu's ability to make a great looking, very well paced film. Some
would argue that the 2nd act is too slow, maybe pretentious. I am not
one of those people, but I understand the criticism. It does come down
to a simple survival (if you want to simplify) in that part, but the
way it was handled was near perfect. I don't see the possible
improvement there. If you expected a more action packed film, you
watched the wrong film. Revenant is not about that, at all. Although it
pumps up some adrenaline during the bear attack scene and the climax of
the film, it's primarily about our central character who overcomes the
impossible and whose pain we feel with every minute of the movie.
That's the strongest part of it, that pain we feel with our hero. It's
rare to see a movie this wonderful when its plot can be simplified as a
survival revenge flick. But, as I mentioned, it's so much more than
that and it is definitely a future classic. This movie WILL be
extremely polarizing, as Birdman also was. But I think the greatest
films are very polarizing. The last shot of the movie made me love it
even more. I can't think of a specific reason, but that's my brain, I
guess.In the end, The Revenant is a masterfully crafted survival film.
Definitely recommended.

I have no intention repeating what other reviewers have said about this
film, but I do want to chime in with an often overlooked aspect of The
Revenant - cinematography.First of all, the whole film is shot on digital 65mm Arri camera with
not a single medium or telephoto lens. Everything is shot with wide
angle lenses and the framing is done basically by moving the camera
either further away or very, very close to the main actors.This super-close framing combined with wide angle lenses creates an
incredible immersive effect, where you simply cannot help but
physically feel the cold, the water, the dirt, the blood splatter, the
nature. Many times during the movie the lens itself gets splashed in
blood or dirt, it fogs up from the breath of the protagonists or even
gets kicked during fight scenes. Also, the faces are so close they get
distorted from the wide-angle lenses, which in turn creates an even
greater effect of honesty. There are no masterfully lit beauty shots
here. Instead, it's all very, very, very rough and very real.Also, the movement of the camera is incredible. The huge sweeping
360-degree vistas right in the middle of massive combat scenes create
the effect of the viewer being "in the middle of action", it is almost
as if you're turning your head to look around. The fact that the whole
movie is made with only natural light is an interesting factoid, but
it's important because the DoP Emmanuael Lubezki suddenly isn't
confined in his framing by where the artificial lights are placed. He's
free to move any where and any way he wants and that sense of liberty
is definitively something we don't get to see very often.Every one of these visual aspects add a new layer of authenticity and
what you end up with is an incredible movie that can almost be
described as "an experience". It's a ride that's hard to forget and is
certainly something that anyone interested in film-making is going to
want to take a good, hard look into.

This is the best film of 2015 by about 200 miles, and the best frontier
epic I've seen in 25 years. It isn't dissimilar to 1990's Dances With
Wolves, but The Revenant is a story that actually happened (or close to
it) and the minor liberties taken with the source all make sense when
you read about the saga as it was documented, and are totally justified
when you see the end result.Tom Hardy is having quite a year. Mad Max: Fury Road was the best film
I had seen this year until this one came along, and despite how good he
was as the lead/hero, his portrayal of a totally corruptible villain is
far better, and is the best performance in the movie in my opinion.Fortunately for DiCaprio, Hardy isn't competing with him as the lead
actor here and while Hardy's performance is extremely dialog-driven,
Leo's is the exact opposite. Within the first half-hour he's almost
entirely lost the use of his voice and spends the remaining 2 hours
illustrating that acting is as much about line delivery as about facial
expression and body language.A couple of the more minor casting and crewing decisions seemed strange
when I first read about them, particularly Domnhall Gleeson in the role
of the Army Captain and Ryuichi Sakamoto's appointment to create the
score. I've never seen Gleeson play any masculine characters in a
convincing fashion but he does it extremely well here, and although
Sakamoto created two outstanding film scores for 'Merry Christmas Mr.
Lawrence' and 'The Last Emperor' they were both in the mid 1980's. He's
worked with Inarritu before but this is his best work since he won the
academy award in 1987 and the best film score I've heard all year. He
had some assistance with this one, which seems to be a roadblock to his
getting a nomination for this movie, which is a shame.On the topic of awards, DiCaprio and Hardy certainly deserve their
probable nominations, but I think The Revenant has a better chance at
snagging the two sound design Oscars (particularly the one for sound
mixing) and the award for best cinematography. The latter is, for me,
the biggest lock of the year in a year where many will be rooting for
DiCaprio as much during awards season as they do for his character in
the film.Emmanuel Lubezki has again delivered the most beautiful film of the
year, and has included quite a few of his usual impressive camera
tricks. Visually and thematically The Revenant evokes 2005's The New
World, and in addition to the same amazing imagery he captured in that
film, this one is a technical jaw-dropper. There are several long-take
action scenes that owe as much of their impact to the visual effects
and choreography teams as they do to Lubezki's camera but he's the one
who brings it all together. To win the Oscar again would be his third
win in a row and provide some tangible support for my feeling that he's
the greatest film photographer in the world and possibly the best one
ever. No one has won the award more than four times and the two men who
did win four took an average fourteen nominations to get there. Lubezki
has two wins from just seven nominations in a relatively short 32-year
career behind the lens.The Revenant is the type of movie that I had to take notes for because
by the time the credits rolled I had forgotten at least a couple of the
technical puzzle-pieces that combined to make it so great. Nominations
for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Makeup
and Best Editing would all be deserved in addition to those mentioned
above. I would not be surprised to see the film enter February with as
many as 10 Oscar nominations. The combined efforts of about a half
dozen of the most talented artists and technicians in the business are
at play here. 10 out of 10 starts; one of the most beautiful films
about ugliness you'll ever see.

Alejandro G. Inarritu's The Revenant is a 19th century western drama
that brings the most gritty, realistic, and brutal take I've seen. The
Revenant follows Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he battles the
elements and native inhabiter's to avenge a loss committed by nemesis
John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). The Revenant pushes the limits of
cinematography and tells one of, if not the most gripping film of the
year. Emmanuel Lubezki created a lived in and natural world. I saw the
beautifully shot scenic scenes and the first-person like tracking
shots, but more importantly I could FEEL them. An edge will grip any
viewer and with environmental shots alone i felt genuinely frightened
of this unknown wilderness. The bright orange sparks from fires, the
dark blue skies, and the black trees that laid on top of the bare white
ground were real, they were unforgiving and beautiful. Leonardo DiCaprio gives in my opinion, the best performance of his
career. For the first time i wasn't watching DiCaprio, I wasn't
watching a man with a malice heart, I was joining Hugh Glass on his
vicious struggle for revenge. Tom Hardy has been a busy man but he
seemingly cannot stop giving great performances with rather rare
dialogue. Hardy becomes his best villain (thats saying something
especially for Hardy). Hardy delivers a character we hate from the very
beginning giving a untrustworthy, selfish, and genuinely dirty man
life. Domhnall Gleeson (Andrew Henry) and Will Poulter (Bridger) both
give great performances. Poulter breaks out of his typical comedic
acting to give a surprising but magnificent performance, one of the
best young actors today. Although the film was inducing and beautiful its script at sometimes
fell flat for me. Dialogue at times felt out of its time and a bit too
staged but this problem is overlaid by terrific acting, cinematography,
and camera direction. Birdman's mind-blowing continuing long-takes are
very present in this film creating the most edgy and again realistic
scenes I've seen in film. The Revenant has everything Inarritu did
perfectly in Birdman and corrected mistakes made in previous films.
This film is entrancing but artistic film lovers will fall in love with
this film like they did with all of Inarritu's past work. The Revenant
pushes every single aspect and limit in filmmaking while delivering a
totally unique experience because of this, The Revenant is a excellent
film.

From the award winning director of last years Birdman comes this
engrossing film that in my opinion will finally land DiCaprio his first
Oscar and man does he earn it. This movie is beautifully shot with what
appears to be natural lighting. You almost feel the Calgary chill in
your bones. The film is based on Hugh Glass who is left for dead by his
men after being mauled by a bear which is truly stunningly executed.
The scene is not too short nor too long just perfect and realistic
enough. We witness a man pushed to the brink of his death keep going to
survive led on by his revenge. Tom Hardy is brilliant as opposite
DiCaprio. Its night and day from Birdman so don't expect Leonardo
DiCaprio to be walking through a long hallway talking to himself with
jazz music playing. In fact don't expect him to talk too much. His
acting here is raw and based more on expression and disappearing into
his character. I absolutely loved this movie and everything about it
felt so natural and real. I suggest unlike me you wait to it actually
comes out and witness this in the theaters like it deserves because the
scenery is gorgeous.

The first hour and a half or so of this film is deserving of an 11/10.
This film has some of the best cinematography i have ever seen in my
life. Along with that DiCaprio gives perhaps his best performance of
all time. This is a very visually structured film meaning that there is
very little dialogue and a lot of DiCaprios is in a different language
anyway. The film takes its time and doesn't clog the audience with
excessive exposition. Many complaints on this site are against the
depth of all of the characters but after watching it three times you
begin pick up on the point of the flashbacks. You see what DiCaprio and
this boy went through many years ago and you begin to understand
Dicaprios deep connection with his son. Tom Hardy also gives an
excellent performance as well. He does not have these flashbacks but
that is because the audience can figure out all they need to know about
him through his actions. Hardys character did have a role in which more
dialogue was given and in every sentence he spoke and every move he
made you would begin to dive further and further into the character and
understand the extent of his insanity. There are some quick flashbacks
of Hardys character that I have yet to decipher. The only flaw that i
could find with the movie is that DiCaprio suffers life threatening
injuries one too many times. The first hour and a half is one of the
best movies I've ever seen with the second have being one of the best
films of the year. Phenomenal movie for those who can endure it.

First, let me dispense with the good. The scenery is stunning, vivid,
real; truly awe inspiring. The scenery is committing a faux pau, by
"Chewing the scenery" in this film. Revenant is Inspired by true
events, true events that might have been exciting to children in 1890
perhaps. The true story is yawn inspiring. A 19th century fur collector
is left for dead by his friends after being eviscerated by a bear,
quite reasonably I might add, considering medical technology at the
time. The erstwhile appetizer for a bear is outraged that they took his
gun and kit, so he crawls back to the fort and confronts his former
friends and gets his gun back. No one dies, until a decade later the
Indians finish off where the bear left off. End of story. How exciting,
says my 95 year old Grandfather, who considered watching paint peel
entertainment in 1927. Well.... Hollywood has to spice the story up and make it something more
worthy of Leonardo and Tom. After all both men can and have done solid
work, so certainly they need the plot to have a little more vim and
verve to it. How do you do it? It's tough.... after all in real life
the only homicidal actor in the whole event was the damn bear. So
Hollywood gives Leonardo a son who tags along on his Dad's fur trapping
adventure. Better yet Hollywood lets Tom Hardy eviscerate said son far
more effectively than the bear could Leonardo and as a cherry on top,
let's the helplessly wounded Leonardo watch his son die hard. There you
have it. Leonardo now has the will to live, if only to treat Tom Hardy
to the feast of wounds the bear subjected him to. Thus begins a two
hour epic journey of revenge that leaves you wishing that the bear and
Indians had just killed all the actors at the beginning of the film.
The only truth in the whole movie is spewed by Hardy as he dies, when
he grimly tells Leonardo that killing him won't bring his son back, nor
alas our wasted three hours. In the end I am glad they spiced up the historical events, because as I
said from the start, said historical events were boring and needed some
steroids. However, it's a one dimensional movie dominated by the
scenery and the facial expressions Leonardo and Tom make throughout the
film. We needed more bear....

Title says it all, tied with 2 others for best movie I've seen in a
decade? I do watch them, movies, sometimes, just this one is so vastly
superior. 20/10 I honestly didn't think I'd like it, Mr. DiCaprio isn't
a fav and the premise seemed weak to me, I've lived sorta close to this
kind of experience before, so it's kinda old-hat to me. And then I
watched it twice. I did not waste my time, I had to watch it again, it
was just that good. I do gotta say that the lack of concern about
staying wet and cold bothered me a lot. I got moderate hypothermia one
spring when I was a teen by falling asleep with no blankets or padding
on the floor of a concrete porch at 5-7 Celsius, and the hero goes over
a waterfall series and then floats for what seems like hours, then
doesn't even light a fire and get dry right away before it fades to
black on him? First watch through, I swore he was a gonna, no doubt in
my mind.ANd I still couldn't blink. But the whole cast and crew deserve
an Oscar each, pulling off that level of "I can't take my eyes off it
even to blink" in SPITE of an issue that for me would normally kill my
interest marks this truly one of the best flicks ever. I'm even gonna
push this one on my unsuspecting friends. They'll thank me for it, I'm
sure. ANd I am a very harsh critic who is normally silent, particularly
about this sort of film,but I logged in here just because I had to
comment somewhere about this real modern marvel of the world. Must have
been filmed somewhere near BC, Canada, this looked just like my
backyard 5 years ago, and my experiences were based in a valley coulda
been the one he drinks water from that first time, I honestly couldn't
tell the diff.

Leonardo DiCaprio Himself Said The Revenant his 'most difficult film'
But After Watchig This Movie I Asked Myself "Is There anything this guy
can't do"? Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit
in the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room and watch
protagonists suffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us
can't really comprehend. Too often, these endurance tests feel
manipulative or, even worse, false. We're smart enough to "see the
strings" being pulled, and the actor and set never fades away into the
character and condition. What's remarkable about Alejandro Gonzalez
Iñárritu's "The Revenant" is how effectively it transports us to
another time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece
of visual art. You don't just watch "The Revenant," you experience it.
You walk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the
filmmaking and a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your
life. So My Review 10/10 An extraordinary piece of work by Leo,director
and rest of the cast,Must Watch Guys

I had the opportunity to watch The Revenant at an early press screening
yesterday, and what an exceptional movie this is!You are on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film, Lubezki's
cinematography is out of this world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance
is absolutely riveting and Oscar-worthy. The naturalistic beauty of
17th century America that is visualized in this movie is beyond
anything I've ever experienced in film.Hugh Glasses' story is a legendary one, and they couldn't have honored
his legacy any better than this. Alejandro Iñárritu has outdone himself
once again.

It would be unfair to judge every movie which has ever been made before
Alejandro G. Iñárritu's THE REVENANT in comparison to it. That said,
THE REVENANT may indeed be the best.All of the actors have done exceptional work in this film. Leonardo
DiCaprio's incredible performance truly deserves to be given the
highest honors.The Cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. This film transports the
viewer to the 19th century frontier. The natural landscape and lighting
each play irreplaceable roles of their own.All of the intense suffering depicted in THE REVENANT has the affect of
creating a deeply palpable thirst for hope.As there are no light moments or laughs in this film, relief comes only
from characters who are in a position to be righteous choosing to be
righteous. The characters are neither perfectly good or perfectly evil.
They are perfectly human. The spirituality of the universe feels authentically depicted; absorbed
into the heart it rings truthful. It is perhaps the Best Picture. Ever.

Alexandre Iñárritu did it again! Birdman was an extraordinary film and
Iñárritu followed it up with The Revenant which is a fantastic film! It
has breathtaking cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki which is even
more impressive when you look at the challenge that Iñárritu decided to
tackle: filming it entirely in all natural light. This just added to
the realistic nature to the film and made it visually breathtaking.This film is partly based on true events in the 1820s and stars
Leonardo DiCaprio as a frontiersman named 'Hugh Glass', who is brutally
mauled by a bear leaving him seriously injured and out to get revenge
on Tom Hardy's character 'John Fitzgerald' for something that took
place just after his encounter with the bear.Leonardo DiCaprio gave an outstanding performance showing his
struggles, turmoil, and general survival. His performance was very
visual involving very little spoken words and when it was, it was
mostly another language than English. This has to be one of the best
visual performances I have ever seen from an actor in film, it was
incredible seeing this character go through what he went through!Tom Hardy also gave a brilliant performance as this cowardice,
backstabbing, liar who does a great job at making you show disdain for
the character. Glass and Fitzgerald have a defining scene at one point
in the film showing them fighting against each other with quite a lot
of brutality to the fight that left me on the edge of my seat with its
intense and unsparing nature. I feel that this along with the bear
scene are some of the best from 2015.Now speaking of the bear scene, it will go down as one of the best
scenes in cinema history. It was incredible how realistic and intense
it turned out to be! The CGI on the bear is the best I think I've seen
for an animal: making for an extremely believable bear that I was
finding hard to believe wasn't real! DiCaprio's performance is also one
to be acknowledged for this scene with the pain and desperation of his
actions as he struggles to survive. Extraordinary!However, I did have one issue worth noting and that was a choice of
words towards the climax of the film, I don't want to give anything
away but I feel that was an underwhelming remark within the situation.
But overall this film is fantastic and I would definitely recommend
watching it!

This movie showed amazing cinematography amid majestic settings from
the opening scenes and throughout the movie. With direction of the
photographer following individual characters in the line of battle, the
audience is on the edge of its seat figuring out what is going on from
the start, as Journeyman, Explorer, Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio)
leads a troop of Fur traders cross country along the Northwest (North
Dakota, actual location). This true survival story from the early 1800's made me describe the
movie roughly, as a cross between Jerehmiah Johnson (Robert Redford),
The Patriot (Mel Gibson) and Deliverance(Burt Reynolds). With those
titles, if any of them tripped your trigger, then you will very much
LIKE the Revenant!There are good lessons of character in this movie for which are brought
out in the way the badly injured Glass is treated by his troop after
being viciously mauled by a huge bear. However, it is the vision and
voice of his deceased wife and son that keeps Glass going in hard to
believe scenarios. One of the best movies that I've seen in a long while for this genre.Expect Best Movie, Director, Cinematography and Best Actor nominations
by the Academy.

It was just over a year ago that renowned Mexican director Alejandro
González Iñárritu brought us "Birdman", a fantastic and audacious dark
comedy that deserved every one of it's 4 Oscars which included Best
Picture and Best Director. He's a filmmaker that has built up a
reputation for being very nihilistic and bleak in his approach to his
work, often leaving viewers feeling rather inhospitable. And whilst
"Birdman" was a drastic and welcome change to his style, with "The
Revenant" he has crafted a sprawling, violent and visceral epic that is
an experience like no other.The film is set in the 1820's and follows American frontiersman Hugh
Glass who is mauled by a Grizzly Bear whilst hunting in the frigid,
mountainous landscapes. Left for dead by his fellow hunters and
witnessing his son killed by one of them, he embarks on an agonizing
journey through treacherous winter conditions as he seeks revenge and
justice.The opening sequence sets the tone right from the off, as we're
introduced to Glass through a stunning dream sequence in which his wife
and son are present. Many familiar with Terrence Malick's work will
immediately find semblance in the way a majority of scenes in the film
are put forward; dainty close-ups projecting a wide array of human
expression and emotions, and appreciation of the beautiful nature that
surrounds them. Shot in pure natural light, cinematographer Emmanuel
'Chivo' Lubezki masterfully captures every facet of the awe-inspiring
but harsh exterior which almost feels like a character of it's own. In
a growing list of sublimely lensed films by Lubezki, this may be his
most impressive and personal work to date.DiCaprio has made no secret of the tribulations that he endured making
this movie, going as far as to saying that he almost died a couple of
times. And watching him as Hugh Glass, it's not hard to understand why
it was such a difficult shoot but which I think will ultimately turn
out to be very rewarding. He immerses himself fully into the role,
whether it be crawling on rough terrain, relaying maximal anguish and
pain or trying escape from the glacial waters, it's a role like nothing
he has ever taken on before. It's the perfect example of a part that is
dependent on the actor being able to transmit their character's
identity to the audience in an almost 100% physical manner. DiCaprio
embodies Glass with the utmost devotion and this may finally be his
ticket to long awaited Oscar glory.The rest of the cast also do very solid work. Tom Hardy's intuitive and
fierce charisma jumps off the screen once again as an unhinged and
villainous entity. His disheveled appearance also gave him an extra
layer of cruelness. And Domhnall Gleeson, who's enjoyed a great year,
ends it with another impressive turn as the stout Captain of the
hunting troupe. This is not a film for the faint-hearted; it's savage and austere. Yet
amongst all of the brutality, one cannot ignore the lyrical visual
splendor that is present in every frame. Iñárritu isn't afraid to show
his spiritual hand here; in fact he embraces it. It's a story of
survival. It's a story of one being able to find peace with themselves.
And it's a story of what nature means to our world and how stunning and
savage it can be. "The Revenant" is a spellbinding piece of cinema.

Usually one expects good things from Leonardo DiCaprio, especially when
coupled with the man of the moment Tom Hardy. Whilst they both deliver
stellar performances, dead cert for Oscar nominations, the film itself
is only of an average calibre. For 135 million one expects to see a
dazzling display but the film only displays normal effects, it would
seem that the only reason it cost so much was Iñárritu's insistence on
natural light leading to a much longer than usual filming schedule,
which drastically inflated the budget. We are shown a fighting bear
that is supposed to make for a dramatic scene but the CGI already looks
dated, not to mention unnatural, and I ended up watching the clock for
the scene to be over, as I noticed others doing too. The storyline
itself isn't anything special or that we haven't seen done a million
times before. If Leo and Hardy weren't starring in it I imagine so
called 'critics' would be calling this an average film. The film would
also not break even without their star power.

I've never written a review on this page, but I thought this movie is
worth it. I walked into the cinema with some expectation as to how the
movie would be, but by the end I was completely amazed by the
incredible work of Iñárritu and his crew. The whole cinema was quiet
once the credits started rolling and nobody said a word until they
walked out. The story isn't complicated or hard to follow but at the same time it
is so intense that you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time.
Trying to not reveal any spoilers, there is a part of the movie that
there is no dialogue at all, but it is never boring to watch, you feel
like you're the main character trying to survive. The landscape shots
are amazing and the music is captivating, the acting never disappoints
as all the main characters give great performances.If Leo doesn't get a his well deserved Oscar for this, then I don't
know what he will get it with. Would definitely go to watch it again.
For me it is one of, if not the best movie of 2015.

The Revenant was fantastic. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters.
Movies like this are a truly rare experience.First of all, the obvious. It is a visual and technical masterpiece.
Filmed on location in the wilderness with all natural lighting, this is
one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It truly feels like
you're placed in the American frontier along with the characters. It's
a stunning mix of old, new, and groundbreaking film techniques.The film makers went through hell in order to create as authentic of an
experience as possible. No obvious and glossy CGI special effects here.
Even an avalanche was created for real by detonating explosives in a
mountain. Also, all of the actors fully committed to look and act the
part of hardened wilderness explorers.However, this movie isn't for everyone. This isn't a romanticized
patriotic flick like most Hollywood movies set during America's early
history. It's visceral and savage, examining the relentlessness of
nature and the harsh reality of frontier life. The fight scenes aren't
just set pieces designed to entertain the audience. They're gripping
and absolutely brutal. I've seen bloodier movies, but almost none have
felt this real. It's obvious that a lot of the stunt work was done by
the actors because there are no quick cuts or cheap editing tricks
during the action sequences. Even Tom Hardy, who can be seen pole
vaulting onto vehicles in Mad Max: Fury Road, was concerned about the
safety of some of the stunts he had to perform. That being said, this
is NOT an "action" film. Much time is spent on the captivating
landscapes and quiet moments of being alone in nature.The story is simple. It's about the fight for survival over limited
resources in the wild. It almost feels like a nature documentary
because the people are just another species trying get by. Almost all
violence erupts from the need for self preservation. The bear that
attacks Glass is simply defending it's cubs. And even the villain of
the story is driven by fear, not just because he's the "bad guy". The
acting is all phenomenal. There wasn't a single mediocre performance. I
doubt we'll ever see a film like The Revenant made again.

Let me start by saying that I cannot believe someone actually gave this
wonderful film one star in his review. That tells me that the reviewer
has some sort of grudge for doing this.This movie is what cinema is all about, gripping, captivating and
extremely scary in many parts. I believe this work from the wonderful
director reinvents the adventure/survival/revenge genre. My jaw was on
the floor several times, especially with THAT bear scene. How it was
filmed to be so realistic is a mystery to me. Just wait till you see
it. In all my life I have never seen anything like this, so for someone
to give it a one star review leaves me bewildered and wondering what
goes on in some people's minds. This is a magnificent film and I have
given it ten stars for the amazing experience I had watching it.

Fifteen minutes into the film, right after the Native attack that opens
the story, two people next to me got up and left the theatre. It was
about ten minutes after that that I looked over to my wife, she seemed
bored out of her mind. As the credits rolled, I asked her what she
thought. She went on to list off all her problems with the film, mainly
the length and how 'boring' she found it. I on the other hand, found it
utterly visceral in the unrelenting grittiness that bathed over my
eyeballs. After a vicious bear attack, Hugh Glass is left battered and beaten.
His men try their best to help transport him back to their settlement,
yet the harsh environments and tracking Natives on their heels make it
near impossible. Three men, including his son, decide to stay behind
with him, while the others venture forward. One of those men is
Fitzgerald, who only volunteers due to the promise of extra money when
they return. Fed up with waiting, Fitzgerald takes matters into his own
hands, leaving Glass behind to die. Fueled by revenge, Glass is
determined to stay alive, crawl 200 miles and kill the man responsible
for leaving him in the dirt.There's been a lot of talk about the behind the scenes drama
surrounding this film. Multiple crew members quit mid production over
the shooting conditions, which included harsh cold weather, dangerous
stunts and only using natural light. The trials and tribulations of
those who created this film, benefits us, the audience. The film is
absolutely gorgeous and should undoubtedly win Lubezki a third straight
Oscar for the cinematography, a first in the Academy's history. There
were multiple moments where I simply sat in awe at some of the
beautifully painted pieces of nature that both Lubezki and Iñárritu
give us. There were many times during this film that I felt like I was
watching a Malick film, which makes sense since Lubezki shot The New
World, which feels similar to The Revenant. There's been a lot of buzz around Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, how
it might finally earn him that alluding Oscar statue. Honestly, he
deserves it. The man ate raw meat and he's a damn vegetarian. Most of
his performance, which is brutally savage, has him fighting for his
life. He doesn't say much, it's hard to talk after having your throat
slashed by a bear. DiCaprio always delivers great performances in my
opinion, this one took him to his utter limits. It's hard to see
another performance this year that deserves it more. I pass equal
praise to Tom Hardy who stars as Fitzgerald, the "villain" of the
picture. Hardy always seems to disappear into his roles, this one is no
different. He's equal parts menacing and rough. DiCaprio is strong and
you need just as strong a performance to support him, Hardy does this
in spades. I'm sure there are people out there that will have the same reaction as
my wife. The film isn't perfect, it has some issues. There are numerous
sequences that showcase DiCaprio's dead wife, these elements stall the
already lengthy film. Had these sequences been cut out completely, or
even down to one scene, it would have helped significantly. The film
clocks in just under two and a half hours. That is a long film about a
fur trapper slowly making his way across some rough terrain. Add on top
of that the long take shots that Iñárritu loves to show off and you
have yourself a film that feels long. Iñárritu loves to showoff his
fancy camera work, he did this almost obnoxiously with Birdman a film I
did like. He does it again here, sometimes to great effect, sometimes
to annoyance. The camera gets so close to the actors at times that
their heavy breathing literally fogs up the lens of the camera. It
takes you out of the experience and reminds you, this is a film.......but what a film it is.

I was lucky enough to watch this movie early and saw it without the
knowledge that it was from the same director as Gravity and Birdman.The movie was good until the horse jumped off the cliff and into the
tree. Looking at the end result of that stunt the director completely
lost me as viewer. All the gravity the heavy story had; became an
absurdity, which is an incredible shame. That single scene should have
been edited out, which would have saved the story, because everything
what happened afterwards became an irritating show-off of special
effects (like The Hobbit trilogy) and no longer the gritty film what it
was.The special effects are indeed amazing and you are very often left
wondering how they have pulled that off; especially the bear scene.
However, special effects shouldn't dominate the movie and the story
should always come first!At the final scene it suddenly struck me that this was a movie from
Alejandro Gonzalez Innarito, because it was such a signature of his. It
is too bad he got too cocky here, because Gravity and Birdman were both
beautiful masterpieces. The Revenant in its current form is definitely
not a masterpiece unfortunately. Less would have most certainly been
more in this case and I can only hope they revise this movie before
release, trimming some unnecessary scenes out...

If like myself you have been desensitized over the years by watching
countless movies with blood, gore and violence and can now watch the
beach scene during Saving Private Ryan as though it was an episode of
Sesame Street, then prepare yourself to feel your pulse quicken once
more and that urge to raise your hand to cover your eyes from the
horror.......the horror. Those moments that are hard to watch but even
harder not to, are here, this time in the form of a very upset 300kg
grizzly bear and Leonardo DiCaprio's face. The realism of this scene is
incredible...I'm still trying to work out how they filmed it......maybe
it really happened and they've patched Leonardo back up somehow. The
Revenant, based on the TRUE yet unbelievable story of frontiersman Hugh
Glass,(1780  1833) is a survival revenge flick. The camera work is
some of the best I've seen om film, it flows effortlessly like a ghost
on the breeze, taking you up and close and sometimes closer than you
would like to be. These shots are often juxtaposed with some truly
beautiful and hypnotic images the wilderness. A great cast of actors
including Tom Hardy, who doesn't look like Tom Hardy again and has to
be one of the best British actors of recent times. I knew he was in
this movie and I still didn't recognize him at first. He plays the
hillbilly you'll love to hate and is excellent throughout this epic
odyssey. Leonardo DiCaprio does some of his best work in this movie and
also eats some truly disgusting food ( even Rambo wouldn't touch ) in
order to portray the realism of his character. As he crawls over 200
miles towards his salvation spurred on by his revenge, you will feel
every grunt and groan that his half dead corpse is capable of
producing. Surely he deserves an Oscar, if not only for best actor but
for best stomach. The Revenant is as uplifting as it is traumatic and
like his previous movie Birdman, director Alejandro González Iñárritu
has a gift for making it personal. A gift for transporting you from
your arm chair into another world, which in my opinion is what we want
a movie to do. Like Hugh Glass you will go through an ordeal in this
film, one that I highly recommend you survive for 159 minutes.

I have Watched many Hollywood films in my entire life,starting from
Casablanca to the thrilling Revenant.The Revenant has the best
cinematography the Hollywood has ever witnessed.The way Dicaprio lays
forward his character is obsoletely marvelous....Love u man.I don't how
a person can give performances like that.Forget the Oscars,you are the
best actor of all time after De Niro.Mark my words,this movie is very
thriller and not a waste of 2:46hrs. Movies like Shutter island,There
will be blood,saving private Ryan,Gladiator and many more are the
thrillers that I loved the most.But this movie..wow..way way
awesome.Tom hardy ..ohh..you need to express more man

So, where to start? The beauty of the shots: basically every scene was stunningly
beautiful. The nature had such a raw and rough and wild atmosphere. In
contrast to the wide shots of nature there where a lot of close-ups to
the characters. You felt like you were standing right in front of them.
In the action sequences you were so close to everything that happened:
you see the perspective of one character and only his. You don't get an
overview what's happening. You're close to some very graphic scenes
(contrast: beautiful shot composition - brutal scenes the shots show).
A lot of long takes (hello birdman) were used and it helps to stay in
one scene (I hate scenes with 15 cuts in 10 seconds). Inarritu also
lets the camera stay with the actors. You see their faces when they
learn new things, how they react to it.I loved the spare use of music. There was some much tension in a lot of
scenes, adding music would have ruined it. But when the (great) music
was used it underlined the moments perfectly.The actors were great, Hardy's performance especially. Also it seems
like you just have to add Gleeson to your movie and it will become
great.So all in all a great film. It sometimes feels long, but never boring.
I expect it to only grow with more viewings.

I am not a fan Iñárritu; but I concede I saw all his directed movies
since AMORES PERROS. I went to THE REVENAT with doubts; mostly because
having seen the original about 40 years ago, still remember it as
boring and depressing. However; when I saw this version trailer; the
images were so amazing that I felt the urge to see it. Well, I was not
disappointed at all. The story is pretty much the same but told in much more bearable way
(the original Richard Harris spent 90% of the movie alone). But are the
images and effects that stand out; created by using wide angle lenses
on close ups and moving the camera on 360 degrees; creating immersive
images that easily transmit to other senses. You feel the cold, the
water and the suffering. If Iñárritu tried to demostrate that nature is the greatest and most
spectacular (and dangerous) thing in this world; he succeed. The
digitally created THE FORCE AWAKENS should hide ashamed of what has
been achieved with a camera and some lenses. Just the Indians or the Bear attacks; completely compensates the price
of the ticket; but there is more from where that came from in this
incredible movie. The acting is superb. It required very humble and committed actors to
accept these roles. Tom Hardy is terrifying in a character that pure selfishness and not
allow a hint of sympathy. Di Caprio in his most physical interpretation
until today is outstanding. You are able to feel his pain and
suffering. In brief; if you want to see the most spectacular images or the most
terrifying fight man vs nature. Just go and see this movie.

Wasn't going to see this film, and wouldn't have except for that I was
in area when it was filmed (during the waterfall scene filming we were
on the river just a few hundred yards from where it was being filmed).
Very fortuitous happenstance, indeed.Parts of the movie are a little bloody, but not what I'd personally
consider to be gratuitous violence. What violence and gore is shown is
entirely necessary in building the story. Heads up, though, if that
kind of thing bothers you, you may find the film disturbing.Incredibly beautiful cinematography; no slow boring segments; the
characters are very engaging. I seldom give any movie more than 8 stars
maximum, but giving this one a very deserved 10 stars.

First off, the direction.. Just excellent. This movie is one of a kind. I have not seen anything like it before
and I actually doubt I will. The film was full of heart pounding,
exciting and unpredictable moments. It was full of gore in a way that
seemed quite realistic and it suited the overall plot and setting of
the movie. The acting.. I've seen better from Leo but he was really good. As for
Tom Hardy, he was simply excellent. The movie is about survival, love, struggle and revenge. Overall, I
liked it very much and I would watch it again. I'm torn between giving
it a 7 or an 8.

I'm not one to call a movie a "perfect 10" but "The Revenant" turned
out to be my favorite film of 2015, and my favorite film of at least
the last two (if not three) years.Dark, violent, unrelenting, and disturbing, "The Revenant" is also
staggeringly beautiful, hopeful, exhilarating, and deeply moving.And these seemingly conflicting emotional notes in fact go hand in
hand. Only recently released (it's wide debut was last weekend, as of
my writing this), the film is already underrated, and this is one of
those rare movies I really expect to grow in stature over the years,
not diminish.Despite mostly positive reviews, many critics are being way too hard on
this one--I suppose that's not too surprising. It seems like something
this great can't help but find critics looking for things to nitpick
(not to mention totally misread and misinterpret) about.I'm sure you already know the general plot line, so I won't even bother
recapping it. But there's so much more to The Revenant than meets the
eye (and there's nonstop stunning imagery to meet said eye!) Beyond
some of the most dazzling cinematography I've ever seen (Innaritu's
previous Oscar-winner, Birdman, turned out to be only a warm-up for
this one in that department), beyond a classic revenge story, and
beyond the uniformly fine performances (DiCaprio's best to date) is a
morally pertinent, narratively ambiguous, and spiritually uplifting
vibe unlike any other film I have seen.Don't like seeing movies on the big screen? Make an exception for this
one... Do yourself a favor and make an exception... The movie
completely immerses you in it's world (bereft of cartoonish CGI or
silly 3D glasses) and you are in the pioneering west for the cost of
your ticket... The camera swoops and swirls and puts you in the middle
of some truly spectacular action sequences. Every frame looks like a
postcard. The most ambitious nature documentaries don't capture the
beauty of nature as well as this film does (I suppose Emmanual Lubezki
should probably start working as DP for nature documentaries) with it's
use of real locations and natural lighting.The sticking point for critics seems to be that the film lacks
subtlety. While it's true that The Revenant is rather blunt and
uncompromising in its brutality, it's equally ambitious and ambiguous
in it's spirituality... And goes further than the typical survival
story in depicting man's perseverance in the face of adversity.Most survival stories depict people overcoming nature's cruelty... This
one depicts man's own moral failings as part of nature's cruelty. It's
not just a marauding bear or brutal weather Hugh Glass must overcome,
but his own moral failing in desiring revenge. Glass' primary motivator
for staying alive is also what could ultimately do him in. The same is
true of his adversary Fitzgerald.It all adds up to a film that is visually astonishing, emotionally
wrenching, and hits you on every level. A genuine must-see, and a truly
great film, deserving to go down as a classic. It reminded me of
Kubrick's best work, and that's no small compliment.A true epic.

I have read guys talking high of how incredible Hardy is in this film.
How many nuances in his acting, and bla bla bla bla bla. One guy dared
to say that Hardy was generally speaking a much better actor than Di
Caprio, and that this was the worst performance in Di Caprio's history.
That's delusional!!! They both are very good actors and I find it
pointless to make a diatribe about who is better. They have eventually
different acting styles: Di Caprio is more refined, Hardy is more
instinctive. But in THIS film, Di Caprio rules, without any possible
doubt. He goes deeper and is much more intense, while Hardy is a bit
over the top, playing the rude guy with western accent and rigid
movements. And I do not know what film hat watched that other reviewer,
but I do not see many nuances in Hardy's acting and face here. While Di
Caprio delivers a wide spectrum of many different emotions which can be
very easily read in every little movement of is face, while performing
the whole time at max power and top intensity.Now the film itself, it's an imposing film. I do not believe it is a
"masterpiece". But it is a good movie and kept me interested from
beginning to end. Anyway the synopsis is kind of misleading. It made me
believe that the WHOLE movie was about Di Caprio persecuting "those"
who left him for dead, but there is no "those" and you see it
immediately (so, no spoiler), there is just Hardy. And the real
persecution is a very short part of the movie, it is quite predictable,
and not so intense as I expected.EDIT: Di Caprio 1, Hardy 0. Sometimes the Oscars speak the truth. I
told you!

From this Mexican director comes another masterpiece after 'Birdman' !
I particularly got in love with magnificent cinematography of this
movie, which I haven't seen on any movie before. Unique long shot
without cutting, close to horizon angles, super wide shots are some of
the techniques that makes it different from other cinematic
experiences. It sort of takes you along in the movie. The sceneries
were chosen perfectly to imply the right feeling in the viewers for
each episode of the movie. And at last, Dicaprio's acting is one of his
best. At the end, it perfectly delivers the messages, whatever you do
to others, you get the same in return!

I was not expecting a lot due to amount of similar movies coming out
lately, but this movie, despite everything you might think of kind of
this genre and main theme, this is absolutely breathtaking in terms of
tension and feeling you experience watching it. Movie is holding your
attention from the begging till the very end with no exceptions.
Leonardo is great at his part, he keeps surprising with virility he has
developed over the year as an actor, he is perfect for main role in
this movie, cant imagine anyone else instead. No less important -
graphic of the movie is so realistic, you can't feel and see difference
between real live footage and graphic elements. Visually perfect in
matter of nature and action views.Great movie of 2015!

If you think gladiator was a epic film then this film will blow you
away! The true story of explorer hugo glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was
attacked by a bear and left for dead by his own team and if that was
not enough his confidant (Tom Hardy) betrayed him in a sinister twist.
The sheer grit and dertimination by hugo to return to his family barely
alive is a tribute to the actual events of this true story. This is one
of the most compelling storytelling ever done on the big screen its
brutal and some parts hard to watch like the bear attack but my god its
got to be one of the best films i have seen ever. You become so
involved in this film it truly grabs at your soul and you feel the
struggle hugo goes through, Tom Hardy is brilliant but Leonardo
DiCaprio is out of this world by just how amazing he portrays hugo, how
he to this date has not won a Oscar is a biggest mystery ever! He has
to win everything at the Oscars with the revenant. You may look away
when you see a run time of 156 minutes but trust me you will not be
sacrificing over 2 hours of your life. The story, plot screen shots
,camera angles everything about this film is brilliant there are not
enough words to explain how great it really is. #leoforoscars

This is a masterpiece. After watching Mad Max: Fury Road, I thought no
other film would be able to top it this year, but The Revenant is right
up there with it. Let me start by saying that I have not been a fan of Iñárritu in
particular. His films are generally not my cup of tea even though his
talent is undeniable. This time around, however, he truly outdid
himself and actually showed that he can soar at the same heights as
Kurosawa himself. The Revenant is a revolutionary piece of film-making in how they
managed to use natural light, breath-taking camera angles, incredible
action sequences, long shots, stunning locations and previously unseen
special effects. The pace, length and rhythm of the movie are exactly what they need to
be for an epic tale of this magnitude. The performances by the entire
cast are memorable, and Lubezki's camera-work is peerless. In short, I find it hard to recall a movie as engaging, realistic and
groundbreaking as The Revenant. Beyond its technical mastery, the cast,
crew and writers managed to deliver a powerful message about the power
of nature, human will and love.

Symptomatic of a lot of American movies of late, The Revenant's
greatest disappointment is the inability to have speaking parts clearly
audible. Indeed, some of the accents employed are so thick I think they
spent a lot of time with their mouths full of cotton wool. The
character, Fitzgerald, was so bad I didn't understand a word he said.I may buy this movie off the reject pile at the DVD store but don't
expect me to see it again on the big screen.Visually the scenery is fantastic and highlights the somber mood of the
story, a few bright days serve even more to emphasize the darkness.In fact I was so disappointed I walked out. DiCaprio may be worthy of
an Oscar, this movie as whole should not be nominated.

Glass (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a scout working for a company that
collects and sells fur pelts. His task is to protect his group and
guide them safe. Things go bad once they are attacked by Indians that
want to steal their pelts. 33 out of 45 die and the rest, along with
Glass and his Indian son Hawk are left trying to get back to the fort
safely. Fitzerald (Tom Hardy) is not keen of Glass as we understand
from the very first moments, and he is actually the villain in this
story. Not long after the attack Glass left the group to scout the
territory and is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear. He's found
almost dead and after given some basic medical care he is carried by
his peers, on their way to the fort. The Indians that attacked them are
still searching for them, and they are on foot, and after seeing it is
almost impossible to keep going with having to carry Glass all the way,
they assign a smaller group of 3 persons to assist him. His son Hawk, a
young kid and also Fitzerald that actually volunteered (for a fee) to
safely bring Glass home. Of course bringing him back was never his real
intention so at the first opportunity he tried to take the life of
Glass through suffocation and kills his son Hawk for trying to stop
him. Then lied to the other kid that was accompanying them that Indians
were coming and left on a hurry leaving Glass to die. But Glass is not
dead yet and this is where the movie actually starts, with Glass trying
to save himself, return to the fort and of course get revenge from
Fitzerald. The photography of the film is amazing, the direction of course too.
The acting is perfect from both our leads (Di Caprio and Hardy) and we
already know that Di Caprio is a candidate for the Oscar. As much as
I'd like him to get it (cause he deserved one so far) and as much as I
liked his performance, I'm not convinced for an Oscar. Definitely a
candidate though. Hardy on the other hand could easily get one for a
supporting role too. My score is 7/10 for the movie cause, as much I liked it, I found it
too long and had many inconsistencies in the script that I could not
overlook. First of all this guy should be dead. But even if he isn't, he should
be crippled. We see him crawling for most of the second act, after he
was left for dead. My thought was that how is he going to pull this off
while crawling the rest of the movie? Well, to my surprise, he started
to stand and then walk just a few scenes later! Although we do not have
a time reference, it is obvious we are only a few days apart from the
day he could not walk or catch a breath or move his hands. It would
make much more sense if he would be able to stand and later walk AFTER
he crawled all his way to the Indian friend he made, that fed him,
carried him on a horse and fixed his wounds with affection. I also do not understand why he was eating raw meat (and vomiting with
disgust) when fires were lit all around him. It would take a moment
only to get some cooked meat. Also, why would they act like crazy when
they found water, when they had fire anytime they wanted and unlimited
snow all around? Why wouldn't they store some meat from the huge animal
they were eating (it is freezing cold so it would stay in edible
condition for months) and had to eat roots only one scene later? Those
things and a few more led to a 7/10 score. But if you can overlook
those and let Mr Inaritu carry you away with his vivid direction then
you are definitely going to receive at a great cinematic experience.

Disregarding what happened during filming, the final product is superb.
We've seen this story so many times in different forms, but never with
such photographic beauty, masterful direction and editing and
extraordinary performance of two main characters. It seem that DiCaprio
excels in anything he does, and after a disaster stupidity of "Mad Max"
Tom Hardy got a chance to show what he really can do. Add to this
hypnotizing music of Ryuichi Sakamoto and you have a perfect movie.I
suppose DiCaprio will again lose the Oscar, taken into account his
opinion on the "members of the Academy" (yes, bunch of moldy mummies
that lost the touch with common sense, taste and reality long time
ago), and he deserves one for every role he's taken by now. One of the
best actors ever.Extremely recommended, even if you (like me) did not like The Birdman
by the same director. This one is truly a masterpiece of 7th art.

In the 1820s, a frontiersman named Hugh Glass sets out on a path of
vengeance against those who left him for dead after a bear mauling.After last years Birdman, Alejandro G. Inarritu's The Revenant quickly
became one of my most anticipated films of the year. Birdman was my
favorite film last year due to Inarritu's supreme talent behind the
camera, he truly is a filmmaker like no other.Inarritu's partnership with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki lent
itself for visual poetry in Birdman and the much discussed illusion of
a phenomenal one take for the entire film. This time they have made a
film supposedly all shot on natural light, a task so daring that The
Revenant's shoot was said to be one of the hardest in history. The beauty this natural light has achieved is fantastic and it is one
if not the best looking film this year. It gives the viewer the
sensation of being in this world with the characters for perhaps the
most immerse experience I have had this year. The palette is bleak,
Inarritu and Lubezki work wonders with the Snow covered hills and
valleys of the American wilderness. Inarritu's camera-work is
unparalleled and his use of close ups, tracking shots and long takes
are genius.Leonardo DiCaprio gives what I would say is the best performance of the
year. It's utterly heart wrenching to watch the struggle his character
"Hugh Glass" must endure. The way in which DiCaprio enables his
physical and facial expressions to comprehend his character is
astounding. His pain and quest for revenge fuels the narrative and
DiCaprio truly embodies this man with subtle, catastrophic tendencies.
For much of the film we follow his horrendous journey to survive and
how DiCaprio keeps us Enthralled is a testament to his acting
abilities.Tom Hardy gives an outstanding performance as the heinous "John
Fitzgerald" a man with who we feel through circumstance has become a
monster. His horrible selfish, morally appalling actions act as an
fascinating counter balance to "Hugh Glass". Hardy portrays the
antagonist with the hypnotic presence and execution of dialog we can
only have come to expect from him as an actor. Domhnall Gleeson plays
the interesting character of "Andrew Henry" captain of the expedition
and a man of honor and dignity who must act as the stabilizer among his
brutal men.The Revenant's narrative maintains its intensity throughout. It's that
rare film that never gives you a second to breath and it seems greater
danger looms around every frame of "Hugh's" journey for survival. One
particular scene pits "Hugh Glass" against a grizzly bear, and it is
one of the most heart pounding sequences I have seen this year. The
visceral imagery, magical realism and nightmarish elements weave there
way excellently into the story, in many cases it is a poetic voyage
were every shot has deeper meaning.Overall, The Revenant is an incredible journey into the capacity of the
human spirit and what it can endure. Inarritu and his cinematographer
Lubezki have crafted a film unlike anything I have ever seen and with a
performance as deeply constructed as DiCaprio it's definitely an
experience I will not forget. I am going to give it a 10/10.

The Revenant is an almost seemingly impossible movie to make. Long
stretches of quiet, lonely time in a world that seems so distant from
the one that we live in now. But behind the task of bringing the
wilderness to life and giving it the screen time it deserves, is a
story almost too good to be true. If there is one duo capable of taking
on this task it is the director and cinematographer, Alejandro G.
Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki. They brought this movie to life in ways
I wound never have imagined. You really feel like Hugh Glass is right
there next to you. When he gets injured you feel it, when he succeeds
its like you do too. On top of an already beautiful looking movie from
top to bottom,the cast is also at top notch. Leo turns in a terrific
performance as Hugh Glass, aside from it being a bit overplayed in
certain spots and the fact that it is difficult to not see him as the
most famous actor on the planet, it is one of his most memorable
performances. Will Poulter, and Domhnall Gleeson also turn in strong
supporting performances but the real display here is from Tom Hardy.
While he has always been good at playing the villain, never has he been
so right for a role as this one. You will truly grow to despise his
character and love every second of it. While their is not much writing
to speak of, the two and a half hour run time seems to fly by. Iñárritu
is cementing his name as one of the top directors going right now, and
this movie really shows off how far he is willing to go. There are so
many little touches that make this move feel as real as possible, from
only using natural light to the long cold shoots, Iñárritu pushed these
actors to the brink, and I think the movie is better for it. Back to
the look of the film, it really is one of the best looking films of all
time. Everything is captured with great expanse and fluidity. Some long
shot scenes without cuts are mesmerizing and jaw dropping. These two
got it right last year with Birdman, and they have taken the talent and
moved it outside of the theater. It may be difficult to watch other
movies for a while after viewing the Revenant. Nothing will come close
to the expansiveness of Iñárritu's wilderness. The realism alone will
make most other movies look silly. One of the few problems I thought
plagued The Martian was that I never really felt alone up on Mars.
Contact always seemed far too accessible. In the Revenant There is a
real feeling of desperation and loneliness that is incredibly hard to
accomplish. This movie is a real cinema masterpiece, and while not a
perfect 10/10 it is still a must see movie this year.

Firstly off, would just like to say that this movie probably isn't for
everyone as it is very long and slow in some periods....but seriously,
what a spectacle it is. Filmed with all natural lighting and out in the
actual snow/forest etc, combined with the lovely, slow and drawn out
cinematography, you will be hard pressed finding a better looking movie
than this one this year. It is as beautiful as it is brutal. As always,
Leonardo DiCaprio gives us a stellar performance as Hugh Glass fighting
for his life and vengeance, but just as good were the other key
performances in Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter. Lastly,
its not often you can say "this movie made me feel cold", but The
Revenant will absolutely have that effect on some people. A must see.

world. So, it only makes sense that everyone's definition of a good
film would vary, and that everyone would watch a film for different
reasons. Most people watch movies for fun. To kill a Friday, to be
entertained, to laugh a little. Fewer watch films to experience the
craft of it all. To follow the Oscars, to admire cinematography and
direction, and to take in all the things that make films great. Until I
saw "The Revenant," I believed that those were the only two reasons
worth discussing, as they were the two most prevalent in our society.
But this film is not just for entertainment, nor is it something to
watch just to feel smart. The Revenant is viscerally powerful and
terrifyingly real, and something entirely new that I've rightfully
heard called "visual poetry."Maybe it's the breathtaking, masterful cinematography - ambitiously and
successfully crafted using only natural light - that categorizes this
film as such. Perhaps it's the direction, which causes everything about
the film to appear so seamlessly realistic that the audience is forced
into the world as if we are experiencing its horrors right along with
the characters (most unique and effective is Iñárritu's purposeful
emphasis on the camera: at three points, Hugh Glass fogs the
claustrophobic lens with his breath, and during the perfectly
envisioned ending, Glass stares right into the camera, all the pain and
suffering he has felt represented in his eyes as they stare, haunted
but finally peaceful, straight at the audience). And maybe its the
performances, so unbelievably nuanced and emotionally devastating by
DiCaprio (gunning for an extremely deserved first Oscar in perhaps a
career-best performance), Hardy (in the conversation for a very worthy
first nomination in a wonderfully villainous but 3-dimensional role)
and Gleeson (proving once again to the world that he's the next
DiCarpio by appearing in four Oscar-worthy films in one year). Whatever
heavenly combination of sheer craft, storytelling capabilities, and
divine intervention brought this revolutionary film to the screen, I am
eternally grateful. It is not simple entertainment, although its
narrative is riveting. It is not your usual Oscar bait, although any
and all Oscar wins would be monumentally deserving. The Revenant is
what happens when every aspect of film is brought together perfectly
and seamlessly constructed to create one horrifyingly real but
astronomically memorable experience.

The Revenant may be marketed as a revenge-thriller, but it's really
about Hugh Glass (Leo) vs nature. Nearly the entire movie is about
Glass battling Mother Earth and struggling to survive the night. And I
gotta say it was both breathtaking and stressful. Day after day seeing
him struggle with simple tasks and knowing the insane journey he has in
front of him is taxing. The amount of punishment the man goes through
is enough to make Bear Grylls compassionate.Some people might try to water this one down and say it is nothing more
than a revenge flick. That may be true to some extent, but it is more
to the movie than just that. It's a man vs nature and his struggle to
survive for one last cause (that cause obviously being revenge). There
is also a message about white men vs Indians that can't be ignored.
It's something we have seen before, yes, but it doesn't make it any
less sorrowful or profound.The middle of the film does get a tad repetitive as we watch Leo
struggle for shelter and fight the cold again and again. This would be
a major drawback if the movie didn't look this beautiful (fingers
crossed for a Best Cinematography Oscar). The location mixed with the
camera work seems to make the cold jump off screen. The movie might not
have hundreds of characters, large-scale battles, or fantasy-like
elements, but this truly is an epic.I can see how a lot of people might be turned off by the movie (a huge
chunk of the movie his Glass literally wandering the wilderness day and
night), I still stand by my statement that it's one of the year's best
and deserves to be seen on the big screen!

I had been excited for this film since the first trailer came out, and
let me say that it did not disappoint. I was a little worried from a
few slightly negative reviews on YouTube. Many of these reviews
complained that the film was slow. They're not wrong, but I thought it
was slow in a good way. Anyway let me break it down.The story was very well done. It starts off running with quite a lot of
action and conflict at hand. The movie somehow makes you feel like
you're with this group in the middle of the wilderness in the early
1800s.Then there's the bear attack. It was one of the most intense, jarring,
even disturbing scenes I've scene in cinema. I have no idea how the
hell they did it, but it was excellently executed.Moving into the second act, the film does slow down a bit. This is a
complaint most people have, however I feel otherwise. Many westerns
such as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly have a similar slow pace. It's
ultimately a good thing though as it draws out the tension more and
raises the personal stakes for the protagonist.Some people also complain about the spiritual visions that Glass has. I
didn't mind them at all. It was a good way to forge a greater
connection with the protagonist as we see the emotional trauma he's
enduring. There are still some visions I didn't quite understand, so I
plan on re-watching to analyze these.Having been shot in natural light, it is perhaps one of the most
beautiful looking films I've ever seen. Coupling this with really clean
and heavy sound design and some pretty brutal parts made the movie feel
real.The movie paints a very realistic portrait of the raw violence
that occurred in this time period. By the end of it, you'll be thankful
you never lived in the 1820s.Keep in mind, if you're looking for an action-packed, fast paced
adventure movie, you may be disappointed. This is more of a personal
survival/revenge story.And yes, Leo should win an Oscar for this one. There were a few times
when his screams were so jarring and meaningful that I almost teared
up.Watch this movie.

First of all, Dicaprio gives performance of a lifetime,i am a huge fan
of him anyways but this performance tops any of his past performances.the music is so good that its unreal, keeps you in the movie at all
times. even though its a long ride but every second is worth your
attention.this is my first review for any movie but it would have been selfish
and dishonest to not appreciate a movie like this.Hands down for the director and the rest of the case as well. VISUALLY AMAZING, TOP DIALOGUE, EXTRA ORDINARY MUSIC, AND DECAPRIO my
friend, you are the BEST!

Alejandro González Iñárritu's masterpiece. a tour de force, if I've
ever seen one. from the amazing opening shot, this movie immediately
hooks you. the movie is a brutal depiction of man against the wild. a
survivalist story that can sometimes be difficult to watch or even
stomach, as some of the scenes can be quite gruesome. the performances
of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy are spectacular. Leonardo, who
doesn't speak much threw out the movie, depicts Hugh Glass's pain and
suffering with the skill of a true thespian grand master. Tom Hardy is
chameleon. he is able to lose himself in a character in such a way that
unless you know it's him acting the part, most people would never know
it was him. all in all this was a great story. just prepare to lose
yourself for about two and half hours. I assure you, it will be well
worth the time.

The trailer for Revenant is very misleading. It would have you believe
this film is full of fighting scenes, battles and generally action.
It's not. It's mostly about one man's struggle against nature.
Overcoming his weakness and injuries in his drive for revenge and
survival. The majority of the film is slow-paced and focused on the
incredible willpower of the protagonist. Seeing this film on the big screen can be overwhelming. The brutal,
realistic scenes, close-up shots of actors' faces, perfectly showing
the struggle and pain they experience, and the incredibly harsh
environment, make for one of the most memorable cinematic experiences
this year. As can be expected from DiCaprio and Hardy, the acting is
phenomenal. One can almost feel the pain, the cold, the hunger and the
fear they experience. The camera captures all this perfectly, as well
as showing beautiful scenery and biting winter weather, all filmed
using only natural light. The plot, despite being quite simple, keeps the viewers on the edge of
their seats, rooting for the hero's survival and admiring every time he
manages to get up and keep going. The one criticism would be about the realism of all the misfortune,
that befalls DiCaprio's character. There are points where it is really
too much for one man to endure and the opinion of the antagonist, that
"there is no way he could survive that" seems quite correct. Another thing to note: this is not a film for the squeamish. The
graphic, bloody scenes involving both humans and animals do not hold
back in realism.

Leonardo DiCaprio deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. His
part in this movie was very, very well played out, he made you feel
that he was actually suffering from the pain that he received.Watching Leonardo go through things he did made you feel lucky that we
don't need to live the way they did back then and fear that any moment,
your life could end. Tom Hardy's role was also played well, watching
his role, he made you feel that you need to jump through the screen to
help Leonardo to seek his revenge.I will not say much, but I could watch this movie again. I know that
this movie will be one of the best movies that will be out in 2016.This is a very must watch film. I will also give much of the credit to
the Director for making this feel real.

Excellent movie, excellent acting. Leo is superb. The scenes were so
realistic and the topic was simple but effective. Normally I am not a
big fan of Alejandro González Iñárritu movies although I believe that
they are good but not my type of movies. However, he nailed this one
and created a masterpiece. Overall, the movie is dark and deep. The
scenery, script and the whole flow was flawless. Plus excellent
cinematography. I have never watched a survivor movie like this with
great amount of tension before. Seriously, 150 min went in the blink of
an eye. GLeo was great too. No doubt he is an A listed true actor. Now in my top 10. Great movie.

I must say it's refreshing to watch Alejandro González Iñarritu's style
in an otherwise uncomplicated plot. The Revenant's story is simple, yet
scenery, acting and overall pace of the movie is amazing. You feel lost
and panicked when the group is under attack, distressed when attacked
by the bear (AMAZING scene by the way) and hopeless but you can relate
with Glass' motivation for vengeance. This movie immerses you in the
story and keeps your attention. It's a great tale of survival and
instinct, it achieves a very high level of realism with each take. It
features long take scenes which are being mastered by Mexico's golden
directors like Iñarritu and Cuarón, which always seem so fluent but
must be so incredibly difficult to achieve. Kudos!

Leo Di Caprio stars as Hugh Glass, a man who survives a grizzly attack,
falling down a waterfall, an attack by the Indians and falling down a
cliff (while on his horse) just in order to get back at Fitzgerald(Tom
Hardy). This being a Hollywood film, it's not very hard to guess who
will have the last laugh, in spite of all the obstacles that one could
only survive in CGI. And don't even get me started on Glass' ability to
miraculously recover from each near- fatal injury in no time and just
keep crawling and panting through snow and ice. Even if one looks past
all that (if you want real life, you don't go to a cinema in the first
place anyway), the other flaw of the film is that you don't really feel
anything for the characters. With everything favoring your sympathies
for Glass, he doesn't pull it off, since he hardly say anything for the
whole duration of the movie, and his relationship to his son doesn't
come off as emotional/warm enough in order to justify going through so
much effort to revenge his death. That being said, there's one thing
though that I enjoyed immensely- the breathtaking photography that
makes you easily fall in love with Canadian forests and mountains. If
you ignore the ridiculous plot, this comes off as a true love letter to
the marvels of nature and its cruel beauty.

It's takes you on that type of exhausting ride that you get watching
Black Swan.The movie is about one man's struggle to survive the wilderness after
being fatally wounded. The film reminds me of The Martian. Though both movies seem very
different, they are both about men surviving in ruff Terran in the
worse circumstances, and they both rely heavily on their lead actors. I
realize through this movie, I'm a bigger fan of watching Matt Damon for
hours, but Leonardo DiCaprio does give an amazing performance. Leo made
me feel for this man, who could have given up at anytime and we all
would have understood, but he keeps going driven by the love of his son
and pure vengeance. The Revenant makes you feel the cold winter. Every bruise and cut on
Leo's body, given to him by a fight he has with a bear, one of the best
fights in cinema history I might add. Some of the things that he did to
survive will make you cringe, but Leo gets down and dirty in order to
make us believe, and I did. The Wilderness is no joke and The Revenant is no holds bar in showing
it to you.Tom Hardy gives a great performance in the film as the antagonist more
concern about his money than the welfare of others. Also enjoined
Domhnall Gleeson as the honorable captain of the crew Leo and Tom were
a part of. It's mostly Leo in this picture, but he did have a good
supporting crew. The cinematography was great, the visual effects were perfect, the
Camera puts you right there in the action, and the action was as savage
as the wilderness it takes place in. I am impressed highly with this.
Be ready to get caught up in the Revenant, cause it won't let you go,
till the end.

I am a die-hard fan of Leonardo Dicaprio and was waiting long for this
movie. The trailer had created strong hype for the movie. The movie is
directed by 'Birdman' director Alejandro Inarritu who is known for
magnificent direction. Leonardo was masterpiece as always and has not
let down in this too. The story centers on Hugh Glass, a frontiersman
who was left alone after bear attack and killed his son. Leo takes
revenge to new style with its own survival style. This can be expected
from Leo to be perfect in every condition and can do anything to draw
into character. Leo's performance was outstanding and this time I hope
Oscar gets to Leo. I go with 8/10 for this movie with Leo's
extraordinary performance.

The Revenant is definitely one of the best shot films of the year. Some
of the camera moves are just extraordinary. The story is simple, but
that's fine because it's the overall experience that's unique, not the
premise. It's basically a revenge western meets a survival story. Set
in frosty Montana, Hugh Glass must overcome all odds to avenge the
death of his son. All the acting is great- but it's the mood that
really stands out. From icy mountains, to great plains, the oppressive
and gloomy atmosphere will not be for everyone. It's a hard film to sit
through. There are scenes of great violence and very very slow-paced
scenes. Plus the runtime is over two and half hours. So it might not be
for everyone- but it's still an excellent film.

Short and simple-Brilliant!!! Iñárritu's cinematic vision is brilliant
to every aspect of this movie. Each scene feels ridiculously real.The
cinematography is par excellent and with all the articles about the
movie being shoot in extreme conditions,Emmanuel Lubezki has pulled of
a masterpiece. DiCaprio has enliven the role of Hugh glass with complete justice. Tom
Hardy as a supporting cast is perfect.Will Poulter and Domhnall Gleeson
were also influential in their roles. The background score has the same feel as Birdman and adds to the
violence, chaos, and pain in the movie. A must watch. You will come out tantalized.

The Revenant is one of the best movies as far as cinematography
goes.The natural shots they were able to take are amazing and
mesmerizing.The visuals are beyond perfect and that "Bear scene" is so
great that it's hard to believe how they were able to do it.The movie
is gritty and also intense while still being very interesting and
gorgeously shot with top notch performances and directing. Leonardo
DiCaprio gives one of the best,if not the best performance of the year
by a male in a leading role and I truly hope that this time he actually
gets to win an Oscar for this.He's so committed to the role and it
shows especially in some of the more brutal scenes. Tom Hardy also
nails the role perfectly and gives almost an equally great performance
as Leo.His voice is weird though but by now we're used to him having
different voices on different roles,even though sometimes is hard to
understand what he's saying. It does get brutal though and some of the
things that the characters have to do to survive are beyond disgusting
but reasonable and understandable for the situations they're in. The
soundtrack is also very good but it's not what you take away from the
movie the most,because the amazing cinematography and the style of the
movie,the direction that Alejandro G.Iñárritu goes including here the
two amazing performances of the leads are what you take away the most
about this amazing cinematic achievement. At 153 minutes it is a bit
too long but that doesn't take away from the movie that much because
this still remains as one of the best movies of the year with some of
the best performances,cinematography,visuals a really good score and
memorable scenes that are bound to stick in your mind for a long time
after.

The whole movie revolves around a mishap and the betrayal of a few!Brilliant cinematography, acting and filming. This movie is so well
made that it will give you chills while watching. Not even once I felt
bored or lack of interest. Kudos to the scriptwriters and directors!Mark L. Smith (screenplay) Alejandro González Iñárritu
(screenplay/director) Michael Punke (Novelist)If Leonardo does not get an Oscar for his spine chilling role for 'The
Revenant' then Oscar Awards ceremony should be closed!I would say a must watch!!

The Revenant is almost a masterpiece and definitely in the list of 2015
best movies Leonardo DiCaprio gives an amazing performance as a man who
has nothing left to loose he gets attacked by a bear, he falls from a
cliff, he falls into cold water and he even gets stabbed and he still
comes to take the head of Tom Hardy. If i have to pick 2 of my favorite
scenes from this film is definitely that bear scene which it looked so
real every time that he gets attacked and that scene with the horse
which i don't want to ruin i can't remember any other Dicaprio movie
that he gave his best or even with so much gore. If Leonardo DiCaprio
doesn't get this Oscar for this movie then he will never get one. The
rest of the cast wasn't really that great in my opinion especially Tom
Hardy who just plays Bane without a mask. At the end The Revenant was a
great survival film with a smart script, great direction, locations and
a powerful performance by Leo.

The terms "immersive" and "visceral" are often loosely used, but THE
REVENANT has taken strong ownership of them, and all it takes is
director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's sharp and creative directing and
maestro cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's distinctive camera style and
seamless edits that take us through the landscape, up close and
personal. THE REVENANT is one of those films that will be talked about
for generations to come, whether it be at a film school among students
and experts or at a coffee shop among aficionados who've just seen one
of the most incredible films ever.The character Hugh Glass is a legend when it comes to the history of
the frontier, these are the times before the things we often associate
with wild wild west. Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and
co-scribe Mark L. Smith take source from Michael Punke's novel but they
put a fictional twist of their own on this actual historical character,
played in the film by the great Leonardo DiCaprio. In this film, Hugh
Glass has a mixed race son because he was once had native-American
wife, Glass and his son join fur-trapping business that got attacked by
the natives, one of the people in their expedition is John Fitzgerald,
played by Tom Hardy. One day, Glass gets mauled by a bear and left for
dead by his team members. Fitzgerald is one of the three staying behind
to care for Glass and to give him a proper burial should he passes. But
Fitzgerald kills Glass' son and takes off instead, an event which then
motivates Glass to survive in his relentless pursuit of revenge.Whether it be interior like "Birdman" or outdoors like "The Revenant,"
Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a director who's committed to taking the
audience to fully experience because he understands the wide range and
the scale and he also fully understands the stories of these characters
and he smartly conveys them to you. Yes, it's a primal existential
survival story, yes it's also a revenge and redemption story, yes it's
also father and son story, but the way Alejandro films it, the way he
tells it, makes THE REVENANT more nuanced than that. And just like how
this film manages to transport you to a land and time that's rarely
tackled in cinema, it also successfully transports visual spectacle to
a new height that's never before seen nor felt. The sequence in which
Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass gets mauled by a bear, for example, it's
as if you could feel Glass and the bear's breath. This is also why
Lubezki is one of the greatest of all-time because his cinematography
aims to make you feel like you're present there, you see the angles,
the edges of the screen, everything about it is very welcoming, very
inclusive.This is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance yet, one of the things
that makes him a great actor is that he's clever in his rhythmical
movement and facial expressions, he's on point, he knows how to make a
scene more emotional or more intense, this is an actor who gives his
all for his characters, and you see that dedication once again in THE
REVENANT, working in toughest most uncomfortable conditions, he even
strips down naked, Leo's devotion to this character, Hugh Glass, is
admirable. Tom Hardy also gives an equally outstanding performance as
the villain, Fitzgerald, who's only looking out for number one, what
matters to Fitzgerald are himself and his ambitions, he doesn't have a
problem with kicking integrity or honor to the curb if need be. And so
when Hugh Glass ultimately gets in the way, it's kill or be killed mode
for Fitzgerald and Hardy, with his sturdy intimidating stature,
accomplishes that.THE REVENANT is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of
the works of writer/director Terrence Malick, whom Emmanuel Lubezki
collaborated with several times including "The New World." There's
something majestic, something grand about THE REVENANT and at the same
time, there's also something inspiring and hopeful about it. THE
REVENANT is a work of art, a masterpiece.

So yes the cinematography is excellent. Lubezki (the main camera man)
has drawn on all his experience from his work with director Terence
Malik - not a static shot to be noticed. However, and it is a big HOWEVER, the actual screenplay itself I feel
is where the movie is let down big time. I just frankly feel that the
story asks too much of the viewer. As per Blake Snyders "double mumbo
jumbo" rule (viewers can only accept one piece of magic per film)
Iñárritu expects us to believe three:1. Glass survives a bear mauling (fair enough)2. Glass survives a bear mauling AND a post-icy river swim in sub zero
temperatures with no pneumonia3. Glass survives a bear mauling AND a post-icy river swim in sub zero
temperatures with no pneumonia AND a serious jump off a cliff on horse
backI'm sorry but I find this absolute nonsense. Why go to such great
lengths in a film to try to show grit and realism with your
cinematography and characters etc, only to spoil it by adding in some
balls that the Hollywood exec thought "I think they'll buy it..." ?Poor show me thinks.

Overall, this is a solid film with great cinematography and a full
appreciation of a way to draw viewers into the rawness of the frontier
during the time period which the film set. DiCaprio gives a very
invested performance. Without giving too much away, the infusion of
reality that is necessary to come through and actors nonverbal
performance is very present. The entire venue becomes somehow colder,
more isolated, more barren... This is very much one to watch in
theaters or high-quality home venues. The efforts are applauded and a
quality story is told.How it fares on the road to the Oscars may be a different story but
DiCaprio certainly has given Depp and all competitors a run for their
money. Hats off to Leonardo based on the premise that he has definitely
developed and progressed tremendously as a thespian.Highly recommended, not for the faint of heart. Solid film, a nice
return the storytelling and cinema.
