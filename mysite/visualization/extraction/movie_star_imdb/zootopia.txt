You owe it to yourself to see Disney's new animated film Zootopia, a
film so timely and relevant it's almost startling. You owe it to
yourself to seek it out in a time in America where craziness,
hatefulness, and fear is being further instilled in the general public
by the very same people who should be fighting against it; the very
same people who should be forcing us, as a collective, to rise above
simple-minded assertions and mass generalizations about the people
around us. You owe it to yourself to see this film simply because it's
a brand new Disney classic.The film takes place in the vibrant, diverse world of Zootopia, a place
where predators and prey live together in harmony, and are free to be
whoever and whatever they want to be. These reasons are precisely why
the land attracts Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a small
bunny with dreams of being a police officer. Living on a farm, her
parents fear this because, not only has a bunny never become a police
officer, but they feel Judy should confine her aspirations to selling
carrots on the family farm, something Judy has no interest in doing.
After successfully completing police training, Judy is thrust into the
force alongside other, more muscled animals such as rhinoceroses, rams,
bulls, and elephants. Oh my.Judy's boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo, forces her to be a
"metermaid" while the other animals take on the bigger crimes,
specifically a case involving fourteen missing predators. Judy tries to
show herself by issuing over two-hundred citations in just a couple of
hours, but to no avail, as Chief Bogo wants to make sure she knows her
place on the Zootopia police force. When Judy winds up catching a
weasel after robbing a store, she is just about to be fired when Chief
Bogo tasks her with finding a local otter who has been missing for over
a week. If she can find the otter in forty-eight hours or less, she can
keep her job, but if she doesn't, she'll be forced to resign. Judy
enlists in the help of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a fox, one of the
most looked-down-upon predators in Zootopia, who has been doing number
of odd jobs since he was young, after blackmailing him in order to get
him to cooperate. Together, the two work to find the otter, but in
turn, discover something bigger. Oh my.Zootopia wears its intentions on its sleeves, but not in a way that
distracts or simplifies its core themes. As you can probably tell, this
is a film about both racism and sexism, two features of society that,
while probably never going away so long as humans roam the Earth, do
not have to be such amplified forces of hate. Screenwriters Jared Bush
and Paul Johnston carefully construct a world, predicated upon a
particular dream, and within that world, populate it with a variety of
characters, some labeled as normative, others quietly labeled as the
enemy that many are waiting to step out of line. It doesn't take a
scholar to see that rabbits represent women in society, while predators
represent minorities.It does, however, take considerable screen writing talent to create a
film that can be enjoyed and understood by both children and adults on
a fairly similar level. Even Pixar's Inside Out was a film that sort of
teetered a bit more to the adult crowd, with its lofty morals about
children coping with their emotions, despite the fact that kids of all
ages could at least enjoy the film as surface-level entertainment. Bush
and Johnston pen Zootopia carefully, but bluntly, to the point where
you can't ignore its profound, but simple message of inclusion and
acceptance of peers. Oh my.Countless animated films have made themselves about preaching the
gospel of acceptance and loving thy neighbor, but few have done it with
the kind of thematic relevance, consistent wit, and zealous energy as
Zootopia. Rather than sticking too a cleverly storyboarded, intricate
plot, Bush and Johnston also have no problem playing around, allowing
both Judy and Nick to free-roam in a sandbox full of original
characters and allowing conversational/situational humor to prevail.
This is why we get uproariously funny sequences involving three-toed
sloths at the DMV, in addition to immensely creative,
blink-and-you-miss-it chase sequences between a rabbit and a weasel.
The film is not short on ideas nor energy, and the remarkable thing is
how the film can go almost one-hundred miles an hour in every
department and not even come close to running out of gas by the end
credits.Zootopia is a contemporary Disney classic and should be treated as
such; it will certainly give Pixar's questionable Finding Dory a run
for its money in quality, awards, and overall relevance when it comes
out this summer. This is a film that finds a way to be both sweet and
simple, yet so urgent and topical, with an A-list voice cast, that you
feel it's a soft rallying cry for unity, which is all the more reason
why you shouldn't ignore it.Voiced by: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons,
Tommy Chong, and Octavia Spencer. Directed by: Byron Howard and Rich
Moore.

In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit
from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her dream of becoming the first rabbit
officer in the police department of nearby city Zootopia. However, upon
arrival, she is assigned parking duty by Chief Bogo, an African
buffalo, who doubts her potential due to her being a rabbit and thus
smaller than most of the large animals on the force. During one of her
shifts, she meets Nick Wilde, a con artist fox.Hopps abandons her shift to arrest a thief, Duke Weaselton. She is
reprimanded by Bogo and nearly fired until Mrs. Otterton, an otter,
arrives pleading for help locating her missing husband Â– one of many
animals recently missing in Zootopia. To Bogo's dismay, Hopps
volunteers and agrees to resign if she cannot solve the case within 48
hours. She sees Wilde in the last known photo of Otterton and tracks
him down, coercing him into to assisting her with the investigation.After acquiring Mr. Otterton's license plate number, Hopps and Wilde
track the vehicle to Mr. Big, an Arctic shrew crime boss. Mr. Big
informs the pair that Otterton, his florist, had gone savage and
attacked his chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar. Hopps and Wilde locate
Manchas, who mentions "night howlers" were responsible for attacking
him before he goes savage and chases the pair out of his home. When
Bogo and his reinforcements arrive, Manchas disappears. Bogo demands
Hopps resign, but Wilde takes a stand, insisting they have 10 more
hours to solve the case. As the pair leaves, Hopps learns from Wilde
that he was bullied by prey animals as a pup and became a criminal,
believing he would be stereotyped as one no matter what due to being a
fox.Wilde realizes that the city's traffic camera system may have captured
Manchas's disappearance, and the pair consult Assistant Mayor
Bellwether, a sheep. They identify the captors as wolves, hence "night
howlers". Hopps and Wilde locate the missing mammals (including Mr.
Otterton) at Hillside Asylum. All are predators, and all have gone
savage like Manchas. The two discover Mayor Lionheart consulting with a
doctor about the predators' condition. The pair escape with the
evidence and the police swarm the area, arresting Lionheart.Having developed a friendship with Wilde throughout the case, Hopps
requests that he joins the Zootopia Police Department and become her
partner, which Wilde happily considers. However, during a press
conference, Hopps mentions that the savage animals are predators and
argues they have gone back to their "natural state." Wilde is hurt and
angrily walks out on her offer. Fear and discrimination against
predators spreads across Zootopia, and a guilt-ridden Hopps resigns.
During this time, pop singer Gazelle holds a peaceful protest and
publicly asks for the harmonious Zootopia she loves to be restored.Back in Bunnyburrow, Hopps learns that "night howlers" are flowers that
have a severe psychotropic effects on mammals. Hopps returns to
Zootopia and reconciles with Wilde. They locate Weaselton and learn
that he has been collecting night howlers for a secret laboratory. The
pair discover the lab and find ram scientists creating a night howler
serum, which has been injected into predators via dart guns. Hopps and
Wilde race to the ZPD with the evidence, but the rams pursue them.Just short of the ZPD, the pair encounters Bellwether, who tries to
take the evidence. Realizing Bellwether is the mastermind of a
species-supremacist conspiracy, Hopps and Wilde try to flee, but
Bellwether shoots a dart at Wilde and calls the ZPD for help. Wilde
becomes savage and corners Hopps, but it turns out the pair were acting
and had swapped out Bellwether's darts for blueberries. With
Bellwether's confession recorded on Hopps's carrot pen, the two have
enough evidence to unravel the conspiracy.Some months later, Hopps is reinstated into the ZPD. The savaged
mammals are cured. Lionheart is cleared of all charges and is
reinstated as mayor. Wilde joins the ZPD as the first fox officer and
Judy's new partner. In the final scene, all of Zootopia enjoys a
performance by Gazelle, who dances with four tigers.

I was blown away by this. I didn't expect this movie to be like it was.
This film is not like it is being promoted, of course it is funny and a
little goofy... but it is way more than this. This movie has a lot to say about racism, drugs and other serious
issues in life and it succeeded in every way. This movie was not boring
one bit, the animations were hands down amazing and I got nothing else
to say but: Go and watch this movie you won't be disappointed.
Everything is completely thought through and there is a mind blowing
amount of detail here for you to see and all of this makes it worth
watching more than just one time only. A lot of people cried in my
theater, very emotional movie. Also: Great voice acting, extremely funny scene at the end.

From the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, the city of Zootopia
is a mammal metropolis where various animals live and thrive. When Judy
Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first rabbit to join the police
force, she quickly learns how tough it is to enforce the law.
Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the opportunity to solve a
mysterious case. Unfortunately, that means working with Nick Wilde
(Jason Bateman), a wily fox who makes her job even harder.I am absolutely sure Zootopia Will Be Number 1 In All Countries Of The
World Without Any Exaggeration.Since This Movie is The Production Of Disney,it has to be perfect.

Some movies perfectly personifies the past (Saving Private Ryan), some
movies predict the future (Fight Club), and some (like this one)
perfectly nail the current issues so accurately you feel like they
financed, wrote, and filmed the movie yesterday. Read the following
sentence slowly because you might not believe it the first time you
glance through it: Zootopia is the best film under the Walt Disney
Animation Studios banner since Emperor's New Groove, and is arguably
the most important animated film since Princess and the Frog. Yes, the
clock has to reach back 16 years before you can find a Disney Studios
animated film as strong as this one. Between the layers of intense
subject matter and a surprisingly strong mystery plot lies a beautiful
message for the kids and tweens that needs to be heard, especially
today. Nothing on the surface can actually prepare you for what happens once
you enter the setting of Zootopia. However, the surface is quite
delightful to look at. The animation is spectacularly detailed and
contributes mightily to the storyline about animals living together.
The main city itself branches off into several subdivisions, each with
its own distinctive personality. Unlike most Disney films, Zootopia
itself is so massive its practically begging for continuations through
film and television. It's an expansive visual feast of colors and
colorful characters, similar to the creative world of Wreck-It Ralph.
However, once the movie gets going you will quickly realize that
although it is a children's movie, there is plenty for teenagers and
even adults to laugh at and to be moved by. The mystery is slightly
more mature than what is expected, and we even reach quite dark
territory once the second half kicks into play. This is a children's
movie, but has an incredible script full of heart, soul, drama, and
necessary comedy to offset the bleakness. Using Pixar's collective
creativity technique (which has been rusting lately), we have three
directors and nearly a dozen writing credits attached (two wrote the
screenplay, many others contributed to the story). It is a miracle that
so many contributors to a single script made a film that flowed so
well. Disney and Pixar are the best at coming up with the required vocal
talents to bring the animated films to life, and this is no exception.
Jennifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are absolutely perfect for each
other and play to their strengths: Goodwin with her charming
all-American bubbliness and Bateman's sly hustling ways. They dominate
the film but luckily you'll learn to love them immediately through
their strengths and their flaws. And in keeping with recent tradition,
you won't know who the true villain is until later as the stakes start
getting higher.Rich Moore (most experienced of the three-director team) should be a
bigger name because his directing credits includes the early 90s
Simpsons and some of Futurama's greatest episodes. What those shows and
this film has in common is the electric mix of well-paced story, strong
characters, and shades of drama and commentary that speaks to the
current issues. Zootopia explores racism, sexism, classism, and
diversity fears better than any of the trailblazing Disney animated
films before it. That being said, it's not a knock on Princess and the
Frog, Mulan, or Hunchback of Notre Dame---the truth is Zootopia would
have never been fully greenlit by Disney in the 90s, and perhaps even
the 2000s. Disney has gotten gutsier and ballsier in recent years with the Too Big
to Fail attitude; and although the company definitely remains
officially mum on the current political turmoil, Zootopia can and
should be its resume and cover letter concerning what side of the fight
they are on. Zootopia is a daring animated film that will frighten you
(especially the youngsters), will emotionally hurt you, and will leave
you thinking long after Shakira's gazelle character lets out her final
note. It's the perfect concoction of mystery, comedy, action, and
social commentary that not only allows it to become an early entry for
Best Animated Feature, but (dare I say it), a Best Picture nomination. Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between
is essentially flawless. It has something for everyone, although the
youngest ones will struggle as it gets darker. Through its importance
as well as the engaging, ever-revolving plot, I give this film the
highest marks. Zootopia will stand as one of the best in all of 2016,
and among the best works of animation this entire decade. Disney has
unveiled its stance through adorable animals while simultaneously
proving that it remains the animation king of the world.

Zootopia is the best film of 2016 so far.Its also one of my favorite
animated movies of all time. I just love every second of this wonderful
and beautiful and funny film. Disney has been on a roll recently
starting with Wreck it Ralph, which I loved, Frozen another home run.
Big Hero 6 which was so creative although I didn't love it as much as
everyone else did. In my opinion Zootopia is the best of the lot. From
the many pop culture references to the beautiful animation, Zootopia is
a movie not just for kids but for adults as well. Please watch this
movie.I've watched it twice already and im so excited to see it again.
I Love this movie. ***** out of 5 stars.

There's no denying that Disney Animation Studios' output in current
years has been hit or miss, with Disney's best animated features being
those helmed by Pixar. I am happy to report that Zootopia can stand
toe-to-toe with most of Pixar's films. It starts with a great script.
This script is funny, very funny. But it is also relatable, heartfelt
and timely. There has been much discussion and praise of the films
messages of embracing diversity and not giving up on one's dreams.
While that latter message is a common theme in most family fare, the
points the film makes about diversity couldn't be coming along at a
better time. Many of us watch the news and see the stories of unarmed
minorities being harmed or killed by police officers, or protests over
the Oscars' lack of nominee diversity, and we realize there is truth
and relevance to many of these issues. But how often do we stop to
think about how our kids are responding to these things? They often
watch, read and hear the same news we do. The main theme of Zootopia is
not judging others based on their "species" and avoiding common
misconceptions and stereotypes about anyone who may not come from the
same origins you do. Admittedly, the movie beats this point more than a
dirty rug (a skunk-butt-rug perhaps? You'll see.). But it doesn't
interfere at all with the movie's enjoyment factor. Aside from an
extremely witty script, we have a well-cast group of actors bringing
life to a plethora of unique new characters. In the lead is Ginnifer
Goodwin as Judy Hopps, Zootopia's first bunny cop. One thing that set
Disney's classics apart was their creation of unique and memorable
characters. Think Genie from Aladdin, Dopey from Snow White, the White
Rabbit from Alice In Wonderland or Timon & Pumba from The Lion
King-characters that have thrived in the pop culture ether long after
their movies' releases. Judy Hopps is one of Disney's best new
characters in years and she deserves to be every bit as memorable as
those others I mentioned. She could have thrived on the cute factor
alone, but she is much more three-dimensional than that. She has
experienced real bullying and prejudice in her life but insists on
enduring through whatever others throw at her so she can become a cop
and "make the world a better place". She's clever, funny and even a
little flawed, making her easy to connect with and root for. Jason
Bateman costars as the sly fox Nick Wilde, who must learn throughout
the film to look past his cynical view of the world and his own selfish
attitude. As a Jason Bateman fan, I was glad to see him lending his
famously sarcastic tone to this project. In his character's first few
scenes I wasn't sure he was the right fit, but once Wilde and Hopps
partner up, his range kicks in as his character faces a new emotional
journey. The supporting cast includes Idris Elba, Bonnie Hunt, Tommy
Chong, J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Maurice Lamarche,
Jenny Slate and Shakira as a pop star named Gazelle who treats us to a
fun concert during the end credits. Nate Terrance gets one of the
film's best supporting roles as Clawhauser, the police department's
front desk officer-a fat, goofy, over-the-top, donut-loving cheetah. He
and Judy get one of the best scenes in the movie when he uses a certain
word to describe her and she responds with a friendly "only bunnies can
use that word" attitude. It is obvious what real world scenario this
scene is mirroring, and it is a very clever part of the movie's
diversity message. All these characters are part of the movie's great
mystery-why has there been a disappearance of multiple mammals, and
why, in an evolved society where all animals live in supposed harmony,
are some animals turning "savage" and attacking others? I certainly
won't spoil it here; and while the big reveal may be a tad predictable,
it fits the film well. The pacing is near perfect, never does the movie
feel like it's dragging or rushed. The sloths at the DMV scene featured
in the film's second trailer is probably the funniest scene in the
movie. However, there is a little more to it and even though I had
already seen it multiple times, it still brought me to tears laughing
in the theater. Thankfully, there's plenty more great lines and gags
throughout to keep the laughs coming. Obviously, with any animated
feature, the quality of the animation is an important factor. Zootopia
looks great. It may not be jaw-dropping like The Good Dinosaur, but all
the images are well drawn and crisply rendered. There is also nice
attention to detail throughout-little things like the carrots on Bonnie
Hopps' skirt, Judy's activity tracker watch, and Mrs. Otterton's
thread-pilling sweater. Characters' fur looks to stand out and flow
naturally. It is clear directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush
and their animation team set out to make a visually satisfying movie
experience that doesn't skimp on animation quality. Disney should be
proud of their latest effort. Zootopia works well not just as a
animated movie or family film-but just as a good movie period. I
certainly wouldn't oppose going to see it again. It works on multiple
levels and should be appealing to the whole family. 9/10

To put it in the most succinct way possible, Zootopia is an absolute
marvel both in scale and in execution. Disney's 55th animated film may
honestly be it's best. I realize this sounds like hyperbole but I
cannot lie, Zootopia may frankly be the most complete, organic,
emotionally resonant, socially relevant, incredibly funny film to ever
come out of Disney aka the studio that has pretty much monopolized on
our entertainment.If ever there was a textbook definition of an upstart it would be Judy
Hopps (Goodwin). Undaunted by the discouragement around her, Judy
dreams of becoming a police officer in Zootopia, the city where
predator and prey live in harmony. It's easier said than done, in fact
not one of her species, nor any species smaller than a wolf, has ever
made it through the Police Academy. She however finds a way and
achieves her dream...only to become a meter maid. As she struggles to
become an asset to the force, trouble brews in the city as predators
start to disappear. Judy has a hunch concerning one of the predators
and recruits the unwilling Nick Wilde (Bateman) a fox with a knack for
getting into trouble.One of the first things I immediately noticed about this film coming in
was the humor, which while certainly filled with corny animal jokes, is
organic to the characters and the situations. There are no unnecessary
and useless comic-relief characters or smug jabs meant to up the
snark-factor. In-fact some of the humor is so subtle yet brilliant that
it kind of washes over you. Take for example Judy's neighbors, two male
bushbucks which immediately inform her they're loud and are heard
sparring in their apartment. This joke will go far over the heads of
children and adults alike but it's still there in the details.There's also detail in the complex relationships between the
characters. Predator and prey are said to get along in Zootopia but
Judy slowly realizes that that bond can easily be disrupted. Predators
are a minority in the city generalized as aggressive and in the case of
foxes, sneaky. There is certainly a subtext here and Disney has no
problem with mirroring contemporary notions of racism and sexism and
intertwining it's themes with the narrative of the story. In any other
story a rabbit and a fox would be mortal enemies but in this case Judy
and Nick become fast friends as they solve a convoluted crime.There are many moments I found myself rolling on the floor with
laughter while simultaneously in awe at the mosaic the dream-makers at
Disney have created. Any other year, a movie of this kind would have
been a high-watermark of entertainment yet in the era of
#blacklivesmatter and unabated police brutality, Zootopia has reached
new heights. Zootopia has latched onto the zeitgeist of modern America
like few movies ever have. To my recollection, only Spider-Man (2002)
has achieved a similar balance between light and airy entertainment and
seizing the moment to become something more. Just replace the
uncertainty of post-9/11 America with the uncertainty of post- Ferguson
America and you got the perfect movie for the times. One that is equal
amounts of hope and optimism.I love this movie. It's beautifully rendered, smartly executed, and
shockingly timely. The vocal cast is unparalleled with Goodwin and
Bateman providing the best performances in an animated movie since
Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter in The Incredibles (2004). Disney is
world renowned for it's ability to give quality family entertainment
and do so with a stunning sense of grace. Zootopia only continues that
trend and does so while resonating with audiences in a manner few films
dare to. Watch Zootopia with the entire family then, on your day off,
watch it again; it's that good.

I'm an adult who generally likes action and sci-fi movies. I'll go for
an animated movie if I it has great reviews and people say it's
enjoyable for adults. That was the case here and - yes, the movie is
great and appeals to all ages.It's basically a story about evolved animals that live in a harmonious,
modern-age city called "Zootopia". It's "harmonious" because predators
and prey live and work together without stereotypes and labels. Well -- that's what everyone wants to believe, but reality is a bit
more messy. This is what a young female bunny named Judy learns when
she pursues her dream to become a police officer. It may sound a bit corny and adolescent, but the story isn't. It's
well-written with clever dialog, an engaging plot mystery and likable
characters. Plus, "Zootopia" is like this big world with different zones or
habitats for different types of animal species. It's pretty cool.The only thing I didn't really like is that much of film is too dark
(visually) with gloomy skies and a general lack of vibrant colors.
Greater color contrast would have been great. Could have been the
theater, but the 3D and normal versions both seemed to look this way. That notwithstanding, I'd say this will be a good bet for kids and most
adults. If you enjoy movies like Shrek and the Lego Movie - definitely
consider watching this one.

Who says family films only have children to preach to? Well, actually
I'm not entirely sure if anyone's ever said that, but it sure sounds
like they would though, huh? That debate aside, Disney gets it with its
newest installment. Without sounding clichÃ© and trite, Zootopia is
literally fun for the whole family. It takes place in a world where animals, both predator and prey, live
together in harmony-- except not really. Although things have seemed to
change, all the animals still have their reservations and fears about
one another. Obviously mirroring a place where our own society is right
now, as far as race and religion. The whole movie features various species facing intolerance, while
digging into and showcasing possible responses to the prejudices
against them--perhaps containing the true depth within this film. The
themes are obvious to the adults, but subliminal to the kids. Which is
a good thing. It deals with a dark subject matter, and the filmmakers
aren't afraid to give us that respective tone either.The main character is Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny
rabbit who is finally living her dream of being a police officer in the
big city. But she faces adversity since the job is usually held by
rhinos or elephants. She's given a case where she has to find an otter
who's gone missing--a mystery that adds another fun feature to an
already interesting concept. However, it doesn't come until about 35
minutes in--right when you're starting to wonder to yourself what the
setup is for.In a refreshing fashion, the writers aren't talking down to their
younger audience. It's funny without being over-the-top and irreverent.
When the jokes don't work as well, it's never in an embarrassing way.
In fact, there may even be more jokes for the adults in this one.
However, there are plenty of aesthetic visuals to keep the children
entertained for the full runtimeAnimation alone, Zootopia is beautifully detailed. There's so much of
it that it's not even possible to see it all in one sitting. And while
you're watching it, you wish there were a place just like it where you
could visit as soon as the movie finishes.Twizard Rating: 99

In 2013, while following the D23 Expo from home, Zootopia was first
announced and it seemed very appealing. I dreaded the long wait to see
what Rich Moore and Byron Howard (the director of Wreck-It Ralph with
some Simpsons work, and the director of both Bolt and Tangled) would
cook up in this film.When the trailers started to come out, I was charmed. When the plot
began to unveil, I realized that the relationships between characters
and species in this film would apply pretty seamlessly with
stereotypes. I was shocked and excited at the possibility that Disney
would be making a film that addressed racism as well as stereotypes,
and I had some fear that the film would not be so accepted because of
this.Fast forward to opening weekend, almost 3 years later. I've been
following this film ever since 2013, and I am beyond excited to see it
with my friends. The theater isn't completely packed, but still pretty
full. We had originally planned to go to a 7 pm showing, but it was
sold out, so we ended up going to an 8 pm showing instead. Practically
everything I had heard about this movie was good, which fueled my
excitement even greater. Then the actual movie came.Wow. Wow wow wow wow wow. I knew that it was already great, but being
there, and seeing the unveiled world of Zootopia in full cinematic
experience with a lively crowd around you made a very fun adventure,
and a world that I am already seeking to return to. I am not sure if I will ever contemplate how much backbreaking work
those animators put themselves through to incorporate natural animal
movements in these characters as well as putting detail in the
surroundings and the city itself. This city, this design alone is worth
paying the money in a cinema. It is so immersing and layered with
clever tricks and adaptations for all sorts of animals living there.
Yeah, and it also looks great with state of the art animation. With a
world this big, Disney could have their first real saga.Then there's the cast. Byron and Howard were right in casting Ginnifer
Goodwin and Jason Bateman. The two work so well together as Judy Hopps
and Nick Wilde. They are well developed, which works in all movies, not
just Disney alone. This film also introduced me to Idris Elba's acting,
and his performance as Chief Bogo is really good, and he has a secret
that had me in stitches. There's so much more about the cast I could
say, but this review would go on longer than it already has, and I want
anyone who hasn't seen it to find out some points on their own.Also. The Writing and the Humor. Both are solid. This movie has a
really good script, and still manages to make us howl (pun intended)
with laughter despite its mature themes. And there is one moment in the
film of where the look on Nick's face is undeniably one of the best
things I have ever seen in my life. Although this is a movie that the whole family can enjoy, it isn't for
the faint-hearted kids, and I think that parents should be ready for
discussing its themes. If you don't have kids, you might be pondering
this movie's messages yourself for days. And my one complaint? There's
a certain little character that doesn't even get nearly enough screen
time. I won't say who, but I think you'll know when you see it.So altogether, I will say what I said about this on my Facebook. This
movie is absolutely fantastic. It has beautiful animation, awesome
world building, great comedy and action, a wonderful cast and a sweet
yet powerful story that resembles our struggles with discrimination and
inclusive societies. Those critics were not kidding, and neither am I.This is why I love Disney. They don't create films for just children.
They create films that rock its audiences to the core and connects them
while staying wholly original, brilliant and effective without any
actual actors or sets. That's the magic of animation. I applaud this
company for taking this brave risk making a movie that addresses
present issues as powerful as these, and I wholeheartedly encourage
anyone who hasn't seen this film to do so ASAP. I know I will be going
back.

I walked into this movie completely blind; I had no idea what it was
about, I had not watched any trailers, I have barely even heard of the
movie beforehand. Boy, was I surprised.Zootopia's concept is very interesting; in a world full of animals, a
bunny by the name of Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), who had a
dream of becoming the first bunny police officer in the urban
megalopolis of Zootopia. Despite being the valedictorian of her class
in her police schooling, she was made fun of by her coworkers due to
her size and was given parking duty as her first job. While on the job,
she meets a fox named Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), who, while
sly and deceptive at first, ends up helping Judy investigate a case of
a missing citizen otter, a case that Judy took up on her own and was
not formally assigned to. This case then escalates into a crazy
conspiracy that is greatly affecting Zootopia, a conspiracy that Judy
and Nick must solve together.The chemistry of Goodwin and Bateman are incredible; they work
beautifully together as the two main characters of the film. Although
Bateman's character is shown as a villain at the beginning of the film,
once the film starts to uncover, you learn to like him more and more.Even the smaller sub-characters are very enjoyable. Maurice LaMarche's
character, Mr. Big, is a hilarious Mafia-like crime boss; as an
Italian, I found LaMarche's character possible the most enjoyable
character in the entire film; with The Godfather and other Mafia
references, it was a great addition to the film's plot. Clawhauser, a
radio dispatcher and receptionist for the Zootopia Police Department
voiced by Nate Torrence is extremely lovable the moment the film
introduces the viewer to him. Flash, the sloth working in the DMV
(Department of Mammal Vehicles) is also a hilarious character voiced by
The Simpsons director Raymond S. Persi. There are even more great voice
actors that make for one hell of a cast.The animation is absolutely stunning. It is insane how much detail was
put into the art of this film; it almost looks like real life! Some of
the best animation I've ever seen in a film. As an adult, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. Even with its G rating,
it has an immersive plot with plenty of scenes that will have you
laughing, and then soon after have you on the edge of your seat. I
wouldn't even consider it a children's movie; there are multiple
concepts and references that young children would not get. I was very
surprised how suspenseful the film could be at times. Disney killed it yet again. Zootopia is one of the best films they've
ever put out, and perhaps one of the best animated films to ever be
made. This is a film that almost anyone can enjoy. Don't let the cutesy
appearance fool you; Zootopia is a beautiful, suspenseful, funny and
deep film. I will personally be disappointed if this does not win an
Academy Award.

My boyfriend and I decided to give this movie a try because the
previews looked good. It was one of those movies we weren't super
excited about seeing, but we didn't think it would be an entire waste
of time.We were happy we went. It was well worth its 108 minutes' length.This movie was wonderful. It kept our interest throughout every
thrilling, comical, emotional, unraveling moment. We like to predict
the movies we see as it unfolds before us. Even though this is a "kids"
movie, it kept surprising us with its twists and turns. The voice
acting was spot on; Ginnifer and Jason were a delightful duo. The CGI
was lovely to see, and the plot was never dull. If you and your family
are looking for some great entertainment, look no further. This is a
movie we'll be buying as soon as it comes out on DVD. If Zootopia is
any indication of this year's animation films, we're in for exciting
year full of potential.

If you want your kids to "laugh out loud" during the movie but can
learn something after it as well,this is the right movie for your
family. People of all ages can see themselves in "Zootopia" because the
characters both have the typical features of animals and the familiar
traits of any human being. The film isn't wrong to say that carnivores
are biologically inclined to want to eat herbivores, that bunny
reproduce prolifically, the sloths are slow-moving, that you can take
the fox out of the forest but you can't take the forest out of the fox.
If you think about all this as an analogy for the world we live in and
then ask yourself which ethnic or racial or societal groups are
"predators" (cops,businessmen,bureaucrats) and which are "prey",you see
the problem. "Zootopia" rubber stamps whatever world-view parents want
to pass on to their kids,however embracing or malignant that may be. I
can imagine an anti-racist and a racist coming out of the movie,each
thinking it validates their sense of how the world works. "Only a bunny can call another bunny 'cute'" or "Never let them see
that they get to you". "Zootopia" constantly asks its characters to
look past stereotypes and not use sexist or racist language or repeat
hurtful assumptions. This strongly reminded me of the case at Yale
University during Halloween and the protest of its students about
freedom of free-speech. Furthermore,"Zootopia" is visually stunning and full of cute animals
with big eyes and voices of celebrities. The "Zootopia" canvas pops
thanks to a gorgeously vibrant color palette and whimsical
architectural scales. An all-mammal parallel universe is comprised of
distinct micro-climates like sunny Bunnyburrows,icy Tundratown and
self-explanatory Little Rodentia. Shakira's "Try Everything" is catchy
and smartly relevant to the movie. It will never gain the level of
popularity that "Let It Go" did, but I believe your kids will come out
of the movie singing this song joyfully. As it is,"Zootopia" is a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that
kids of this generation should adore,at least at the level that they
did with "Frozen" and "Big Hero 6".

All my family just watched it, we cry and laugh all the time!!! After
the movie, we even didn't want to leave. We decide to watch it again with more friends!!!Cute Fox and Bunny couple!!!All the best!!!I was short, so I totally understand what short Bunny will feel when
she meet tall and strong people. When I see she practices at night, I
cry a lot. Thank you Disney!!!We usually treat others as Sterotype, it is wrong. That is bias, and we
should treat others equally.And try everything!!! I love the music!!!

In 1992, cartoonist Art Spiegelman won the Pulitzer Prize for Maus,
which appropriated cuddly, anthropomorphic animals (not at all unlike
Disney creatures) for a parable about racism, discrimination, and
survival, circa WWII. Flash-forward 24 years, and we finally have
Disney's rebuttal. And those years have been good to the House of
Mouse, now enough of a franchise super-giant to fire off quirky B-tier
flicks like Zootopia, confident enough to surpass Disney's usual
standard of impeccable visuals and emotional storytelling to also
really be About Something. Zootopia is razor-sharp, outrageously
clever, bustling with urgent thematic subtext, and heartfelt enough to
reach the realm of Disney classics sure to be heralded as essential
canonical viewing for generations of children and adults henceforth.Following (the vastly inferior) The Good Dinosaur as the second
consecutive Disney release championing a thriving societal
infrastructure where humans don't exist (hmm...), Zootopia is a
dazzlingly dense and textured realm almost too detailed to take in at
first glance, forcing cinema viewers to acclimatize to the consistent
unrequited urge to pause and contemplate. When our protagonist, earnest
Officer Hopps (magnificently emotive, infectiously giddy Ginnifer
Goodwin), arrives at Zootopia, the film is content to momentarily
become a travelogue, drinking in, in a sweeping pan shot, the regions,
and size/species/climate sub-communities of the city. Don't worry,
though - we'll get to revisit them all later). Before you can think of
a better pun than "face the yaks", Zootopia has transformed into a
buddy (or should I say BUNNY - I thought of one!) cop mystery
adventure. As Hopps pairs with irrepressible con-fox Nick Wilde (Jason
Bateman at his most laconic, smugly hilarious), they dive into a romp
full of hilarity, exhilarating sequences (including a slew of
chases/tussles highlighting the unique physicality of each animal
present), and thematic mediation on xenophobia, ideology, and societal
power hierarchies. Y'know - kid stuff.Zootopia isn't subtle about being just as issue-driven as story-driven,
but nor should it be. Here, the parable of civilized mammals 'going
savage' (an interesting contribution to the nature/nurture debate in
itself) serves as the perfect catalyst to ignite age-old discriminatory
tensions between tenuously co-habitating predator and prey (including
some genuinely upsetting sequences), in a fashion perfectly suited to
contextualize privilege, racism, and wage and influence-gaps to
children - heck, even for adults. But in case that gets too heavy (and
Zootopia, while jaunty and fast-paced, has its fair share of vintage
Disney darkness), it's tempered with some on-point one- liners to
snarkily soften the blow ("a bunny can call another bunny cute, but you
can't"/"you can't just touch a sheep's wool!!"), with only the
occasional clunky line reeking of kid-friendly rewrites to distract
from the revelry. For the kids, there are more Frozen and other Disney
nods than you can count (including a genius Alan Tudyk cameo I'll
weasel out of spoiling here). For the adults: inspired nudist colony
gags, and riffs on the Godfather and Breaking Bad. And yes: that sloth
DMV scene is just as funny in theatres as in the umpteen trailers
you've seen it in. Trust me.Still, amidst all the ideas, heart, and cutting dialogue, the voice
cast are what really hit home. Apart from the superb Goodwin and
Bateman, who share delightfully sparky, and sometimes surprisingly
emotional banter, the distinctive boom of Idris Elba and bark of J.K.
Simmons lend welcome support, while Jenny Slate mumbles so many (yup,
I'm going there) sheepish witticisms in the background she's almost
worth a second viewing singlehandedly.Zootopia doesn't quite hit the soaring, transcendent emotional heights
associated with classic Lion King/Beauty and the Beast era Disney
(though many of its smaller moments are just as poignant and
well-orchestrated in their own way), as it's really its own (guffaw)
animal. But, as a snappier, more expansive, socially conscious cousin,
it's still an essential addition to the Disney family, and one that
almost insists upon revisiting, if only to properly do justice to.
Rich, vibrant, and clever enough to make audiences young and old
(night)howl with laughter, Zootopia is the confident work of a peerless
studio operating at the top of their game, and necessary viewing as
cinema, far surpassing mere animated entertainment.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be off trying to beat that stupidly
catchy Shakira chorus out of my head. I moose be rid of it; I can
bearly stand it!(...I really otter stop now. But rhino want to. I'd say it's an
ox-ident, but you're a shrew-d reader, and I know you wouldn't take
that lion down.)-9.5/10

Zootopia (2016): Dir: Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush / Voices:
Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate
Torrence: Fascinating and creative take on animals within a human
society where they co-exist as one while interacting in a human like
lifestyle. Judy Hopps is a bunny with big dreams. She desires to
venture to Zootopia to become the first ever bunny recruit cop. She
succeeds despite obstacles but is given the task of meter maid. Central
plot regards missing predators and a conspiracy that regards them
returning to their wild savage old lifestyles. Hopps is joined in her
search by Nick Wilde, a con artist fox who reluctantly assists Hopps
when she catches him within his own scam. There are animals abound
every frame from biggest to smallest. Chief Bogo is a cape buffalo who
barks orders and gives Hopps only a small amount of time to crack this
case. There is the lion mayor and the lamb secretary, which makes for a
great play on the opposite ends of the hunting scale that is
non-existent in this culture. It is never clear what the predators eat
but we do have an overweight cat at the front desk at the police
station who knows where the donuts are. The animation is colorful and
full of life and personality but the real surprise is a screenplay that
is both entertaining for children while being extremely clever in terms
of plot devices. The theme is tolerance and how we need to learn to
accept others despite their faults just as Hopps learns when she must
put away the fox repellant and just view Nick as another living
creature with hopes and dreams. Score: 10 / 10

I normally only use the term "delightful" when referring to my 2 year
old granddaughter, but this film deserves it. The animated story about
a bunny named Judy Hopps who aspires to "make the world a better place"
(by becoming a police officer in Zootopia) is heartwarming and
hilarious.Of course, animation today is breathtaking and this movie is no
exception. My wife and I agreed that one of our favorite parts of the
show was the train ride into Zootopia - which displays many different
ecosystems and wildly different climates. It is spectacular.But this is both a character and message driven story. The main
character Judy is lovable, but resolute in her desire to improve the
world she lives in. It is wonderful to see her bounce back from
betrayals, trials and tribulations. And even when she experiences
success, acclaim and fame - her character is tested - and she comes out
on top. You really need to see it to know what I am talking about.A number of different movie genres are utilized: a mystery, detective
story with homages to "The Godfather" and "Breaking Bad" are all very
cleverly done. The movie also addresses the effects of prejudice and
fear - and the way they can destroy relationships. The message for children (and adults) is strong about not giving up
your dream - even when all those around you are doubting you - and even
trying to make you fail. Humor that adults can also enjoy has become a staple of movies like
these - and Zootopia hits a home run in this area. There are many funny
lines throughout the movie, but the scene at the Dept of Motor Vehicles
made the entire audience laugh out loud. It was my wife's and my
favorite.In all the years I have been reviewing movies that I love (or hate),
this is the first animated film I have reviewed. My 9 year and 5 year
old grandchildren loved it - as did my wife and I. We walked out of the
film saying "We cannot wait to buy this movie!" Need I say more?

Once upon a time, predatory animals were either the sinister villains
or the square-jawed heroes of Disney Animated films, with the cuddly
animals ("prey" if I'd go further) being either comic relief or the
central protagonist. With "Zootopia", where anthropomorphic mammals
live and breathe in a bustling metropolis ala humans (with nary a homo
sapien in sight), the tables have turned - cuddly animals such as our
heroine, a rabbit cop named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) has shifted
into figures of empowerment and inspiration, while big predatory
animals have become either the cute ones - as seen in an overweight
man-child cheetah cop who obsesses over a famous pop star while on desk
duty - or a mischievous comic relief as per con-artist fox Nick Wilde
(Jason Bateman).Wilde is the archetypal wily fox Â– there's not a word that he says that
isn't cynical or sarcastic. Although the character is animated, this is
essentially Bateman being his laid-back self, which strongly anchors
this film down to earth. Wilde provides a pleasant foil against
Goodwin's Hopps, who is eager to do good (not unlike co- director Rich
Moore's "Wreck-It Ralph") and make Zootopia a better place, but
constantly finds her naivetÃ© not only challenged by Wilde's put- downs,
but also by her own parents' over-protectiveness and even the Zootopia
police chief, a bison (voiced by Idris Elba) and caricature of the
stereotypical cop-movie chief, who bluntly tells Hopps that being a cop
"isn't some fairy tale with songs and dance. Let it go."Indeed, "Zootopia" is not the usual Disney fare Â– the similarity ends
with the talking animals, extremely likable characters and rapid- fire
humor Â– I lost it in numerous scenes, particularly an adorable riff on
"The Godfather" Â– that will entertain kids and adults alike. What we
have here is essentially a buddy cop movie (think "48 Hrs", "Rush
Hour", "Lethal Weapon") that skirts into noir territory at times -
where one's a do-gooder cop and the other's a rebel, and they both team
up to stop a bigger threat towards the city, bonding in the process.
The Disney version, at least. Spoilers ahead.How this leads into a political conspiracy involving a plot to
segregate the prey from predators, I will not reveal. Here Disney makes
a bold move, not only subverting their decades-old predator/prey animal
tropes, but not-so-subtly confronting the media blitz against
race-induced crimes. I am instantly reminded of the American media who
gobble up any news involving multi-racial crimes and subsequent
controversies with law enforcement, with no qualms given to either side
of the fence to express their proper opinion. Howard and Moore, along
with their writers, remarkably handle their material sensibly and
level-headedness Â– and with Disney's lesson of the movie Â– about
acceptance and unity, delivered with care.This could be one of the year's best films.

Some recent animated films, like How to Train Your Dragon or Inside
Out, combine visual appeal and strong moral or psychological insight.
Zootopia does a little, but mostly it's a great looking film with a
good, complex plot and very, very, funny. The different environments
are nicely realized, especially where the two heroes, small by
Zootopian standards, cross over into the rodent habitat and become
giants who have to avoid crushing things. If you were going to make a
movie about mammals living as humans, who would you have staffing the
DMV? (Remember, turtles aren't mammals) Well, Zootopia nails it,
hilariously. There are homages to The Godfather and Breaking Bad. The
end credits rave scene is a tour de force of animation. A total blast.

Disney's most recent Animated Classic Zootopia is already a giant hit,
critically and financially. Its mixture of broad humor, undeniable
spirit, and timely / timeless themes of inclusivity and acceptance make
it easy to see why. Is Zootopia's message a bit on-the-nose? Oh, yeah.
(What's the exaggerated version of that term? IN Â–the nose?
FROM-the-nose? The-nose-itself?). At times that insistence to wear its
thoughts on its sleeve can be distracting. However, this is
morally-upstanding entertainment made for children, and if we remember
that, it becomes not only enjoyable but even admirable. Judy Hopps
(Goodwin) is at the center of this fish-out-of-water (better yet,
bunny-out-of-town) tale, as Zootopia's (a species-melding-pot
metropolis) first rabbit police officer on her first case, helped by
conniving-insider fox Nick. What follows is a mystery tale that, while
juvenile, is full of fun references and absolutely amazing
world-building. At times, it may test your limits on animal-based
wordplay, but its ubiquitous cuteness (a term coined "offensive to the
bunny community") and strongly expressive animation make it difficult
to dislike. Along the journey, we encounter numerous classes of
animals, each representing both the silly stereotypes of their
"animal-race", while smartly standing in for human biases and
prejudices. What's truly noble about that blunt messaging is it doesn't
deny the disparities between us or claim that "color-blindness" is the
path to a less-bigoted world. It's more an indictment of fear as a
means of power, something we know all too well, encouraging us to
recognize our differences and use them as a support instead of a
weight. On-the-nose or not, that is a message worth implanting in every
American, both child and adult.

This is the best animation I've seen in a long time. This will probably
go down as one of Disney's best. It was funny, it was witty, it was
cleverly written and it had a very good message."Zootopia" is not the first anthropomorphic Disney movie. Just about
every Disney movie gives human qualities and characteristics to
animals, cars, planes, etc. This movie was unique in that it united the
entire mammal world in one (seemingly) harmonious location. But what
looked like harmony from a distance had some underlying ugly but
accepted societal norms.Beneath the beautiful exterior was stereotyping and making sweeping
statements to encompass entire species. Those remarks could easily have
been applied to the same situations we face as human beings trying to
live with one another.If the conflict of the movie could be summarized it would've been with
one scene. There was one particular discourse between Judy Hopps
(Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit, and her parents. She'd gotten attacked by
a fox and her parents' statement was something to the effect that all
foxes were jerks. Her response was that he was a jerk that happened to
be a fox.The movie was replete with the message of inclusion and forgoing
stereotypes and bigotry. It was a very positive movie that was cleverly
written and offered plenty of laughs.

Zootopia is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, and Jared Bush. It's
stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba and much more great
actors and actresses. First off, going into this movie I thought it was
going to be a good Disney, not excepting anything special but I was
completely wrong. Zootopia is one of Disney best movies yet, it has
lots of depth, didn't rely on poop jokes it had a story and it focused
on the story. The animation was beautiful to look at. The voice acting
was fantastic by everyone. Jason Bateman was fantastic for the role
perfect. The thing that I was most surprised by in this movie is the
depth. There are a lot of hidden messages about our world today, what's
going on and that's what makes this movie a great movie for both kids
and parents. Overall zootopia was a great surprise by Disney, one of
their best movies yet. Had great jokes,heart and a good story.
Definitely go and check this movie in theaters.

First of all I thought this movie will end up with such a predictable
plot. After thinking through while watching this movie, it has
subliminal messages that says about racism, fascism, corruption,
prejudice, and a lot of stuff that are not suitable for kids. Since
it's okay because no kids will understand that.They're just laughing
about a cuteness of the animals in this movie. Haha. So well, this
movie is great, enjoyable, stunning animation! Best animation movie
2016 so far. Thanks Disney! Keep doing this kind of movie! I'll wait
for that! And hell yeah, this is even better than Kung Fu Panda 3!
Sorry Po! Skedoosh!

I heard a lot of great things about this movie, not only from the
critics or this website but also from some of my friends living abroad
and who had the chance to see this movie weeks before me.So when it was finally released over here, I wanted to look by myself
alongside one of my friends and her two children. And I loved it too.The first thing to say is Zootopia is a typical Disney Movie. It has
this fairy side we find in each of their pictures, symbolized by this
huge metropolis called Zootopia. It's a magical combination of several
worlds connected to each other where animals of each sort, preys as
predators, live in harmony and peace which is by the way another
favorite Disney Theme.It has also this huge dose of cuteness throughout the characters of the
movie starting with Judy, this cute young doe which wishes to be the
first of her kind becoming a police officer. Something she succeeds to
achieve through hard work and dedication, another familiar Disney theme
(You can achieve anything if you believe in yourself). The other
characters are as attaching especially Flash, a very funny sloth who is
really irresistible in each scene he appears. Nick, Judy's partner is
as adorable as her under his attitude of a tough guy is secretly hiding
a fear of being rejected because he's a fox.But there is also something new, something we never see in a Disney
cartoon before: The police investigation side. It's unexpectedly
thrilling with its very noire ambiance, its characters scarier than
usual but which still includes a certain sense of parody. As it's a
Disney movie, nobody dies but it's still thrilling following Judy and
Nick into their investigation which is very well built. I truly hope
this side will be including in the next Disney movies.When the movie was finally over, I had a very great time and judging by
how my friend's children were cheering and wishing to become cops when
they'll be older, I can safely assume they did as well. It deserves the
rave reviews it received worldwide. Zootopia is definitely a great
surprise and a picture to see if you wish to enjoy an amazing family
time.

Fresh from Disney is one of the newest largely anticipated release to
add to the collection of classics released over the decades. In
Zootopia, there is a world full of animals where humans never happened,
naturally the animals evolved over the years and formed societies of
their own. The actual city of 'Zootopia' is not the only such places as
there are multiple smaller towns surrounding the metropolis, Judy Hopps
being from Bunny Borough herself, but there is an implicit tone that
there are other small communities similar to that one all over the
world. Without getting into any plot to avoid spoilers, the overall
message of this movie is acceptance and overcoming obstacles. Being set
in a fictional world with many different species and backgrounds of
animals, a primary focus is dealing with various xenophobic tendencies.
Everyone faces certain species-ist reactions and societal views, but
being Disney they chose a positive message for the overall tone. Like
the old classics such as Robin Hood or The Aristocats, it deals with
issues that exist in the real world while not being reminiscent of
them. While prejudice and xenophobia do also exist in our world, the
problems and feelings found in Zootopia are all their own. Being set in
a fiction the films character and plot are all self contained and you
don't need to be privy to any particular issues of our time. Personally
it was refreshing to see a movie with a clear message of good will
without referring to ongoing real world issues which would cloud our
judgment or try to over analyse the plot. After seeing it a few times I
enjoyed it even more and found the message of moving forward and making
the world a better place suitable for all ages, both the young who want
to feel good about the world, and the older who can appreciate the
absolute hopefulness found in the endearing characters and their
relations. At the end of the day this is a feel-good romp around a
vibrant and fresh world which will undoubtedly be cherished by all ages
for the years to come.

This movie scared the living daylights out of my 3 and 4 year old. The
content was not really funny (It had a couple of spots but they were
few and far between). The worst part of the movie was a Silence of the
Lambs Insanity Ward where the beasts were kept. (Remember Jody Foster
getting semen thrown at her) My children cried and we left the theater
when the (spoiler alert, near the end) . The movie should be rated PG13
as the themes were more suited to teenagers who could handle aggressive
animals, mob mentality of killing someone, New York style hardcore
sarcasm where no one cares about anyone, and Meth lab where an insane
looking sheep in an DU HAST video with air breather is making "night
howler" I am a guy that has seen his fair share of freaky, and I love a
good movie (going for Apocalypse Now tonight) BUT this show is not for
kids, and I am aghast that Disney put it out. I remember enjoying the
time of Toy Story, Nemo, Hero 6, Wall-e, Up and great Disney Movies
(Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar from the "other guys") This movie was to
deep in subject matter and the message was for teenagers and not little
children.

Usually Disney means that it lacks a certain edge or quality that makes
it 'safe' or palatable for all audiences. While Zootopia is certainly
another big blockbuster for the studio, and especially for the
filmmakers and animators who have been behind many of the smash
successes of the past 10 years (starting with Meet the Robinsons up
through now, when John Lasseter took over), it's not a movie with
talking animals something that is dumbed down or has a message that
gets obfuscated by too much (dumb) goofball comedy (I'm looking at you,
Ice Age and Madagascar sequels). This is actually about something in
the same way, not quite up to this level but in the same ballpark, as
Watership Down or The Fox and the Hound - though the former is
certainly darker than this and the latter a little sweeter and more
grounded (much as it can be) in the real world, Zootopia is an
excellent example of using animals to convey a message about where we
are at today.The film might eschew the current horrors of police brutality (hey, it
is ultimately a movie that kids can enjoy, and that might be a lot to
take in as far as an animated movie with animals), but it is really
impactful about telling a good message about a complicated subject: how
does the "melting pot" work? What happens when groups of people - or
animals - converge in one city and have to interact with one another?
What happens if the thing that separates the animals, acting without
the human qualities (or like savage/aggressive beasts) is amplified to
create tensions? And what happens when someone who doesn't fit in has the veracity and
intelligence and just will-power to rise to the top of something tries
to be accepted in a society where he (or in this case also primarily
she) doesn't fit in? What I liked in the movie, aside from it having a
very clever police procedural plot (which gets in jokes at the expense
of The Godfather, which is nothing new but is done with a very funny
Don Corleone parody in a tiny rat, and hippie-"nude" yoga-ists), is
that it is generally about addressing what it means to be the "other"
in a society. It never comes outright and says "it's about racism"
point-blank, but it shows it even in something like scale.Some animated films may not pay or draw too much attention to how
animals' size differences mark then, but here it's clear from almost
the beginning that how small Judy the Bunny is sets her apart from
everyone when she's in the city (and likewise how she is bigger than
those in the Rodent district, which is a part of Zootopia built for
little mice). So it's not hard to see why she is set apart, and yet the
movie is more about if you really DO try to make a difference yourself
and set yourself apart, you can change things. Maybe. Or you might be
looked at as a sly fox your whole life, or a slow sloth. How are you
perceived in the world? Though it has a couple of story problems (a story turn two thirds of
the way through, which is kind of crammed in to create conflict where
it could be handled much better as far as something that separates the
two main characters), it's probably my favorite of the recent run of
Disney Animated Films productions. And as heavy as I'm making this
movie sound it really isn't - it's bright and colorful and the
filmmakers have a terrific sense of a whole world that has been built;
they could've rested on just one part (the main metropolitan/granite
part of the city), but there's so many parts to it that it works for so
many possibilities (polar bears, panthers, wolves have their parts of
the city) that are seized.It's fresh, clever but also funny, with some excellent performances
(Goodwin and Bateman sure, but Elba, Slade and Simmons are very welcome
additions with their own personalities), plus it's a cop procedural,
and a very good one at that (with a few predictable parts, but it's
this kind of movie so I can let it pass).

The problem with this title , and this serves as a warning to parents ,
is that is nothing like the trailer ! I took both my grandchildren to
see it and regret it. Violence, scary Unnecessary scenes of deep
darkness and monsters! Only funny part is the sloths at the information
counters... They really wasted great pictures and technology on this
one. The title song with Shakira is wonderful.. But the balance is very
disappointing. I wish i had known of that before. Again ,one of those
cases where a trailer is so misleading!Please talk to people who have seen it to see if they agree.Would like
to know if other people share my opinion.

I mean sure, it is a good movie, it is surely a one time watch (or you
can wait for the DVD release as well, no pressure), but surely, it is
not the slickest, smartest movie this year as it is has been made out
to be in the other reviews.I liked the story better than the jokes. The sloth part garnered a few
chuckles in the theater but apart from that it seemed like a nice story
stitched together. I was actually expecting more laughs than just a
chuckle or two in the entire movie.Still, all points considered (including the latent prejudice
commentary) it isn't THAT great, but still gets a 7/10, which is still
solid in my books.

It is actually getting scary right now. Ever since the Renaissance,
they proved to make successful movies out of risky concepts. Movies
like FROZEN and INSIDE OUT have given themselves a big challenge, but
at the same time gives a wide array of ideas and depth and meaning,
proving that these simple kids movies can resonate the same way, if not
more, to adults. Now in ZOOTOPIA, the Mouse House have given themselves
their boldest endeavor to date: creating a world entirely inhabited
with anthropomorphic animals while also throwing jabs at an abundant
supply of social commentary. The result is a smarter, more insightful,
and even darker execution than we ever expect from Disney, while also
being as charming, creative and at times heartwarming. And I will be
damned that, even considering some missteps, this may not turn out to
be one of the best movies of the year.The story centers around a rabbit named Judy Hopps who wishes to be a
cop while being discouraged by the fact that they do not allow innocent
prey as cops. Despite this, she proves to be cunning and willing enough
to prove the world that she could save the world. She then earns her
badge and is deployed to Zootopia, a New York Esq city filled with
animals. Along her journey to rise above the ranks, she meets Nick
Wilde, a sneaky fox who makes a living causing trouble with a personal
scarring almost parallel to Hopps. While solving a case of a missing
otter, they both team up to find him, all while delving into a much
bleaker and more complex story that honestly needs to be seen rather
than further explained.As expected with a premise like this, this movie goes full-force in its
social allegory that resembles the world we live in today, an endeavor
almost too risky to contemplate. In their universe, the predators and
prey used to be on opposing sides until an act that makes them equal.
Unfortunately, the predators now face overwhelming prejudice from a
paranoid society, preventing them from shopping or being free from
ridicule. Seriously! And it is quite apparent in his back story that
Nick evidently lived his whole life with this.But that doesn't stop there. Without spoiling too much, a certain
moment that might just be yet another forced conflict to transition to
the third act, the movie then pulls out a wild card and turn this into
a bigger issue: inventing said third act where the movie commentates on
segregation, racial profiling, law enforcement with a compromised moral
code, corrupt politicians, dirty secrets, and even the issues on
mentally instability.WOW!Say what you want about Disney, they do NOT hold back on this. So much
of this conflict is almost too rampant in our real world to bare, even
for a kids movie. Thankfully, the movie knows its limits and keeps it
accessible to the attended younger audience. That may be the strongest
secret to this movie: It commentates on these issues while also tying
into a rather coherent story and not have it over dominate the
proceedings, thus making it preachy. And it all comes together in the
finale, hopefully promoting a better future of equality, kindness, and
everything else Martin Luther King preaches, thus benefiting itself
into somehow being a more potent wake-up call than the utterly preachy
and jumbled circle-jerk towards objectivism that was last years
TOMORROWLAND. Even not considering all that though, the movie is also bursting with
charisma and creativity that hovers. The movie brings extra detail into
the practicality of how these animals inhabit Zootopia, thus creating a
bunch of clever jokes as well. Hopps determined natured paired with
Wilde's sly, quip-talking nature seemed too played out in other
buddy-cop movies, but thankfully the script, however juvenile (it is a
Disney movie after all), is tight enough to breathe these tropes onto
its own. And yes it is worth noting that the voice acting from Idris
Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, etc. are all top-notch. There are a few missteps, though. It has been well-known that the new
Disney movies like to play around with certain tropes of their own
(FROZEN especially). Here they do quite a few of them, and some skews a
little too on-the-nose. (see the movie to know what I am talking
about). Even they do well with invoking some clever commentary with the
animals, one in particular plays on for too long and serves little more
than a DMV joke. The writing, however tight as usual, remains just
enough to grasp for kiddies but fairs a little too obvious for me. To
be fair, I expect that going into this movie, but I cannot shake
occasional exposition that repeats plot points I already know. Small gripes notwithstanding, ZOOTOPIA is quite simply a revelation! A
type of movie that turns the tired "buddy-buddy cop" story into
something more thought-provoking than this company would usually allow.
A movie that will both leave kids with their minds nourished and their
parents' eyes open, it is smart, charming, and inspired. Finally, 2016
has its first great movie!Rating: 8/10 (GREAT)

I really enjoyed Zootopia. The characterization and animation were
simply top notch, and it was blessed with an interesting story-line
that touched on many real life conundrums.But there was a number of amusing ironic counter messages that may slip
under the radar.The first group related to Judy Hopps in police training:She is put in the boxing ring with rhino. The amusing thing is that she
wins the bout only by completely defying the laws of physics. So anyone
with a feel for physics realizes that the message is the exact opposite
to intended, you can't win in real life. A more thoughtful approach
would have been that Judy simply uses her natural speed and agility to
avoid the rhino until it tires and cannot fight on (perhaps with some
playful taunting), ending in a draw.The second message is evident when Judy is climbing the ice wall. The
message is, "if you can't climb the ice wall yourself, do so on the
backs of your classmates". An ironic and perhaps realistic unintended
message.The third message is that unless you fit in to the expected
characteristics for a school or job, you need to be the top of the
class to succeed. There can be only on top of the class, so the odds
aren't good. The second group of counter messages relates to "staying in your place
like you are told":Judy saves pretty much saves the entire city from civil war, and her
thanks is to keep her position as a police officer. They even rubbed
her nose in it with the "parking duty" joke at the end. Perhaps that is
what Judy would want, but the message is "stay in your place" not
"anyone can be anything". The other counter message is "when the
downtrodden get into power that behave even worse than the
over-privileged". Perhaps this is even often true, but a
counter-message nonetheless. Those downtrodden should stay in their
place because they deserve it ;)

First, let me say that this film does NOT preach social justice or
feminism. This film is not an allegory for racism/sexism, but is
however applicable to them. It is not preachy, nor is it liberal
propaganda; far from it, and this is coming from a person who severely
dislikes such films. Now let's get to this film. Zootopia is, if you don't know, about a
rabbit named Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) who, despite her
parents' and peers' opinions, becomes the first ever rabbit police
officer in a city called Zootopia, where both predators and prey get
along. On her first day, she is assigned a Missing Animal case, and her
only lead is a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). Don't listen to the trailers and plot summaries that make this film
seem like a cute talking animal film. This movie is one of the most
darkest and mature animated films I have ever seen, and I have seen a
lot. Mentioned before, this film deals with sexism (though not as
much), drugs, trusting one another, bullying and believing in yourself
regardless of the odds, as well as it's biggest moral which is racial
profiling and prejudice. And it isn't lightly handled either; the
"species-sm" (as the director called it) in this film is heartbreaking.
A part of the movie was spoiled for me prior to the film, and yet said
scene still made my heart malfunction in sorrow. This film is very
timely-yet-timeless about how gray the topic of racism actually is in a
modern society. Even without making real-life connections, the movie is still amazingly
entertaining. The world of Zootopia looks beautiful. The animation in
this film is jaw-dropping, and the world is so well thought-out and
interesting. You almost get angry when the film doesn't let you enjoy
certain landscapes, and that's due to the film's very fast-paced plot
that for some reason still finds time in giving us sweet and humble
moments. Plus, the story is very well- done, you really feel invested
in what's happening with the characters and city, and it's almost like
you are experiencing the movie unfold at that moment; like everything
that is happening is happening right at that second.The characters of this movie are wonderful. It's supporting cast is
very nice, with Idris Elba as a clichÃ© Buffalo cop, J.K Simmons as
Mayor of Zootopia, and more. But the spotlight shines on the main
characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde. Their relationship stays
platonic, however they have better chemistry than most Disney couples.
Both of them have their own flaws, and Nick and Judy know this about
each other and accept it. They are by no means perfect, and that's why
they are so relatable. Plus, they speak as if they are adults. Their is
a scene where Judy calls Nick "very articulate for a fox" which is very
applicable and is surprisingly articulate for an animated film. They
speak to each other in a very mature way, which only helps make their
bond even more enjoyable to see. And who could forget the voice acting? Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason
Bateman give absolutely extraordinary performances in this film. I was
so shocked to see how they spoke to each other because the voices were
so genuine and in the moment. All the characters were great, but the
main two were simply amazing. This film has great messages about racism, racial profiling, and
prejudice. It captures it all in ways no animated film has ever done.
Top it off with great animation, story, and astonishing characters, and
you have a film that stands with the animated classics. I highly
recommend seeing this film, it is truly amazing.

It seems that Disney studios continues to partake in a civil war
between their two animation companies. Today Walt Disney Animation
studios' puts out another work entitled Zootopia, to attempt to add
another Oscar worthy film to their ranks. With all the hype and build
up, I looked forward to being entertained by another masterpiece from
their studio. Yet the question "Is it worth the trip to theater?" may
be ringing through your ears. So once again I'm going to give you my
input and help you decide the answer to that question. ThereforeÂ…let's
get to it. Like every Disney movie you can bet that the animation is excellent,
and Zootopia is no exception. The cast of anthropomorphized animals
fluidly moves about the screen in a human like manner as they live
their lives throughout the fictional city, capturing the grace and
dexterity of the homo sapiens they are modeled after. Even more
impressive is seeing our animals in the primal state, as their anatomy
is fully captured in spectacular detail. But animation is only one part of the magic of Zootopia. The design of
the world is amazing, a perfect blend of modernized civilization and
animal ecosystems. Zootpia's residential sections emphasize certain
architectural styles that personify the particular mood of the area
(e.g. Icy cold tundra as a front for the Mafia or the serene yet wild
energy of the jungle villas.) All these details were brilliantly
colored and shaded, bringing out the emotion of each scene, but still
maintaining the whimsical nature of a Disney film. While I didn't see
the movie in 3-D, I can certainly see this beautiful world being
further stunning. While the design of the movie is enough to pull you into the theater
let's talk about the story and comedy of the movie next. Disney always
has the quirky, unique ideas that manage to imprint on our minds and
make us fall in love with it. For Zootopia that main story is a mystery
centered on disappearing animals across the city. This mystery
established the suspense of the story, keeping me intrigued throughout
the tale as to how deep the "rabbit" hole went. The genius of the movie
though is bringing two other stories into the fold and integrating them
into the plot. These plots are character-developing moments that give
our characters depth to latch onto. Much of these themes are tied to
some big moral dilemmas that are very relevant today such as racism,
feminism, and duty. And just like many of their movies, Zootopia takes
at stab at teaching us how to properly handle these situations (shame
on you Disney for teaching us!). Regardless whether you learn something
or not, Zootopia is an emotionally deep tale that has many levels for
all ages to enjoy and perhaps make you tear up in the process. As for the comedy, Zootopia trades in the stupid for a more clever and
cute approach. Fans of the DMV will get plenty of witty jabs at some
modern trends that include obsession with phones, scamming the system,
and plenty of TV references for the media obsessed. Well-timed
one-liners and comedic delivery by our voice actors keeps the comedy
fun and fresh and had me (and a few other audience members) laughing
throughout the film. I didn't notice many kids laughing throughout the
movie, most likely due to the lack of the childish humor. Plus side,
less repeating of quotes and sounds during the movie. Negative side,
they might not be as interested in the movie. Regardless, I certainly
enjoyed the writers' wittiness in this film and the fun energy they
injected with their comedy without diverging from the theme of the
movie. Now lets hit the weaknesses of the film. One thing I was disappointed
with was how much of the movie I had seen from the trailers. Disney
showed a lot of the funny parts numerous times and felt their effects
had waned by then. In addition I felt some of the scenes were not as
well done as the trailers had built them up to be, and kind of
lackluster compared to the trailer counterparts (such as the naturalist
scene). These moments felt unnecessary and barely relevant to the plot
and could have been vamped up a bit. In addition I was hoping that the
plot twist was a little better executed instead of dropping big hints
to give it away. A few other minor complaints include: some overdone
comedic ploys and some preachy moments that had me rolling my eyes. Disney once again hits a home run with their animated films. The design
of alone is impressive, but the movie is incredibly fun, clever, and
has the energy you love. Sure it may not be a film that will keep your
kids squealing in laughter, but Zootopia brings many aspects to the
silver screen that I think all ages will love. I fully support going to
see this movie in theaters and hope you will enjoy the film as much as
I did. My scores for Zootopia are: Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5Movie Overall: 8.0

When I first heard about Zootopia (back when it was a 2D film) I was
both excited and nervous. The anthropomorphic animal idea has been done
before, but never has it been used incredibly well. Robin Hood has
animals, but the animals don't live in a world that is as interesting
as they are.However, Zootopia happily makes a creative world that is interesting
look at and explore (and fortunately, it does explore its world
extensively).The greatest element of this movie is the animals and how they are
personified. The Water Buffalo is big, massive, tough, and doesn't care
about people's issues. The fox (Nick) is sly, clever, and always trying
to escape. The rabbit (Judy), is fast, agile, and always ready to act.
This makes for some very lively characters and very fun to watch
characters. The animation in this movie is gorgeous and the use of
depth perception is really good. Almost every shot is beautiful. You
can tell a lot of work went into the look of this movie.The story itself is good and uses clever elements (and some social
commentary) about how a population full of predators and prey would
work. What issues would there be? What could go wrong? A lot of these
ideas are explored in this film and it sometimes can feel a little
heavy-handed, but for the most part all of the subtext works within the
film (though there are a couple of moments where it is blatantly aimed
at the audience).My main issue with the film is the final act and the villain. The
concept is neat, but the amount of time spent between the villain
revealing their-self and them being defeated is about 3 minutes. I know
it is supposed to be a mystery until the end, but it didn't seem like a
very big pay-off for all of the build-up.Some of the side-issues involve the drama between some of the
characters that feels a little forced just for the sake of drama.
Should there be some drama? Yeah, but it should be done in a more
logical manner.All in all, Zootopia is a very entertaining film from Disney and I'm
glad I saw it. The animation is great, the story is pretty solid, and
the characters support the movie and make it worth a watch even if you
don't like the story or some of the (mildly) preachy moments.

So I was in theaters and had the choice of watching this or "Gods of
Egypt". It really wasn't a hard decision, mainly because I was getting
tired of the overly CGI with live action spectacle. And because I
thoroughly enjoy most Walt Disney Animation Studios movies since 2007.
In this case, this film really beat my expectations. I really didn't
know much about this movie besides the facts that it revolves around
talking animals. Kind of like "Madagascar", except this film is much
better than "Madagacar" or "Ice Age" in my own opinion. This really
does touch base with today's ideology and philosophy with the right
tone. When it comes to the setting it takes place in a environment
where all the animals try to live in harmony while living there lives
like regular day to day human beings. Except they still have certain
animal attributes and characteristics because they are still animals.
And the main plot revolves around a bunny rabbit named Judy Hopps who
always dreamed of becoming a cop and playing a part in making the world
a better place. So she enters the police force and later teams up with
a fox named Nick Wild. Who is actually a bit of a con artist and a
hustler. The thing is Hopps is put down on the force for being a rabbit
and people don't really trust Nick Wild because he is a fox. So that
label just sticks with them and brings them down throughout the movie.
I however really liked the chemistry of these two characters, it was
cute and I enjoyed the banter between the two. Because of the clever
quirky and snappy dialogue. It's like hearing the dialogue for "500
Days of Summer" except it's aimed for the whole family. So yeah, the
interaction and chemistry between the two leads is actually better than
some adult films out there because it's so well written. I really
didn't expect this movie to be a buddy cop movie, which either is a hit
or a miss and I will say this is a big hit. Anyways they are both put
in a situation where they try to solve a kidnapping case that goes
deeper and deeper as the story progresses. Like I said the chemistry
between the main two leads is fantastic. One is a super idealist and
the other is a skeptic, one has the heart and a good mindset while the
other has the street smart but they are both clever in there own way.
This film really resonated with me and the endearing moments actually
got to me. I just didn't expect this film to be all that deep until I
saw it. In fact I think this film will resonate more with adults than
kids. Mainly because of certain jokes, references such as modern
culture and mindset, certain messages and etc. Which will just blow
right past most kid audiences. And I really liked the messages in this
movie, it's something I put a lot of thought of in the past and
something I could resonate with. It's something that I think everyone
should apply in there lives instead of acting like a heard of sheeps.
But whatever floats each others boat. However I do think this film will
boost furry fandom to another level. I really can't see any flaws with
this film except maybe the pacing is slightly slow at times, but I
don't even think that should even be a gripe. It's just me probably
being picky. The build up is good and I actually cared about the
characters and the situations. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this film
and I would highly recommend it. Some may say this movie is a bit too idealistic. But I just recently
finished the 5th season of "Game of Thrones" which basically deals with
constant skepticism, assumptions, hubris ramblings and betrayal. That
there is a motive for EVERYTHING! So this film was refreshing to me,
mainly because it balances out the idealistic thoughts and rationality.
That sometimes following your heart might not be enough to lead to the
right destination. And that a balance of both is needed sometimes,
which I agree with.10/10

When I first saw trailers for Zootopia, I didn't think the movie would
be super amazing. I thought it would at least be decent. Most of
Disney's animal movies fall under being good, but nothing too
substantial. However, after watching Zootopia, I was proved wrong. Very
wrong. So wrong, in fact, that I didn't even feel like I was watching a
Disney movie.This is where the spoilers start to appear, so you've been warned. Zootopia has a lot of.....adult themes. Nothing too inappropriate, like
sex or murder, but there are a surprising amount of rather serious
issues such as racism, bullying, a little bit of violence (I believe
they show a bit of blood a couple times), very subtle drug trading
references, and they say "Oh my God" instead of "Oh my gosh". These
things are why I felt like I wasn't watching a Disney film. It was
pretty ballsy of them to include such things into their story. But
y'know what? It all works. Racism plays a huge part in this film. It
not only affected Judy Hopps' dream of wanting to be a cop, but Nick
Wilde as well. His back story was rather tragic, and I actually was on
the verge of crying when watching. I won't give away what happens to
him in his past, but it's pretty dark, and pretty upsetting. I think
it's up there with Bambi's mom getting shot.These themes, while smartly written, I think confused the younger
audience. I heard one little boy complain about not wanting to watch
the movie anymore, and that he wanted to go home. The other kids,
though, asked occasional questions, and laughed when they were supposed
to. So, I don't think your kids will be terribly confused, but many of
the references they bring up, and some scenes of the movie may confuse
them a bit. I would like to say that they won't be bored, but they may
end up being bored with a few scenes mainly because they won't
understand. Oh, and there are a few jump scares. They should be
prepared for those as well.The characters are really fun to watch. I don't think I disliked
anyone. Judy Hopps is a wonderful female protagonist who, while she is
small, has a large heart. She's a dreamer who will go the distance to
get what she wants. She's truly a likable character, and I love her.
She's also the most adorable rabbit ever. Nick Wilde is a sly, cunning
fox. He may start off as sarcastic and a bit rude, but trust me when I
say that you'll grow to like him, especially because of his back story.
There's more to him than you think. The side characters each have their
charm, like Clawhauser, who's an adorable geek with a huge crush on a
singer. Flash's name is very deceiving, since he is not fast at all.
He's hilarious to watch, though. Bogo appears to be a tough,
unsympathetic jerk in the beginning, but toward the end, we see him
slowly change into a more likable character. The list goes on.I definitely would not say this is just a kids' film. I'm not even sure
if young kids can appreciate it. I definitely would recommend this to
maybe preteens and older. Adults will certainly get a kick out of most
of the jokes, and appreciate the story more. Younger kids may
appreciate the cute animals and few funny scenes, but the story may
leave them puzzled or bore them. If you have young kids, and want to
take them to see Zootopia, go ahead. It's a great family film, but just
keep in mind that your kids may end up being a bit confused. As for
adults, I definitely recommend it for any who are Disney/animation
fans, or who like crime solving films. I promise you it won't
disappoint. :)

Note: While I do not give away the mystery of the film, I discuss some
character dynamics that may be surprising to viewers.I deleted my original review of Zootopia because I recently watched it
again. My original impressions were inverted, yet I still loved the
film the same. I originally thought that this film was gritty and bleak
with mean-spirited satire that righteously skewers social norms. I even
thought of Silence of the Lambs, because the protagonist is a rural
woman (or doe bunny) who joins law enforcement and has to solve a
missing persons (or mammal) case.Yet when I watched it again, I was uplifted. The bad parts weren't so
bad, and I even softened on my original impression that young children
shouldn't watch this movie. Yes, there are frightening images, but if a
child of any age is prepared, this is essential viewing.The plot involves Judy Hopps, who comes to Zootopia as a rookie cop: In
fact, she is the first bunny cop in a force made of megafauna and
predators. Because of this, the police chief assigns her exclusively to
parking duty, which disappoints Hopps immensely. While on the beat, she
spots a fox that she profiles and stalks. This fox, Nick Wilde, manages
to con her, but he turns out to be a useful lead in a missing otter
case. Complicating matters is that Judy must solve the case in 48 hours
or resign her new job.That sounds like heavy adult stuff, and it is. The characters in this
story have adult desires and address each other as adults and use
refined adult vocabulary to communicate to each other. The entry point
for child viewers is that we see Judy and Nick as children, and the
experiences that made them into the adults they are. If children see
this movie now, they will see that growing up is just taking the
experiences you've accumulated and applying them today.But yes, this film is hilarious. There are distinct skit-like segments
that tie the mystery together, and while you are laughing, the plot is
moving. And while the plot is moving, the film reveals the uglier and
painful parts of Judy and Nick's lives. Later in the film, it turns out
that Judy isn't as tolerant and enlightened as she thinks, and she
greatly offends Nick, who justifiably walks out from their partnership.When I first saw this film, I was convinced that Nick and Judy were
like brother and sister. Now I feel that what they share in this movie
is so intimate and moving that they could reasonably be a romantic
couple. Still, they are not lovebirds: They are deeply sarcastic and
insightful mammals who delight in each other's company.I suppose this film is like like itself: The more you experience, the
more your perspective changes.

Disney strikes again with a simply astonishing movie. To start off, I
would recommend ANYONE to go watch this movie. This is a movie for
anyone of any age.The city of Zootropolis is a busy metropolis with animals instead of
humans running the city. Deep beneath its shiny surface, it doesn't
turn out to be as glamorous as it leaves the first impression.The story focuses on two characters, Nick and Judy, a fox and a rabbit.
The unlikely pair work together to solve the disappearance of 14
citizens of Zootropolis. During their adventures, we learn of Judy's
and Nick's background and where they come from to where they are today. The movie is graphically most certainly impressive and the audio is
simply a treat to the ears. Especially with Shakira's song cover. It's
a simply fantastic movie, filled with humor that would make anyone
laugh. And there are heart warming moments too that really make you
fall in love with the characters who the story evolves around.

"Zootopia" is Disney's 55th full length animated feature. it is
directed by Rich Moore, and Byron Howard. it stars Ginnifer Goodwin and
Jason Bateman as a bunny named Judy Hopps, and a fast talking scam
artist fox named Nick Wilde. the film takes place in an animated world where predator and prey live
together in peace and harmony in a city known as Zootopia. Judy Hopps
(played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is the first bunny officer in the Zootopia
police department or ZPD. when an otter goes missing she has to team up
with a fast talking scam artist fox named Nick Wilde (played by Jason
Bateman) who is a key witness to the crime, in order to solve the case.I'm gonna tell you right off the bat that this movie is Flawless. it is
an amazing movie with great characters, a great story, great writing,
great jokes, and great animation. it even has lessons about prejudice,
racism, and the judgment of other people based on what they are or what
they look like. it covers every problem facing our world today and the
way the filmmakers did it is perfect, but I'll talk more about that
later.The characters are amazing and the way they work off each other is
amazingly well done. Judy Hopps is a great female character, as well as
Nick Wilde who is a great male character and the way they work off each
other is fantastic. Their back stories very well tie in with their
character and how they operate in this world from the past to the
present. the other side characters are great and have a purpose to be
in the story. there is a villain reveal in this movie, and I am not
telling you who the villain is because that would be a spoiler but
he/she is a great villain with a great diabolical plan. The story is
very original and to recall, I don't think Disney has ever done a story
relating to prejudice and racism before in their animated features,
which is a tough subject to successfully pull off, and they did it very
well here. it touched on every subject to seriously talk about that's
happening to this world.The Animation is very well detailed, rendered, and animated and the
designs don't feel out of place in the world that they live in. it's
amazing to watch and beautiful to look at and easy to identify
characters with their design. The soundtrack is very well composed as
it is written by Michael Giacchino who composed other Disney works like
the incredibles and ratatouille. to end off on a high note this movie is one of Disney's perfect
animated films that succeeds in every level of creativity. 10/10-5
stars out of 5 Disney's best animated film.

Disney has a long history of talking animal movies, and with their
latest animated movie, Zootopia, they manage to go beyond the usual
trappings of almost every other talking animal movie to make the
strongest movie Disney Animation has put out since the Nineties. Now I
know that's a bold claim, considering in just the past three to four
years alone we've had the likes of Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero
6, but there is something special about Zootopia that makes it such a
strong entry in the Disney canon.The titular Zootopia is an animal metropolis in a world where all
animals have evolved to become anthropomorphic beings who dress, act,
and live like the humans of our world. Our heroine is Judy Hopps, the
first rabbit cop Zootopia has ever seen. Judy is belittled by her
superiors and only has 48 hours to prove herself by solving a missing
animals case or else she'll have to turn in her badge. With the help of
a con artist fox named Nick Wilde, Judy just might be able to do just
that. What follows is a story that is as warm and fuzzy as anything
that Disney has ever done, but with more shades of our real world sewn
thematically throughout the narrative.The whole of Zootopia is about the concept of prejudice against others,
or more particularly, our stereotyping people and wanting to put them
in a box, saying they cannot go beyond those limitations. We see that
everyday in our real world and it's heady stuff for an animated Disney
movie, which is why it is great that the movie is as funny as it is.
Seriously, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while,
animated or live action, which allows the larger ideas at work in the
story to never feel preachy. The greatest feat of this movie is how
gracefully it skirts around its real meaning without feeling as if the
movie makers are pushing their own personal agendas. The movie is made
in such a way that moviegoers can graft their own experiences onto
these characters because we've all felt the ways that these characters
have felt at one point or another -- bullied, underestimated, and
misunderstood. In doing this, Zootopia becomes something special, that
rare breed of movie that makes you think, feel, and have fun, all in
equal measure, with a lot of the fun part coming thanks to the sheer
originality at every turn.Zootopia is one of the most original movies Disney has made in a long
while, with the city of Zootopia being such a unique creation. All of
the different ecosystems in Zootopia are a joy to see, from a
rainforest area, to a tundra area, all the way to Little Rodentia,
where the mice live in miniaturized skyscrapers, the animators, led by
directors Byron Howard and Rich Moore, really capture the essence of
both city life and the animal kingdom, in a perfect design meld. Then
there are the countless jokes that play off of all the unique traits
that each animal species is known for, such as bunnies being good at
multiplication or there being only sloths working at the DMV. You can't
help but laugh and be amazed at every turn at how nimbly the movie
keeps clipping along. Then there's the fact that Zootopia is also a
mystery yarn, with the movie often mimicking old detective flicks in
the way that Judy and Nick try to solve their case, adding elements of
suspense to an otherwise traditional animated movie.So if you can't tell, I loved Zootopia and thought it was a real joy
from start to finish. From top to bottom, this is just a well made
movie, featuring exceptional writing, directing, voice acting,
animation, and music, with Michael Giacchino's musical score infusing
lots of tribal African instrumentation to create a score that is
different and engaging. While the movie is a little rougher than most
parents might expect, due to some frightening moments involving bullies
and some rabid animals, kids about seven and up should have a blast
with it. I know this big kid did.I give Zootopia a 10 out of 10!

2016 has been a so-so year in film thus far. Sure, it's only the
beginning of March, but there hasn't really been that knock out film to
this point. I enjoyed The Finest Hours and Eddie the Eagle for what
they were, but besides perhaps Deadpool, no movie has really been worth
seeing more than once. Zootopia absolutely is that film for me. It's
the next installment in Disney Animation Studio's resurgence of
greatness and it can be enjoyed by everyone. It may be Disney's most
colorful film to date, for a few reasons, but it also has the classic
Disney moral message for viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Zootopia takes place in a world where there are no humans and animals
do everything as if they are humans. They have houses, police forces,
and access to our type of transportation. Basically, this is the one
film in Disney's canon where fans can't really make the theories that
it takes place within the same universe as all of the other films. With
that said, I loved the world building that Zootopia was able to
establish. In many ways, this is the film I can see Disney making
sequels to for several years to come. The characters are well realized
and there are plenty of potential directions they can take the story.Right from the opening scene I found myself attached the adorable, Judy
Hopps, a bunny who dreams of becoming the first of her species to
become a cop. Zootopia takes on many of the unfortunate tropes of our
real world but the one most identifiable is discrimination and
segregation. So of course Hopps is naturally not taken seriously as a
determined officer of the law. The self-referential nature of the film
doesn't stop there but I don't think it ever jumps the shark. As
noticeable as some of the discrimination and prejudices can be when
pointed out by several characters, it ends of serving as a good message
to not judge or underestimate people's determinations and dreams.On the lighter side, Zootopia is one of the cleverest Disney films to
come out in recent memory. Its constant nods to pop culture including
famous films like The Godfather or TV shows like Breaking Bad give the
parents more than enough reason to take their kids to the theater.
There are plenty of jokes that will fly over kids heads and the humor
never gets too silly. It's a great balance that makes an animated kids
films so great, and Zootopia is a good example of that.More than anything, it's worth seeing for its fun characters and
inspiring message. The voice talent is as good as it has been for
Disney in a long time as Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, Idris Elba,
Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons all do a wonderful job bringing these
characters to life. You will get attached to Hopps and her unlikely fox
friend, Nick Wilde as they go on a journey to uncover a conspiracy that
is plaguing Zootopia. Which brings up another brilliant aspect of this
film which is its meticulous plot. Near the end some moments felt
contrived and perhaps too far-fetched, but when you have enjoyed a film
to the extent to which I had enjoyed Zootopia to that point, it didn't
really bother me.When an animated Disney film manages to bring to life several new and
exciting characters while also implanting an intricate crime story in
between, you know you have a gem on your hands. Zootopia may not be as
memorable as some of the greatest Pixar films (hey what films are?) but
it does have its fair share of thought provoking moments and endlessly
re-watchable funny gags. A clever script and a thought provoking
message makes Zootopia the best 2016 film to date thus far.+Voice cast+Well-realized world+Something for everyone+Likeable characters you can't help but root for+Pop culture references+Thought provoking message-Some moments felt contrived towards the end9.4/10

Well, the trailers did make it seem assembly line like. Surprise,
surprise: this one's got heart, and brains, to boot...And it does help
that its themes are as timely and topical as the ones espoused in the
Pixar master-work, 'Wall-E'.Watched this one on(L)I(e)max 3D. Good projection, decent seating, 3D
experience worth the surcharge. I think the predominant theme underlying the entire take is the
prevalence of prejudices, preconceived notions, and how characters with
heart (read, courage) can overcome those and see the truth lying
beneath, whether/not they want to see it. Now, though I'm gonna point out my disappointment with the flick, I
feel the intent deserves points on its own (which its sure raking up at
the box office). Gotta make that reference once again here - this one's
almost as ambitious as the masterful 'Wall-E', albeit more in terms of
intent rather than content. If only....Now, this movie does many things right, in terms of putting us in the
middle of an unfolding tale of an ambitious underdog- type (typical
mainstream movie trope, disappointingly so, imho), who, for all intents
and purposes, is our window into this alternate universe where humans
don't figure (an interesting question actually..are we extinct in
'Zootopia'?). To me, answering that question would have made for a far
more interesting movie, but that's a separate topic.Now, most of the entire movie is curiously framed as a buddy cop
mystery scenario (another trope used both in mainstream cinema and in
Indies, perhaps to better effect in the latter), & that might put a few
people off, especially those who've seen this scenario better explored
in superior movies ('Kiss kiss bang bang' comes to mind, and 'Lethal
Weapon' while it was still fresh - both having Shane Black in common),
who've been expecting something different here. The voice-work by named actors is pretty good, and Jason Bateman proves
that he pretty much owns anything he's in, even if he's given cheesy
lines for an endearing character, but one who's bogged down by utter
predictability.But, for me, the lack of anything substantial, and the main plot just
taking off a few minutes before it's curtains was the most
disappointing thing of all, in addition to, payoffs bring undeserved as
well as underserved, along with comeuppances being unearned too (my
comparisons? Most Pixar works using the Lasseter name, including the
reviled 'Brave'). The McGuffin used, I'd perhaps one of the weakest
ever.The movie also goes fully bland mainstream in the selection of its
color palette, 3d and musical score choices. To me, that smacked of
studio interference at many junctures. Even the mainstream trope
thrills don't really pump adrenaline that most Pixar works are known to
(Finding Nemo, Incredibles, the aforementioned Wall-E, the inferior
Cars and Brave......). To me, the condition and execution of the action set- pieces was
borderline bland, as was the villain and the motivation, and the
supremely disappointing/underwhelming denouement.Keeping all the negatives listed above in perspective, I find it
curious that this one's getting a heavy push from RT etc. though it's
not in Pixar league, in spite of some pedigree.Also, this one gets a day-date release here, while the (apparently)
superior Kung fu Panda 3 might make it's easy here only after a month?
Something's not right.Could have been really great. A huge missed opportunity, imho.

Anyone thinking that the creators had the issues of present in mind
doesn't really understand what is involved in the process of making
animated movies. That said, this movie does include a great message of
prejudices and not only how one can be affected by them externally but
how even the most well-meaning of people can be prejudiced. This is all
done without being heavy handed or preachy. The story is a great buddy
movie with crime thriller/neo-noir inspiration. The animation is
vibrant, creative, and detailed and the world building that goes into
the movie is just fantastic. My only nitpick is that I do wish we got
to spend a little more time in the districts and get a look at the
different environments surrounding Zootopia. The humor is great and
never devolves into lowest common denominator.I will say this is a well earned PG. There are some tough scenes
(including that of bullying) and a couple of intense/scary action
scenes. Overall, Zootopia is a movie that adults & kids alike can
enjoy.

(RATING: â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†Â½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A delightfully zany animated jaunt through the detective
genre with our four-legged animal friends.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: In this world, all animals coexist in perfect harmony and
take on stereotypical human traits. This animated buddy cop film
introduces an idealistic rookie bunny teaming up with a cynical fox to
investigate a series of attacks.JIM'S REVIEW: The evils of prejudice and the need for diversity are the
underlying themes in Disney's Zootopia. We view a pastel-colored utopia
sans humans where animals are "10% predator, 90% prey". That is until
some violence upsets the natural order of things. Which brings Officer
Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman)
together to solve this whodunit.The film spoofs film noir, detective stories, The Godfather, Breaking
Bad, cop films, and other pop references as the duo go about following
leads while not-too-subtly handling the message of tolerance and
equality. The puns are plentiful in Jared Bush and Phil Johnson's funny
screenplay which contrasts this crazy metropolis with our real world.
The script uses animal profiling to the nth degree in a most seductive
and insightful way which brings about much of the comedy elements.A committee of directors are credited with this film (Bryon Howard,
Rich Moore, and, once again, Mr. Bush), so their individual
contributions are not readily known, but their end result is seamlessly
blended to create a wonderful children's film that seems more skewed
for the adults in the audience. The animation is highly detailed and beautifully rendered, creating a
satirical universe. The visuals work in unison with a strong narrative,
so rare in today's animation which usually panders to sophomoric humor
and bad story-telling. Although the filmmakers lay their overly
positive message on too thickly and their politics is biased to the
obvious liberal left (of which, I firmly concur), this does not
interfere with one's full enjoyment of the film's overall wholesomeness
and "kumbaya" positive vibe.Ms. Goodwin and Mr. Bateman bring such joy and credibility to their
characters. Providing expert voice-overs as well are Idris Elba, J.K.
Simmons, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong (superb as a holistic yak named Yax),
Nate Torrance, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Shakira, Octavia Spencer, Alan
Tudyk, and Raymond S. Persi as Flash, the slowest sloth clerk at the
Department of Motor Vehicles, whose short (and long) bit is the film's
laugh-out-loud highlight.Zootopia is the type of film whose main purpose to to entertain and
amuse. Yet, it doesn't shy away from some serious issues. This animated
film is not afraid to talk about the elephant in the room, even when
there is an actual pachyderm in close proximity, which makes it all the
more charming and memorable family fare.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com

When one thinks of animation, walking and talking animals come to mind.
Even at the start of animation, characters like Mickey Mouse and Felix
the Cat were human-like animals that were the stars of the genre as
they could speak to everyone and still be as entertaining as any human.
Warner Brothers has the Looney Tunes, which is full of anthropomorphic
animal-characters that perform vaudeville routines like a regular human
comedian. MGM has Tom and Jerry, the ultimate battle to the death as a
cat and mouse should, yet still make their slapstick comedy relatable
enough for people to connect with. Now Disney has an interesting note
with walking, talking animals.Despite having a mascot that's anthropomorphic, Disney haven't made
much content with human- like animals. 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the
Tramp and The Jungle Book has such creatures, but live in a world full
of people that are the dominant species. In the case of an entire world
of animals, I can only think of Robin Hood (which I really like) and
Chicken Little (which I consider one of Disney's worst) that have
pulled that off. Zootopia takes that same idea, but really takes
advantage of the environment it creates to create something really
unique.Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny who has always
wanted to be a cop. She's constantly told by everyone, even her
parents, that bunnies cannot be police officers due to their size and
cute look. She proves them wrong and passes the police academy first in
her class and a position in the metropolis of Zootopia. Though promised
that she would receive the same treatment like her fellow officers, her
police captain Chief Bogo (played by Idris Elba) assigns her parking
duty. Rather then complain, she takes her new assignment with
excitement, hoping her work effort will lead to something better. After arresting a thieving weasel, she given a chance to find a missing
otter within forty-eight hours or risk having to resign. The only clue
she has is a photo from where Emmet Otterton was last seen. She finds a
clue that leads her to a sly, con artist fox Nick Wilde (played by
Jason Bateman). Though she has a prejudice against foxes (due to her
past), they team up to find the otter. Their various clues take them to
a nudist club run by a Yak (played by Tommy Chong), a DMV run by
sloths, and even a crime boss shrew named Mr. Big in order to discover
the bigger mystery within the city.When I heard about Zootopia, I wasn't sure if more could be offered to
the anthropomorphic animal setting. I was not only proved wrong, but
this blew me away. The folks at Disney should be city designers as
Zootopia feels like a legitimate city with it's various sections. From
the desert to the tundra and even a section for rodents, the city could
rank up with Los Angeles in Blade Runner or Gotham in Batman. I'll be
surprised if something from this movie is not incorporated into the
Disney Parks.The voice acting is simply perfect with Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason
Bateman as a good set of buddies in this cop story. Speaking of
mysteries, the case to be solved was very intriguing and manages to
pull off a moral that's perfect with the recent news stories of racism
and gender discrimination. I assume that Disney had wanted to tell a
story on racism and prejudice for a while and Zootopia should get the
adults to think while keeping the children entertained with some great
slapstick that remains fast and essential to the plot.I'll give this ten Nick Wildes out of ten. While Frozen may have been
the major Disney movie that people wouldn't stop talking about,
Zootopia has a chance to divert that attention as it already has for
me. I highly recommend this for everyone, especially for adults, even
if they claim they don't like animation.

Wow, this one surprised me. I saw the early trailers for this movie and
had extremely low expectations for this movie, expecting to just be
another awful March movie. However, when I saw that it then had a 98%
on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to go see it. Well, I was wrong to judge
it so early just based on the trailer. This movie was absolutely
brilliant. It had more to say on relevant issues than a vast majority
of adult live-action movies do, and it still found a way to do so in a
clever and not overbearing way. The plot, while formulaic, was still
interesting and the message and humor more than made up for the
relative unoriginality of the plot. The characters in this movie were
also rather clichÃ©, but the movie used that nicely to make many points
about stereotyping so that can't be used as a negative. This is a
must-see for both kids and adults, the best true "family" movie in
years.

Walt Disney Animation Studios, in the decade from 1989 to 1999,
produced some of the Western world's most cherished and culturally
significant films: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin,
the Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan. Not only were these films
artistic masterpieces, but they in many ways captured the zeitgeist of
their era - the "Disney Renaissance".Following a tumultuous transition to computer animation, since the
release of Tangled in 2010, we are currently amidst Disney's triumphant
return to form as an animation studio peerless in its technical
animation and narrative prowess. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and
now Zootopia, all demonstrate the studio's remarkable ability to
combine spectacular visual pieces of art with storytelling that both
inform and are informed by the cultural dialogue of the time.Frozen proved to be a cultural phenomenon for this reason, and
deservedly so. Yet with Zootopia, Disney has surpassed anything it has
previously produced during this new post-Tangled "Golden Era" - its
computer animation has never been so breathtaking, its writing has
never been so on point, and its messaging has never been so timely.In terms of its artistic wizardry, Zootopia surpasses the high bars set
by Disney's previous work Big Hero 6 and Dreamworks's How to Train Your
Dragon 2. The environments are rendered with such sumptuous detail and
inspired creativity that, counter-intuitively, one almost forgets
you're watching a computer animated film. The movie does not strive
towards photo-realism - the aesthetic is definitely stylized - and yet
many scenes exude so much detail that they almost become photo
realistic. The introductory tour through the city of Zootopia, as the
camera speeds through its various biomes, is a marvel of animation and
world-building. Combined with the smart and often surprisingly mature
dialogue, Zootopia very may well be a brilliant live-action cop
mystery/drama.The dynamic detective duo of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde serves as the
narrative anchor and emotional core of the film. Voiced perfectly by
Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman respectively, the chemistry between
the two supplies their friendly relationship with much of its emotional
weight and attractiveness. Dialogue throughout the film is clever and
often uproariously funny, easily sustaining interest in the movie's
story.On these grounds alone, Zootopia would be an excellent entry into
Disney's repertoire. The film's underlying message, however, propels it
to even greater heights. Animated movies are no strangers to
anthropomorphic animals, but Zootopia leverages this device to its full
potential and asks the viewer to consider important questions about
race relations, prejudice, and stereotyping without his or her real
world preconceptions and associated baggage. Released in the first
quarter of 2016, this discussion could not be more important given
given the politics and current affairs of both the United States and
Europe.The easy course for this discussion would have been to follow the
struggles of a minority group within Zootopia's inhabitants, which then
would map onto a real world disadvantaged group and the challenges they
face. In a real show of ingenuity in creative writing, Zootopia avoids
this simplistic path completely. There is no clear-cut oppressor and
oppressed, no abuser and victim, no privileged and disadvantaged.
Instead, the movie wants us to think about the core challenges
presented by prejudice and discrimination on their own terms within a
world where, much like ours, such distinctions between groups often can
be highly fluid and contextual.The predators of Zootopia struggle to escape their prehistorical roots
as the oppressing class of species in a universe where the animal
kingdom has biologically evolved far beyond this - appeals to "biology"
in favour of the dominance of predators are just as flawed as their
real-world racial parallels. Yet simultaneously, predators are also a
minority within Zootopia, and are shown to be equally capable of being
the victims of prejudice, stereotyping, media sensationalism, and
dog-whistle politics. Zootopia shows just how complex, messy, and
intractable these conflicts are. Things simply cannot be distilled down
to, "Here's the dominant group, here's the group that they're
discriminating against. Look how awful it is..." With this sharp
commentary, Zootopia is the product of Disney firing on all cylinders.
If there was still doubt as to whether we indeed are in the midst of a
resurgent Golden Era for the studio, this film firmly quashes it.

Zootopia is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, and Jared Bush, and
stars Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, a bunny rabbit that lives in a
world in which animals are civilized, and live in cities together. She
dreams of being a police officer in a big city called Zootopia, even
though all of her peers, including her parents, try to keep her under
the "status quo," in which she is just a simple carrot farmer. She
disagrees with this, and becomes a police officer, yet realizes that
she was handed a case bigger than she could imagine; a case she must
solve with the help of a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).To begin, Zootopia is hands down the best Disney film since The Lion
King (1994). Everything about this movie was utterly amazing, and
surprised me in so many ways. The underlying tone and themes, the
characters, the plot, the voice acting, and the animation. First, the
primary themes in the film are actually very dark and deep. There's
symbolism of racism, sexism, drugs, and even what American is supposed
to stand for, yet fails at doing. All of these themes play across
perfectly, and are very surprising in a children's movie.The characters and plot in this film are both equally perfect. The plot
shows that anybody can be anything, and the characters describe this so
very well. All of the characters are very interesting, and
three-dimensional in ways that are subtle, yet obvious once the film
all come together. Each character has a great arc throughout the movie,
and learns a lesson through experiences and other characters they meet.The voice acting is this film is rare. I mean this by saying the the
voice acting is absolutely perfect. There isn't a single flaw with the
acting, and each actor portrays their character amazingly. Jason
Bateman as Nick Wilde was a perfect casting choice, although it didn't
seem that way prior to viewing the film. Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps
was also amazing, and brought the character to life in such a way that
is near impossible for an animated movie. Idris Elba as Police Chief
Bobo is also fantastic. He depicts a hardened police officer is a way I
never would have thought of. Even Shakira does really good in this
movie, which is something I never thought I would say.The animation in Zootopia is also top notch. Every tiny, seemingly
insignificant movement, by any and every character, flows flawlessly
with the background, and looks absolutely perfect. All of the animation
is ultimately impeccable.Overall, Zootopia is an amazing film that children will love seeing,
along with their parents or older siblings. It will easily be known as
a Disney classic in 20 years or so, due to the animation, characters,
acting, and intense plot. Zootopia deserves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.

Ever since the turn of the 2010s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has
been skyrocketing than ever before with great momentum. From an
aspiring restaurateur who became a frog, a princess with long magical
hair, a bad guy wanting to be good, a tale of two sisters, and even a
troubled boy with his inflatable robot companion. For their latest
flick called Zootopia, it's an intriguing caper comedy that not only
spoofs the buddy-cop detective formula or noir like in 1988's Who
Framed Roger Rabbit, but also tackles the themes that exist in PC
(politically correct) culture. In this day and age, political
correctness has been ongoing with the media exploiting the
misunderstandings and atrocities happening in current events such as
injustice and discrimination. Thinking back on the old 1946 Disney film
Song of the South featuring characters Br'er Fox and Br'er Rabbit,
that's where PC is finally drawn into this movie's characters and
"species-ism" is tested.Jason Bateman (Horrible Bosses, Paul) voices con artist, street smart
fox Nick Wilde as he makes a living in the animal-inhabited metropolis
hustling various individuals. At the same time rural rabbit Judy Hopps
(voiced by Once Upon A Time's Ginnifer Goodwin) has just arrived in the
big city to begin her first day as the first rabbit officer. Although
swift, skilled, and able to hold out on her own, fellow officers don't
exactly see her capable of reaching their ranks. It's up to both
natural enemies to work together when a crime is committed in the
seemingly blissful Zootopia, while at the same time learning that
they're not so different from each other.I have to say that in the studio's current Revival Era, the animators
have really stepped it up a notch by exploring a PC-coated world
completely devoid of all humans and where anthropomorphic animals
dominate compared to childhood Disney classics I remembered in the 90s.
I'm aware that this "human-less" concept has been done before for many
decades during Walt Disney's lifetime and even after his passing, but
it looks like nearly everything actually stands out from spoofed
product placements to the current trends of music, technology, fashion,
and lifestyle. Disney's 1973 movie Robin Hood helped open that door
when adding animals in place of the usual human characters, but this
time more attention to detail from the largest to the tiniest in the
architectural designs looking like a cross between Times Square and
Dubai (heck, even a hint ofÂ… San Fransokyo). And then there's its
inhabitants; they are what makes this entire movie look appealing,
inviting, relatable, and immersive. Gazelle's (Shakira) song "Try
Everything" was also pretty entrancing to my ears. Disney easter eggs
are also pleasing to keep a look out for (try finding some!)To conclude, although the movie does slightly ride off its rails in
some scenes involving the lack of exploring further into the other
regions that connect to the big city and a concept of an individual who
is ostracized based on who they are or what they look like is vaguely
similar to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph; it recovers with a thoughtful moral
about the big city with real-life social issues and stereotypes being
overwhelming and even troubling sometimes. But it's really about
finding your true potential and not letting naysayers get the better of
you. This isn't just some kids' movie, there's thematic material adults
may relate to as well. I can already predict Oscar nods awaiting, too.
Go see it and find out for yourself.

Zootopia is a Disney movie so it goes without saying that it will be
BEAUTIFUL! But it's something else as well, this is a smart movie with
clever writing and some very adult jokes sneaked in there but it'll
take you a second to get them. ExampleThe bunny is doing some math to calculate taxes, in the middle of of
the equation she says "and because bunnies are good at multiplying we
carry the four and ....etc" I laughed at the joke but it went by so fast that my group missed it
and it took them a minute to get it.Is this a good movie? Yes, yes it is... but.... the message is hammed
in and it's such a basic message that even a child knows. Racism is
bad, don't judge people on racial stereotypes. It's a good message and
the movie does deliver it in a clever way, but it could have been
better, the children in the theater were getting bored and antsy mid
way through which is never a good sign for a movie aimed at kids
(marketing wise)To me this felt more like a movie aimed at adults but because of the
Disney name had to wear kid friendly camouflage.Give it a go but expect to like it more then your kids will.

Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed
this tale of a female rabbit wanting to became a cop and then growing
up and becoming one in the title city. She's the first of her species
to became one as other kinds of animals have been one before her but
not a fox, though initially one isn't one yet here either. The fox she
encounters in Zootopia is in fact someone different than what she's
been familiar with before but I'm ahead of myself. I'll just now say
that this was quite a funny and inspirational Disney computer-animated
movie with a nice message of anyone can be what they want to be if they
work hard enough to reach that goal. So on that note, I highly
recommend Zootopia.

The laugh from the theater,the great storyline and details,the
insinuate of human society,also it's cute...everything proves how
wonderful the movie is. I think the movie showed us the process of
making dreams come true and some treasured spirit such as brave,unite
together, justice;it also tell us the story about
friendship(love)between nick and Judy (which touched me when Judy found
the flowers and apologize to nick). In the other hand,this movie is
full of laugh line,it made the movie interesting,it also made the
character both lively and cute which can be more attractive foe female
viewer. After all,I think this is the best movie that Disney had after
2010s, and it's even better than INSIDE OUT last year.I believe that
ZOOTOPIA can be a part of next year's Oscar prize.

I was pretty skeptical about this movie before going into the theater,
I'd assumed that it was going to be like a slightly better chicken
little, so I had my expectations lowered quite a bit before watching
this. But dang, this film surprised me, it was amazing! The dialogue,
animation, music, humor, everything! Not only that but I can guarantee
that adults will enjoy this film instead of just sitting in the theater
stuffing popcorn into their mouths. This movie comes with a great
message about racism, prejudice, and gender stereotypes. Jason Bateman
was spectacular as Nick Wilde along with Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy
Hopps, and with Idris Elba as Chief Bogo. If you think your kid will
enjoy this movie, then you'll know you will too. TL;DR A hilarious, nicely animated film with a much more intelligent
and well thought out plot that strives miles ahead of what most recent
films can ever do. Kudos to the writer of this film, nicely done!

Zootopia is nothing like your regular Disney fare. Sure it's got cute
talking animals, some childish humor, and like almost all Disney movies
it is gorgeously animated and has a lesson to teach, but not just to
kids. This movie absolutely blew me away from the moment it began. The
messages and lessons that this film has to tell are so beyond it's
years, there were many times that I just forgot that I was watching an
animated film about a bunny who wanted to a cop. I believe that this
Disney has struck gold with this movie, not just in the terms that
Disney will make bank loads of money from ticket sales and merchandise
(cause it will), but because they created a truly well crafted, well
written, and beautifully, breathtakingly animated film that is sure to
delight children and entice their parents. Please go see Zootopia
because it IS like nothing you've seen Be-fur.Source: http://www.livingfilms.org/zootopia-2016/3552

Going in, French celebrities and festivities aside, I didn't know what
to expect. Unlike most people I didn't looove Frozen, I actually fell
asleep watching it, so I was worried. But Zootopia exceeded my
expectations with a compelling story, it's good. The story is
interesting and smart. It deals with societal issues in a very witty
way because it caters to kids as much as adults, which is probably why
there is a certain predictability about the characters but it's not at
the cost of the story or the message behind it.It's a Disney animation movie so of course there're positive teachable
messages in the movie, perseverance, tolerance, open-mindedness, all
wrapped in a funny and touching movie with characters that you'll root
for and love.Zootopia is a good time at the movies, you'll laugh and be entertain as
much as the kids. By @ericgarcy

Disney has been on a winning streak lately, releasing great animated
movies like Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6. The studio manages
to add another gem to its line-up with Zootopia: a great film that
tells a heartfelt story, while intelligently covering some delicate
themes.The film follows the endeavors of Judy Hopps, a rabbit who wants to be
a police officer in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. The
twist is that all animals are sized like they are in the real world.
Being a small rabbit, Judy is often confronted with difficulties while
trying to fulfill her dream, but she never gives up. After graduating
at the top of her class, she ends up in the metropolis of Zootopia,
where she is tasked with parking duty. Of course, Judy is not satisfied
with this trivial activity. Thanks to her determination she manages to
get assigned to a disappearance case. Since she does not get any help
from the police force, she ends up trying to crack the case with a
wayward fox named Nick.The story unfolds itself to be a heartfelt journey through some
visually stunning environments. Zootopia is divided into several
districts, including a desert, a rain forest and a snowy suburb. This
ensures the movie never looks boring, as Judy and Nick travel through
different parts of the city to solve their case. A lot of time was put
into developing the city and all its details. The rain forest district,
for example, stays humid thanks to an abundance of sprayers, ensuring
the inhabitants feel right at home.While going through their journey, both Judy and Nick learn a lot about
themselves and the world around them. Their characters are very well
developed and undergo a logical and heartfelt evolution. This is where
the movie really shines in my opinion, as it touches on some very
delicate issues such as race and discrimination. It avoids being too
preachy, but at the same time raises some really interesting questions,
both for children and adults alike. These questions are all the more
interesting when considering the recent racial tensions in the US and
the refugee crisis in Europe. I had some very interesting conversations
after the movie ended.Of course, there is also room for humor. There are a lot of puns and
predictable funny moments alluding to animal stereotypes. The jokes are
very well worked out though and they never feel cheesy.Overall, this is probably my favorite animated Disney movie since the
Disney Revival started more then five years ago. It has great, lovable
characters, a beautiful set-up, some great laughs and most importantly:
a strong positive message for both kids an adults.

. . . despite the best efforts of Wooly White Sheep to frame them for a
series of heinous Wilding Attacks. In ZOOTOPIA's Universe, about 10% of
individuals are Predators, whose DNA gives them a Savage History. The
other 90% of the population is divided between various species of Prey.
Apparently, the Evil White Sheep are jealous of the Predators'
generally Bigger Size, and their many positions of social prominence.
Consequently, the Devious White Sheep come up with a plot to poison the
Predators with covert Steroid-like injections, causing symptoms similar
to 'Roid Rage. Targeted Predators have the savage components of their
DNA activated and unleashed by the injections, causing them to suddenly
behave out of character. Whether it's starting to nibble on an opponent
in the boxing ring, beating or cheating or beheading the Predator's
White Sheep spouse, or sexually assaulting a Predator Miss Zootopia,
the secret injections begin to give Predators a Bad Name. Is there hope
for Peace in ZOOTOPIA? Do Predator Lives REALLY Matter? Come see
ZOOTOPIA to find out!

Disney's 55th animated feature film is a lively urban romp with great
comedic timing and a mysterious, slightly neo-noir flair. In a
nutshell, it's a lot of fun. However, Zootopia is somehow
simultaneously one of the most seriously and politically relevant films
of the year, greatly unexpected within a children's film from a studio
built on dreams and magic. Disney leaves the magic, so to speak, at the
door. Instead, we get the story of a little bunny's first time in the
big city where she has to handle various characters, their differences
and all the positive and negative ideals therein.The film does a fine job of blatantly dealing with current social
issues that might normally be given a subtle nod or completely swept
under the rug in a mainstream, animated film. Here, the idea that
minorities are predators capable of being savage because of where they
come from or that people from a certain area or background don't
exactly get a fare chance in life is what actually makes the film.
There is extreme prejudice and intolerance and even someone who
believes they are fighting against it can still be prejudiced themself
without even realizing it. There is a rampant and uncontrollable drug
problem within the urban communities of the city, as well as missing
people who are seemingly deemed unworthy of being found. And, of
course, there is mob-like corruption within the ranks of the delightful
animals. But there's a red herring. The film also shows that characters
with naturally gruff demeanors can still be on the side of the good and
characters that are innocent can still hustle and stand up for
themselves.While the design of the film is indeed well done, from its characters
to its locations, and the animation is top notch as usual, nothing
visually stands out as being incredible. Disney is no stranger to
anthropomorphized animals. In fact, some of the character designs in
Zootopia borrow heavily from previous characters within the company.
But, whether intentional or not, this all works to effect for the film.
Having a city scape and characters that don't immediately stand out
because they are seemingly familiar grounds the film into reality. This
is any major melting pot of a city that these indifferences are
happening in. And these are, symbolically, the same characters we come
into contact with during our everyday.Having a DMV run by sloths shows that Zootopia does its fare share of
playing up stereotypes as well, although it tries to break them by
doing so. Some minor jokes, such as not touching someone's hair or
using certain words that are only acceptable within a certain group of
people, or even using a certain dialect, are included for specific
audiences and the fact that they are there creates a feeling of
specific inclusion. It is interesting, though, that in a film that
speaks to the positive nature of opportunity and diversity, the voice
cast still boasts typical actors in the major roles. Don't get me
wrong, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as Judy and Nick respectively
are great and definitely get the job done. Idris Elba, Tommy Chong,
Octavia Spencer and Shakira, among a handful of others, are equally
enjoyable and round out the diversity of the film's cast, but all in
mostly minor roles.That is to say, it would be nice if a studio of Disney's caliber and
reach could tell an animated story just like this, but without hiding
behind furry animals that could be voiced by anyone, instead actually
showing the differences and struggles of humanity with actual humans of
difference races, creeds and backgrounds that we don't often get to see
in animation. It's understandable, though, to use fuzzy bunnies and
foxes to lighten the load of some of these harsh, real world themes in
a children's movie. They also help in getting the movie to hit a bigger
audience, which is important for this kind of story. Disney has indeed
taken a major step forward with Zootopia, a socially and politically
conscious film that probably no one ever expected from the mouse.

Maintaining a creepy mustache is a lifestyle choice. One of the
unfortunate consequences of said lifestyle choice is being forced to
feel awkward whenever you go see a children's movie, alone, in a dark
theatre, filled to the brim with excited youths. Zootopia makes almost
all of that awkwardness worth the trip.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an ambitious, young bunny, looking to
prove herself as the first rabbit police officer in the bustling
metropolis of Zootopia. Seen as little more than meek prey by her
coworkers, peers, and even her family, she must learn to overcome these
prejudices, and work with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a cunning fox, to
crack an impenetrable case.From Disney, you'd expect nothing less than top notch animation, and
Zootopia undoubtedly delivers on that front. The colors are vibrant,
playful, and inviting, as we move from dense, jungle rainforests, to
blisteringly icy tundras, to urban cityscapes. The lighting,
especially, is awe inspiring, specifically during Mr. Big's (Maurice
LaMarche) daughter's wedding. It makes the entire sequence feel
ethereal, if not like an altogether blatant homage to The Godfather.The voice acting, too, is excellent. Idris Elba is an intimidating
presence as Chief Bogo, and Ginnifer Goodwin is totally endearing and
lovable in a role that could have, in lesser hands, devolved into
something saccharine and obnoxious. The real standout, however, is
Jason Bateman, who consistently reminds me how he is one of the most
versatile and underrated workhorses in Hollywood. He delivers a brassy,
jaded performance, that is somehow imbued with the charisma and charm
of a young Robert Redford. Bateman's Nick Wilde is a total dick, but
goddamn it if I don't love that dick.As it claws tenaciously at greatness, Zootopia is tethered to the realm
of merely good Disney films by its script. Sure, there are a handful of
legitimately funny jokes (and one bizarrely out of place Breaking Bad
reference) peppered in for some strong laughs, but the plot is
generally predictable, and sticks to tried and true Disney formula. If
that formula were perfectly executed, then all would be forgiven, but a
sloppy, rushed third act, and an unbearably heavy-handed message that
is handled with all of the nuance and discreetness with which crocodile
might attack its prey, really hamper the film. It is almost cringe
inducing at times, yet a slightly longer running time, and a little
dialogue revision would have done the film a world of good.Don't let me scare you off, though. Zootopia is a fine film that
definitely earns your money. Whether you're a parent looking for a
cheap diversion that'll entertain you and your kids, or a student
looking for a harmless, inoffensive flick to watch after midterms, you
could do far worse. Just promise me you won't go see Gods of Egypt.

Absolute Fun, Right from beginning to End.I think animated movies now a days have begun to be more the moral,
emotional or very intelligent affair, so the fun part usually takes a
back seat.Zootopia is not like those movies at all. It is what more animated
movies should aspire to be. It is a movie where i can take a 8-10 yr
old and still both of us would end up having fun (Pixar does not make
such movies anymore). The characters of Zootopia were awesome. The 3D
was spectacular. The story pace beautiful. So kudos to Disney. A job well Done.

The movie introduced an amazing world to us. Interesting story and well

Clawhauser was so funny.The voice roles were excellent. The movie was pretty hilarious. I
laughed and smiled all the time. The animation was amazing. The
direction cared with every single detail in every scene giving us a
wonderful experience in our journey to Zootopia. Yes, It was a
wonderful journey. Also it has positive and motivational messages to
all of us.Some people might say that this movie is not genius. Maybe they are
right and maybe they are wrong. But to me the movie succeeded in
everything I want.Finally, Shakira's song " Try Everything " at the end of the movie was
superb.The movie is tons of fun . I had a total blast with Zootopia. Go see

The buddy cop genre. It's seen a lot of unique takes over the years,
but this is certainly one of the most memorable. The best way to
describe this film is Who Framed Roger Rabbit meets Crash. Our main
characters are a police bunny named Judy Hopps (played by Jenifer
Goodwin) and a con artist fox named Nick Wilde (played by Jason
Bateman). Judy has a tough and no-nonsense attitude while Nick is more
careless and manipulative, so these two characters play off each other
perfectly. The rest of the casting is perfect. I can't think of a
single role that was miscast. I especially love Idris Elba as the
police commissioner. The story goes that Judy is used to live in a
rural town, where she dreams of moving to the metropolin city of
Zootopia to become a police officer. The problem is that no one, not
even the commissioner, takes a rabbit seriously as a cop. She is given
the duty of meter maid and eventually encounters Nick, who later
becomes an important source of information during a mysterious
kidnapping plot. Although the film has many humorous moments, it also
has some very emotional ones, especially during flashbacks. The
stuggles that both these characters have to put up with feels very
genuine and realistic, much like the problems that we have today with
race, religion, and sexuality. The only thing I thought could have used
more work was the writing. It's not bad, and there are some memorable
lines, but some jokes fall flat (like the Godfather spoof). Thankfully
there are a lot more that work than those that don't. The action scenes
are a lot of fun very creative, and the film itself is animated
beautifully. Do I recommend this film? The short answer is yes. The
long answer is that it depends on what you're looking for. If you want
a fun little buddy cop film with a few tear-jerking moments, then
you'll love Zootopia.

Zootopia tells the story of a bunny named, Judy Hopps(Ginnifer
Goodwin). Ever since she was a kid, it has always been Judy's dream to
help her fellow animals, by becoming a police officer. In the world of
Zootopia, humans never happened. Thousands of years ago, animals used
to be savages, with predators hunting for their prey & the prey relying
on their natural instinct to survive. Then, the civilized society was
born. Predators & prey, learned to peacefully co-exist. Zootopia is a
city where all the anthropomorphic animals live together. There are
various small towns near Zootopia, that are inhabited by one particular
species. Judy Hopps goes to Zootopia to pursue her dream, of becoming a
cop. After all the required exams & field exercises, Judy finally
becomes the first rabbit ever, to become a cop. While on the job,
Officer Hopps soon realizes that being a cop is not exactly as
dignified & rewarding, as she thought it would be. She finally gets an
opportunity to prove her mettle as a police officer. Along with the
help of a wily fox named Nick Wilde(Jason Bateman), Judy goes about
solving this mystery. While on the job, Judy & Nick unearth a
diabolical conspiracy, that will affect the entire society. Zootopia is a great movie! The animation is otherworldly. The city of
Zootopia looks really authentic, & feels like a city that any
anthropomorphic animal would flock to, for greener pastures. All the
small towns around Zootopia, are gorgeous. I especially loved the rain
forests. The 3D immerses the viewer, right in the middle of this
beautiful world. Although this movie is wonderful, it doesn't reach the
pinnacle of perfection like other recent Disney animated movies like,
Wreck-It Ralph(2012) & Big Hero 6(2014). The various set pieces
throughout the movie, are highly engaging & will keep you on the edge
of your seat. Kids & adults will love this movie. There is a ton of
heart in the film. However, one recipe missing from this movie, that
make all Disney animated movies flawless, is humor. There are hardly
any comedic set pieces in the movie. Even when there are, these jokes
are mainly meant only for children. The sloth gag is funny at first
but, it gets tedious really fast. This is a very minor flaw though.
This movie is as unique as all the other Walt Disney Animation Studios
& Pixar movies, to date. The highlight of the film is the suspense.
This is the first animated film, that has a major mystery element
throughout. The voice acting is spot on. Ginnifer Goodwin is
spectacular as Judy Hopps. Jason Bateman is outstanding as Nick Wilde.
Idris Elba is perfect as Chief Bogo. Jenny Slate is amazing as
Bellwether. Nate Torrence is awesome as Clawhauser. Bonnie Hunt & Don
Lake are good as, Bonnie Hopps & Stu Hopps, respectively. Tommy Chong
is hilarious as Yax. J.K. Simmons is superb as Mayor Lionheart. Octavia
Spencer is great as Mrs. Otterton. Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Raymond S.
Persi & Della Saba are impressive as, Duke Weaselton, Gazelle, Flash &
Young Hopps, respectively. Maurice LaMarche is effective as Mr. Big.
Zootopia is a must watch, with your whole family.

Pixar can't seem to do anything wrong, can they? First with Inside Out
last year, and back at it again with Zootopia. This movie is a feel
good movie that touches the heart, and that preaches that being
different is okay. The premise is that a city where animals(both
predator and prey) can live in harmony safe from the actual food chain,
until something goes horribly wrong which seemingly reverts back to
pre-civilized days. Idris Elba leads a cast that entertains you
throughout the movie, and makes it so you can't not like this movie. It
is beautifully made, and an eye-catcher at that. The cute subtleness of
how all animals are different is on a whole new level, especially after
the whole "Chris Rock can make a black joke" a the Academy Awards just
a week ago. RATING: I would give this movie a high 7/low 8. Primarily
because it didn't have as much meaning I feel, as say Finding Nemo,
Wall-E, or Toy Story. However, with that being said, this movie is a
no-doubt must see. Who can say no to Pixar? REVIEW: To summarize this
movie in one word it'd have to be "touching" where it makes you laugh,
smile, cry, and basically feel everything Inside Out wanted you to...
AGE: Approved for all ages, and all audiences.

Who says family films only have children to preach to? Well, actually
I'm not entirely sure if anyone's ever said that, but it sure sounds
like they would though, huh? That debate aside, Disney gets it with its
newest installment. Without sounding clichÃ© and trite, Zootopia is
literally fun for the whole family. It takes place in a world where animals, both predator and prey, live
together in harmony-- except not really. Although things have seemed to
change, all the animals still have their reservations and fears about
one another. Obviously mirroring a place where our own society is right
now, as far as race and religion. The whole movie features various species facing intolerance, while
digging into and showcasing possible responses to the prejudices
against them--perhaps containing the true depth within this film. The
themes are obvious to the adults, but subliminal to the kids. Which is
a good thing. It deals with a dark subject matter, and the filmmakers
aren't afraid to give us that respective tone either.The main character is Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny
rabbit who is finally living her dream of being a police officer in the
big city. But she faces adversity since the job is usually held by
rhinos or elephants. She's given a case where she has to find an otter
who's gone missing--a mystery that adds another fun feature to an
already interesting concept. However, it doesn't come until about 35
minutes in--right when you're starting to wonder to yourself what the
setup is for.In a refreshing fashion, the writers aren't talking down to their
younger audience. It's funny without being over-the-top and irreverent.
When the jokes don't work as well, it's never in an embarrassing way.
In fact, there may even be more jokes for the adults in this one.
However, there are plenty of aesthetic visuals to keep the children
entertained for the full runtimeAnimation alone, Zootopia is beautifully detailed. There's so much of
it that it's not even possible to see it all in one sitting. And while
you're watching it, you wish there were a place just like it where you
could visit as soon as the movie finishes.Twizard Rating: 99

I did not think Disney had it in them to create something as
sophisticated as Zootopia. It's slightly off the Disney formula than you would expect as it talks
to the entire audience, not just children about the lessons of
tolerance.Zootopia is about a bunny who is told she can not be a cop because
she's a bunny, who teams up with a Fox, who this bunny has been told
since birth that his kind cannot be trusted, in order to solve the case
of some missing animals.It's been a while since I've seen Disney do this style of
Anthropomorphism (not since the Disney Afternoon, with such shows as
Tale Spin, which this movie reminds me of) , but it is a great way to
tell a very mature story about not judging a book by it's cover and
feeding it to everyone. Brovo!

Walking into this movie I had VERY low hopes that I would be
entertained. And by the end, I was brow-beating myself for judging this
wonderful movie by it's cover! (A message the movie covers well) It was
full of humor, full of entertainment, and with a message to boot. A
rarity these days with movies having a over abundance of low-brow
slapstick and toilet humor. The pop-culture references are going to be over the children's head
(just the way some should) and in perfect place for the adults to catch
it and say "Ahh, that was clever". Yet still showing more than enough
to relate with child-like humor, that will keep even the most restless
5 yr old at attention. A movie that is supremely voiced by
actors/actresses that matched their characters so well, that from now
on I will see the characters in their next performances...Which is a
great thing.I do recommend anyone to take the family to see this..a few times.

I had no idea this movie would be as good as it is when I went into the
theater. I figured it would be decent just because of the pedigree with
people like Byron Howard and Rich Moore working on it but this turned
out being one of the best children's films I've seen in a long time.
It's also impressive just how topical some of these issues are that are
dealt with in the story. If you haven't seen it yet then do yourself a
favor and go out and watch it immediately. You won't regret it.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a young rabbit that has become the
first rabbit ever to be accepted by Zootopia's police force. Zootopia
is a city where all kinds of different animals live together in peace.
Judy starts her new job on the force but is having trouble since
everyone underestimates her since she's a tiny bunny rabbit. She
finally gets the chance to prove herself when she's put in charge of a
missing animals case. She teams up with a cunning fox named Nick Wilde
(Jason Bateman) and goes out to find out where the animals are but ends
up uncovering a plot to change Zootopia forever.This movie has an excellent cast but it feels like most of these
high-profile children's films always do. Goodwin does an excellent job
as the upbeat and personable Judy. She's extremely positive but there
are plenty of scenes in the film where we see a side of Judy that's
afraid of failure and eager to please her superiors. Bateman's Wilde is
very calm and collected in most situations but he also has a more
caring side and is defensive of his friends. It's great seeing the
relationship these two build with one another throughout the movie. I
also want to give kudos to Idris Elba's Chief Bogo and J.K. Simmons's
Mayor Lionheart. These two characters easily steal every scene that
they're in and are probably my favorite characters in the entire film.This movie has so many positives going for it that it's hard to think
of anything wrong with the film. The animation is incredibly well done
and there are tons of different locales to flesh out the adventure. The
characters are incredibly likable and genuinely funny. Speaking of
funny, the jokes will easily make the young ones laugh but I'm
surprised how much of the humor is geared towards adults. The only
thing I didn't really like about the film was the character of Gazelle
and the music of Shakira. I don't have anything against the songs in
the movie, it's just not really my type of music.The thing that really impressed me with the story was the way they
dealt with prejudice. This is something that I wasn't expecting in a
children's movie but the backbone of the plot deals with the different
prejudices felt by the main characters. Judy, Nick, even Chief Bogo and
a myriad of others all feel some degree of prejudice whether because
they feel they're better than others or because they were wronged by
another and ended up blaming an entire set of animals because of it. I
don't want to spoil too much if you guys haven't watched the film yet
but it is really interesting how they were able to integrate such a hot
button issue into this movie.I can't recommend this film enough. I absolutely loved it and I thought
it was easily one of the best family movies I've seen in a long time.
My only complaint is that I didn't enjoy some of the songs in the film
but literally everything else I absolutely adored. Take the kids or
friends or whatever and go watch this heartwarming movie as soon as
possible.

Disney's latest animated feature is smart, funny and beautifully
animated. It might look like your standard talking animal fare, but it
has a lot going on, with some smart metaphors and a complex story.
Zootopia is an enormous city full of anthropomorphic mammals who have
evolved to live together in a cooperative society that consists of both
predators and prey of every sort - they have long since given up on
being enemies. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Judy Hopps, the first rabbit to
make it onto the Zootopia police force - though all mammals have
supposed equality, prejudices kind of rule their society, and such a
small creature has never been able to be in such a position before.
Judy is initially given simple duties, but she insists on being more
and eventually finds her way into a major investigation of disappearing
citizens. She teams up with a con artist fox (Jason Bateman), and the
two search for clues. The film introduces a lot to think about; it
definitely could get young ones considering things like prejudice,
stereotypes and racism, and without ever seeming obvious or preachy.
The characters are great and the animation wonderful. I did think the
story resolves itself way too easily, like, at a certain point, the
filmmakers either hit a wall and decided they had to take a shortcut to
the end, or perhaps they were thinking a young audience would be
getting bored so they just hand the protagonists the answer to hurry
things along. The film still may be above younger audience members'
heads - the smallest kids in my theater seemed to grow tired of it
quickly. All in all, it's a good time and a fine addition to the Disney
canon.

Prejudice is very difficult to root out. (Yeah, this is a review about
an animated Disney movie, but why can't a family film also have a more
mature message?) Unlike discrimination, which refers to overt acts that
society can deal with (mostly) through properly-enforced laws and
well-designed public policy, prejudice is an attitude and cannot be
legislated away. The word prejudice developed from the medieval legal
term "prejudgment" and today refers to a wide variety of prejudgments
that people make every day, based on someone else's association with a
certain group. These are prejudices people often hold for their entire
lives Â– sometimes without even realizing it. Does being a Muslim mean
supporting terrorism or being atheist mean lacking morals? Is being
short a sign of weakness or being fat an indication of gluttony? Are
most black people criminals or most whites racist? Most (if not all) of
us would answer "no" to all these questions if asked by another person,
and would probably feel we were answering honestly. ButÂ… do our actions
or choice of words at other times betray some deep-seated prejudices we
may not be aware that we have? Along with being an excellent movie
which most people will find entertaining regardless of their age, the
animated feature "Zootopia" (PG, 1:48) subtly asks these questions to
the more mature members of the audience, while carrying important
messages to all.Zootopia is a big city in a land where humans don't exist and
anthropomorphic animals have formed their own orderly society. Having
evolved beyond their primal roles of predator and prey, they all live
together in relative peace and harmony, except when jealousy, greed or
prejudices raise their ugly heads. (Hey, animals are people too.) One
of those walking talking animals is Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer
Goodwin), a young female bunny who fulfills her much-derided childhood
dream of becoming the first rabbit to join the Zootopia Police
Department. As Judy leaves behind her parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don
Lake), and her 275 siblings, to take the train from rural Bunnyburrow
into the colorful big city with its tall buildings and varied habitat
neighborhoods, you can easily imagine Taylor Swift's "Mean" playing in
the background. But the meanness doesn't stop when Judy starts her new
hard-won job.When Judy takes her place among the wolves, lions, tigers, rhinos and
elephants that she now calls colleagues, they all overlook her
(literally and figuratively). Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a cape buffalo,
assigns her parking meter duty, at which she immediately excels, but
she wants more out of her job than being a meter maid. She becomes
aware of the mysterious disappearance of over a dozen animals from
different predatory species around the city and she promises one
worried wife (Octavia Spencer) that she will help. Judy develops a lead
which takes her to a con-man fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) whom
she promptly cons into helping her pursue that lead. The trail of
evidence they follow takes them to a naturist club run by a
free-spirited Yak (Tommy Chong), to a DMV office run by sloths (a
clever joke supported by the voices of Raymond S. Persi and Kristen
Bell), to the feared crime boss Mr. Big (Maurice LeMarche), to City
Hall to get the help of Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwhether (Jenny Slate)
and to a secret medical facility controlled by Mayor Lionheart (JK
Simmons). As Judy and Nick figure out what's really going on, they
learn some surprising and important things about each other Â– and
themselves."Zootopia" really does have something for everyone. The littlest
audience members will enjoy the colorful scenery, the variety of
animals and the action sequences, and are likely to identify with the
undersized main character with oversized dreams. Teens and adults will
appreciate the sly references to "Breaking Bad" and "The Godfather",
the presence of Shakira as a singing gazelle known as "Gazelle" and the
important lessons about fighting to be taken seriously and the damaging
effects of prejudice. As well-written, well-animated and well-voiced as
this film is, its main strength and importance lie in its messages.
Prejudice is shown as self-perpetuating and, when allowed to exist
unchallenged, actually able to reverse society's progress in the areas
of equality and tolerance. Unfortunately, those lessons, as important
as they are, sometimes come off a bit oversimplified Â– and so central
to the story, that it's not quite as much fun as I'd expect an animated
film to be. Still, "Zootopia" is an excellent family film. "A-"

The people developing stories for Disney films have got it down to a
science. Zootopia opens with a sequence designed to make you love its
heroine right from the beginning and moves through the beats of the
hero's journey so dexterously, it's over before you realize how it
happened. Like Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph, it differs from the
traditional content of Disney classics, taking us on an emotional
journey through a completely unique sort of world rather than one from
European fairy tales. The setting and characters are strong
points--much of the comedy comes from the viewer's understanding of
Judy and Nick's personalities rather than setting up and paying off
gags. The plot is more like the complicated, twisting scripts we
usually get from Pixar films, and like the best Pixar movies,
everything ties together and fits logically (BH6 and WIR were able to
do that notably well, also). There isn't a strong, memorable villain,
but it probably didn't need one with two lead characters as likable as
Judy and Nick. There weren't many songs, and it might not have a prince
and princess, but I expect people will want to visit Zootopia again and
again.

I knew it was going to be good but I didn't know I was going to like it
as much as I did. The trailers don't do it justice, but do the great
thing of not revealing a single story detail. I went in completely not
knowing what the plot was, aside from the basics.The animation was incredibly beautiful to look at, it was really funny,
and really cute when it needed to be. The music was great, the voice
acting was perfect.It overall sends a great message that is needed in today's society,
without going into too much detail as to spoil the fun. Seriously, give
this one a chance if you haven't already. It most likely won't be what
you expect.

Disney has done an incredible job with storytelling over the years.
They give us films fused with real-world problems and explain it so
well that children can truly understand what's going on in the world
today. Adults and parents are also reminded of the problems we have
through their storytelling. "Zootopia" is another film in which they
accomplish just that."Zootopia" is a place where all animals, predators and prey alike, get
along. It's a city where any animal can chase their wildest dreams,
while coexisting with all other species. We follow Judy Hopps (Ginnifer
Goodwin), a rabbit who was told she could never become a cop. She
completes the police academy and moves to Zootopia to follow her
dreams. Judy is first assigned to parking ticket duty. Frustrated, she
then takes the seemingly impossible task of finding a kidnapped Otter.
She sees that she needs help, and finds the clever fox Nick Wilde
(Jason Bateman) to accompany her on her quest. On her journey she finds
very revealing details about some of the animals and the case gets very
interesting."Zootopia" is absolutely hilarious and still carries all the heart-
warming and tear-jerking moments Disney is so wonderful at creating.
The voice-over work is flawless and is filled with an incredible
supporting cast.Most importantly, the creators show us discrimination in a different
way on the big screen so everyone can witness what's happening everyday
all around us. They show us the problems with diversity and immigration
in a way everyone can understand, even children, which are the future
and we can't allow these problems to continue.The city reminds me of New York City, and we must remember the poem on
the Statue of Liberty. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled
masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming
shore." This should still be deemed true today.Check out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!

The first half of this movie is pretty much Disney-by-the-numbers. The
little bunny who dreams of being a police officer fights prejudice
triggered by her diminutive size and timid race. (The other police
officers are all large, ferocious animals like lions and tigers and
bears and even rhinoceroses.) Her parents try to convince her to stick
with what they and their family have always done, but she refuses to
buy into their complacency. Others make fun of her because she's a
rabbit. Etc.The scene at the DMV where it turns out that the clerks are all sloths
had the adults in the audience, including myself, laughing out loud,
though the little children had no idea why their parents were laughing.But then, when we finally start to understand what is behind the
disappearance of the 12 predators - is it 12 by chance, I wonder? -
that there has been an attempt to seize political power in the city by
ramping up one group's fear of another group based on supposed racial
character traits, this movie moves from the pleasant world of Disney
animation to the current political scene. There is no attempt to make
any group of animals look like Muslims, or Mexicans, or ..., nor any of
the fear-mongers look like Trump or Cruz or ..., but you'd have to be a
6 year old not to see what the movie is trying to say. Suddenly it is
speaking to the parents who dutifully brought their kids to yet another
Disney animated movie, not to sell them merchandise but to wake them up
to the current political scene.Do the parents see that the movie is now talking to them, about now? I
don't know. But when the Fox, to prove his point, suddenly pretends to
attack Judy Rabbit and Judy goes for her fox repellent even though the
Fox has become her good friend - or has he? - you are forced to come to
terms with the fact that, even behind most of our pc verbiage a
socially-instilled fear of others who are different is still in us, and
can be exploited by those who want to use us to gain power for
themselves.I have no idea what the little children in the audience today came away
with. To judge from their restlessness as the movie went on and became
more serious, perhaps not a lot.But the parents who were able to keep watching in between trying to
keep their little ones still might, at least for a moment, have gotten
a rather remarkable reflection on the current presidential race.Going back to such early feature-length movies as *Bambi*, the Disney
Studios have often found some of their best material in the things that
really frighten us. Not cheap horror fear, but deep-down fears that
reside inside us. Bambi's mother warned her young child to beware the
hunters because they were a real source of danger, and that masterpiece
made them terrifying though it never showed them to us - or perhaps
because it never showed them to us. This Disney picture warns us, too,
about another sort of danger. The fear is of a different kind, but no
less menacing.

It's quite amazing how far computer graphics have come in films. Watch
an older film like "Toy Story" or "Shrek" and you'll see what I mean.
They were the cutting edge CGI movies when they came out but when seen
today you realize just how far they've come since then. As an
experiment, try watching one of these older films and then see the best
computer animated film you can find, "Zootopia", and you'll see just
how far they've come. The characters not only are gorgeously animated
but the film is so rich in texture. Scenes of the characters flying
through a rain forest or walking in a bustling metropolis simply look
astounding. Combine with that some of the nicest 3D effects you can
find and some very lovable characters and you've got a winner.The story is set in a world without humans. However, these animals act
and dress much like people. Oddly, however, the predators and prey have
somehow worked out their differences and live in peace. However,
despite it seeming like a paradise, there still are some prejudices in
this world. Animals are often locked within expectations...and the cute
bunny, Judy Hopps, finds out the hard way about these expectations. As
a child, she wanted to be a police officer...but she finds that the
expectation is that they be the huge, hulking animals...the wolves, the
rhinos, the elephants and the bears. But Judy is persistent and fights
these prejudices in order to become the first rabbit cop...but along
the way she learns that hard way that she, too, has prejudices of her
own and her new unlikely friend, a fox, helps to show her that she,
too, has a way to go when it comes to expectations. Fortunately, while
this strong message of political correctness and inclusion is clearly
there, it's not obnoxious in its presentation. Additionally, there is a
mystery within the story that is clever and diverting...and offers some
nice twists as well.So is the film perfect? Not quite. Unlike the typical CGI film, this
one did not have a short the preceded it and because of this I felt a
bit cheated since this has become the norm for most computer animated
films from major studios. Additionally, some might find the message
within the film to be a bit heavy-handed...though I didn't mind.
Overall, this is a great film for all ages....something that makes it a
major plus for families. Parents won't feel like taking a nap and kids
will be captivated because the film, if anything, is amazingly cute!

Plot: Judy Hopps is a small village bunny who dreams of becoming a
police officer but always gets discouraged by everyone as no rabbit has
even tried it before. She eventually aces at police academy & gets
posted to Zootopia, a city where all animals are equal & live in
harmony. But soon she faces harsh reality & gets assigned as parking
meter maid. Judy makes a deal with her chief Bogo to solve case of
missing animal within 48 hrs or she'll resign. For this she takes help
of a fox, Nick, who is a hustler, a con artist. But it turns out it is
more than just missing case & something more sinister is going on. Will
Judy find out in time? forms rest of story.Positives: The film cleverly portrays situation of our society & deep
roots of inequality, racism & caste among us. It delivers strong
messages that- No matter what, never give up. Your race, your caste
don't decide what will be. Anyone can do anything. The story skilfully
combines elements of morale, comic & suspense giving you an
entertaining ride. There're plenty of funny moments, like the scene
with sloths or Nick making 'pawsicles', or underworld don Mr. Big. And
as expected from Disney, all animations are top class.Negatives: Nil.Opinion: An entertaining film which succeeds in maintaining perfect
balance between fun & delivering message which can be enjoyed by both
kids & adults.

Visually, it's a treat. Storytelling-wise, it doesn't live up to the
hype. The problem with this film is that it's trying to be both a "message"
movie and a film noir detective mystery type deal. But the fact that
it's so strongly a "message" movie robs the detective element of all
its suspense. The two main characters are likable but nobody else
really registers. This is what some would call a "SJW" movie about
discrimination, racism, tolerance, etc., but the dialogue is dry and
the humor is still very basic, it's stereotypical and often
animal-based (sloths are slow, cops eat donuts, rabbits breed immensely
fast, a joke they milk repeatedly. There are only two vaguely funny
scenes, and one was spoiled in an early trailer and wears out its
welcome as you're watching it. I really don't see why there's so much love and hype for this. Sure the
art and animation are great, but the characters are nothing special,
plus the story was predictable and followed the beats of any other
police movie. There isn't much that I really enjoyed. The world-
building hardly even makes sense. Who decided to build this big city
with ridiculously different climates rather than just building multiple
cities? What does the metropolis produce for the rest of the world?
What do the predators eat if not the herbivores/omnivores? Why do the
little critters have their mini-city of Little Rodentia in THE MIDDLE
of this vast metropolis? If this is a kids' movie, why are there dark
scenes where a mafioso modeled after Don Corleone (very original, guys)
threatens characters with torture and death (and the second time around
he has the approval of the main characters, who are standing around
with grins on their faces)? Also there's that yawn-inducing procedural trope where a character is
about to reveal EVERYTHING but succumbs to a fit of violence, only to
artificially increase the level of intrigue at play. When the answer to
the "night terrors" question presents itself it's out of nowhere and
should have been something these smart phone using animals could have
looked up in 2 seconds. There's a lot of hare brained storytelling
decisions made here. Not to mention much of the movie drags on with a seemingly endless
amount of familiar empowerment tropes. The only thing that saves the
film from completely collapsing under the weight of its cheerless
social justice mission is the way Judy and Nick are written and the
banter they share. Honestly... just because this makes some people and
movie critics feel better about themselves doesn't change the fact that
it's just an OK Disney movie. If it changed your life, good for you.
But don't pretend it's some kind of masterpiece.

The result did not match the marketing. Story is so so but visuals like
usual so great and pretty. Yep, children love what they see and what
story? Basic zoology that fox eats rabbit, predator and prey, habitat,
animal behavior etc. Then this prey and predator become friends and
escaped the horror of deviantart. Rabbit jumps, fox is sly, lion mayor,
wolf in sheep's clothing, otter is a predator (the predators are bulky
and this is a cutie???), sloth is slow. This year children will learn
so much about animals adding zyuohger and kung fu panda and what else?
I was wrong to hope for a good story from a cartoon but oh well who
cares when you got beautiful art.

Allow me to preface this by saying I work in the film industry. As
someone who works in production, I've seen a lot of movies. And by a
lot, I mean A LOT, so what I'm about to tell you may not be your
experience, and you should by no means decide on seeing a movie based
on one guy's opinion.With that being said- I've been a Disney fan all of my life. I grew up
with the classic animated musicals, I found Nemo Incredible and
Wreck-It Ralph Frozen(not really, but titles are fun), so naturally I
thought Zootopia was going to be a surefire hit. And it was. Kind of.
It had all of the elements- the odd couple duo, the social themes and
let's not forget the breathtaking animation(and by God, it was
beautiful). However, there was something missing. It seemed that Disney phoned it in this time, I could see every plot
point coming a mile away. It was predictable, rushed(typically Disney
leaves little jokes hidden in the background, and despite the clever
layout of the city, that was lacking. Michael Giacchino's score
couldn't even save it.Perhaps my standards were too high. If you expect perfection, a B+
feels like an F. So go see it if you want to, don't if you don't, I don't care. Just
consider yourself warned.

This March Hare of a movie is a lot of fun. Plenty of Easter Eggs worth
checking out! Zootopia has everything that the general audience, might
be looking for, in an animation movie. Set in a world where walking,
talking, "civilized" animals live in general harmony with one another,
regardless of whether they're predator or prey. A small-town rabbit
Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) achieves her childhood dream of
becoming the first rabbit cop; only to find out, that she been
relegates to a safe, but boring parking-duty assignment. However,
things started to change, as animals around the city, start to go wild.
With a street smart, sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), she might be
the city's only hope in solving this mystery, once and for all.
Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, this movie is so much deeper
and mature than previous Disney anthropomorphic animal films, like
1973's Robin Hood & 2005's Chicken Little. It does a great job of
teaching audiences important moral lessons about tolerance, and
respecting, those who might be different to you. I love how egalitarian
ideals are challenged by Zootopia's stereotypical political prejudices
here. Its shows how animalistic, human are being, toward each other.
It's really needed, social commentary. I love the use of animals as the
message without being heavy-handed or preachy. While, the movie is able
to do that well, the movie does have a large number of unanswered
questions that kinda bug me about its exposition delivering. I know
that these animals has indeed evolve; but wouldn't the so-called animal
look a little different than its normal counterparts? After all, in
this world, "Survival of the fittest" & "Natural selection' doesn't
really existed in this world, as much as it does in our world. Here is
a good example: most of the movie plays off, the fact that predators
are turning back, toward their former selves. However, wouldn't these
creatures, couldn't have those normal animalistic behaviors like their
previous selves, because the fact, that they evolve from creatures that
hasn't eaten meat, or hunt in many of years. I get that, maybe, they're
just feel the force to kill, because of drugs, but I can't find myself,
believing, that they want to eat their prey, when they haven't done,
so, in many of years. Also, how in the hell, are they still considered
'predators' if they don't eat the prey? The only idea, I got is that,
they allow to eat, lots of many lower forms of life like other
vertebrates and invertebrates creatures. However, this change in diet,
doesn't allow them, to keep their normal animalistic features? If they
became all vegans; wouldn't these 'predators', honestly look more like
normal herbivores? Even the herbivores would look and act different,
since they evolve into creatures that lost some normal features, due to
no longer, needed to be used. Also, what standards of animal evolution,
makes these animal choose, which creature can or cannot be eaten. Is
mammals, the only ones sapient in this world? I find that odd, because
some invertebrate and vertebrate creatures like reptiles, arachnids,
amphibians, crustaceans, birds, jellyfishes and fishes do have some
intelligent right to not be eaten. Who is considered as sapient, who is
not? Maybe, I'm thinking, too much on it, since this is after all, a
cartoon, but it's a good question for a debate. Still, the movie is
relentlessly entertaining enough to overlook those logically questions.
It's a well-rounded film. The computer animation from Disney animation
studios looks amazing and beautiful. I love the look of the futuristic
look of the city and how it's operates. The action scenes in this film
were intense and full of danger. The neo-noir murder-mystery is
suspenseful, dark and thrilling. The jokes were mostly clever and
funny. Love the mixer of adult humor with that of childish ones. Love
all the references and homages. Glad to even see, some non-Disney ones,
like 1972's Godfather & AMC's Breaking Bad TV Show. The family,
friendship and relationship dramatic is heart-warming and well
development. Voice actors, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are spot
on, with their characters. I love the constantly energetic, optimistic
Judy working the sly, con man attitude of Nick. It made for very good
chemistry. The supporting cast is just as amazing. Also, mad props go
to composter, Michael Giacchino & singer, Shakira for the catchy 'Try
Everything' theme song of this film. The music and soundtrack is
stunning to listen to. Overall: This animated adventure is equal parts
buddy-cop comedy, fish-out-of-water tale, and whodunit mystery is a
great movie. With its vibrant visuals, simple but evocative storyline,
and important social commentary, Zootopia is a talking-animal pic worth
watching with the whole family. A must-watch for everybody.

After the tale of two princesses in wintry landscape, action sci-fi
with cuddly robot, and now enchanting buddy cop movie with bunny and
fox, I will never doubt Disney again. There's something legitimate
magical there, as it never fails to bring an ageless spectacle of witty
humor, great visual and charming characters. "Zootopia" is not only a
nice story with social commentary, it's also a detective, dare I say,
thriller, which is unexpectedly crazy and brilliant.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a spirited bunny with one goal in
mind; to become a cop, despite whatever her size and other might tell
her. Her chirpy nature makes it near impossible not to cheer for her,
and this might be the most delightful bunny in decades not named Bugs.
Her peculiar partner in crime is Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) who is a
con man with possible golden heart hidden inside his shifty golden fur.
He's a contrast to Judy, a more realistic type and using sly wit to
overcome striking prejudice.These two have excellent chemistry, in a crime thriller style no less.
Disney is well known to incorporate action nowadays, but full-fledged
detective work, it's mental that this works tremendously well. The
pacing moves in haste, and still giving enough hints for the noir to
move nicely and the audience to follow it closely. The atmosphere can
be dark at several occasions to create dread, yet never too
overwhelming for its family friendly nature.Visual is good as expected, it's a nice set-up for animal kingdoms, in
the urban environment. There are multiple references for pop and modern
culture, in fact some of the jokes come in form of familiar daily life
routines. The other bulk is in the expense of Judy as she hits speed
bump along the way to accomplish her dream. Still, what could be somber
tone is delivered with delectably mocking tone.This is also a forum to delicately show social values without being too
heavy-handed. The movie tries to present this serious element and
fortunately, it benefits from the mild colorful production to deliver
the message in friendly and approachable way. It has the captivating
city vista from Big Hero 6, nifty little homage just like Wreck-It
Ralph and even better cop drama the last Die Hard movie. The way it
balanced everything together is nothing short of amazing.The streets of "Zootopia" offers light amusement, great humor, glossy
noir theme and adorably inspirational characters in every scene. In the
risk of being utterly corny, Judy and company will hop into your, old
or young, heart.

I went yesterday to see this movie with my sister, and we laughed when
we saw that the entire cinema was full of children and parents. But I
have to say that we were the ones who enjoyed it the most! Great movie,
excellent graphics and a very entertaining story. I loved how this
movie has been made; they have taken care of even the smallest details.
The city of Zootopia is absolutely beautiful. It is funny to see how
the houses and roads are shown. A very original and fresh plot. The
characters are very well developed. Their emotions are very realistic,
and you can relate to them. The dialogue is very well made and you
laugh loudly at times.Great movie!

Zootopia (2016) Movie ReviewOriginal Score:4/4 Movie: ***** (5/5) Quality: ***** (5/5)A whole new world Zootopia turned out to be. I underestimated you, my
furry friend(I'm talking to you, Zootopia.). But you have taught me to
grow new respect for all living beings, especially other life forms.
Animals, as we humans call ourselves and many other creatures that
inhabit our dear old Earth.Zootopia (2016), the latest film from Disney. A film that blends some
(irresistible) comedy, strong positive messages and themes, a strange
concept that has created a whole new world, emotion and finally, a
powerful story. What's it all about? The story centers upon Bunny
officer Judy Hopps (Voiced powerfully by Ginnifer Goodwin.), who dreams
to become a police officer despite her species and size as a rabbit.
Nevertheless, she never stops pursuing her dream to become a police
officer in Zootopia. Because she wants to make the world a better
place. Dreams are what all people must have, and they must be good
ones, too. And by good I mean a dream that will make the world a better
place. On her job, she uncovers a plot against the peace of Zootopia
and must solve the mystery, with a shady character.A whole new world can be used to describe Zootopia because of it's
bright, colorful, breathtaking sceneries of Nature and a thriving,
civilized city inhabited by animals, where humans do not exist. But
these animals that inhabit the urban jungle of Zootopia have been
anthropomorphized. In other words, these animals have human
characteristics. Here is a place where animals, be it predators or
preys, get along together. Modern day Zootopia is where this film is
set, in which their ancestors have already put aside their differences
and learned to get along. Here is a film that talks about animals
getting along together. If animals can put aside their differences and
live together in peace in harmony, why can't we humans do the same?!The movie stresses (some) strong and positive role models, especially
the main characters. But also there are the appearance of crime bosses
and shady criminal characters. Certain (roughly considered) adult jokes
may be also present in the film. Yet these minor adult moments cannot
even slightly mar the positive messages about acceptance, peace and
harmony, determination, responsibility, respecting one another in spite
of their differences and so many more that I still haven't finished
analyzing. As always, it is always the good things that will triumph
over the bad. Come on, chant it: "Good will Trimph!!" See the film for
yourself and you will understand what I mean. Me? As a vegetarian and an animal lover myself, the impact of the film
upon me was of an extreme proportion. I have no clue of the experience
that the film was about to give me when I walked into the movie
theater, and the way to describe it, was a transcendent experience.
Irresistible comedy, strong, positive messages about acceptance and
peace, you name it. It is there. And like many of Disney's films, they
entertain and educate their audiences.More to talk about the film, I cannot finish here. The film has taught
me to respect animals even more. To all audiences out there, go see the
film with a few precautions in mind, and you will most certainly be
influenced by it and grow new respect for animals and other living
beings as well (Hey, we humans are animals too aren't we?!). Meanwhile,
for animal lovers, the impact of the film would be even stronger. Try
it, you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll embrace the adventure and themes,
and finally, have a lot of fun. So now you know, Zootopia. Like nothing
you've seen be-fur? Yes, it is.

I just came home from seeing Zootopia, and guess what? It's great. In
my opinion, it's better than Big Hero 6. Zootopia mixes up a laugh-out-loud comedy with a detective story with
some serious scenes, and the result is just fine. There are times where
I got distracted by a scene, in particular, where past Disney movies
were spoofed as a pirated Blu-Ray, or another one, the sloth scene we
saw in the trailer. It's a detective story about searching a missing
otter and why he went savage en route plus who is behind this. Please take note that there are some scenes that are not that
kid-friendly (i.e, turning animals into savage by guns, fooling
somebody just for the money, a panther with a scratched eye, a fox
scratches a young Judy Hopps and her wound is seen, discouraging
someone that she can't be what she dreams to be, parents laughing at
Judy Hopps for being a parking guard and not a real cop, a naturalist
resort with nude animals, etc.) which explains why it is rated PG-13
locally (in my country).The voice acting was well-done! Jason Bateman and Giniffer Goodwin fit
in their roles. While I had really high hopes for Michael Giacchino's
score, I thought it was just okay, but that wouldn't undo my high
rating. The puns and spoofs are what make this movie really hilarious
(Carrot/Apple, Rangled, Pig Hero 6, Meowna based on Disney's upcoming
flick 'Moana', Wreck-It Rhino, Targoat, etc.). Zootopia is not your usual comedy film. It actually has a story that is
really entertaining, memorable dialogue and comedic scenes,
well-developed characters with realistic emotions, a well-done design
for the city Zootopia, and a strong message for both kids and adults
alike about prejudice that is explained clearly. This is the best
Disney movie (still not better than Pixar's films, but it is in their
level) so far!10/10

An excellent film overall. Disney! you have done it again. The
interplay between Judy (Hops) the rabbit and Nick the fox was simply a
joy to watch, on how they outwitted each other. Next, the comedic
elements had 80% of my cinema goers laughing, especially with the
sloth, who steals the show! Finally, the values taught are very real in
our society, that of discrimination, resilience and going the extra
mile. This is what sets animation apart from other more adult films.
Overall, I give this an 8/10! excellent, excellent film! On another note, I do have a youtube review of this if you search '3
reasons to watch zootopia' by the Mrfoo. Am just starting out reviewing
movies so would really appreciate your support! Many thanks!

Tangled, Wreck it Ralph and now Zootopia. It looks like Disney
Animation is quickly becoming a pool of great movies. I came out of
this one with a smile that covered my whole face and I still find hard
to shake it off, this movie blew me away in excitement, fun but most of
all heart.One cannot start to talk about Zootopia without mentioning some of the
best world building of recent years. other than being animated to
perfection, this film is alive, it is engaging even in its background
and other than being intelligently thought out, it tells a story only
with its world. Be it comedy or social commentary, I just wished
multiple times I could put it pause the film or instantly rewatch a
scene to absorb everything that was going on. This is a further example
of the truly excellent, intelligent visual storytelling animated films
are excelling at, especially recently and I remember clearly having a
moment in the film in which I was effortlessly happy for cinema and its
future, because this was the living proof of correctly using new
mediums and technologies to tell a story.And I haven't even started yet talking about the characters of
Zootopia. As I was watching the film I thought to myself that these
were going to become staples of the genre, that's how good they are.
The chemistry between the two main characters is unbelievable and their
arch is riveting to watch at every moment, with a fantastic pay off.
This film is so well written: be it the running gags, the pop culture
references which never end and never miss, the character development,
the storytelling, the themes incorporated seamlessly, the emotional
connection, the perfect handling of secondary characters, the
hilarious, laugh out loud comedic moments, I hope I am not missing
anything, all of these were part of screenplay that I am sure I will
revisit and study joyfully. I can't believe how much I fell in love
with this world and its characters and only now I realized how
entertained I was with them, not to mention how absorbing the story
proved to be.The film does have its false steps, but none of them really mattered to
me. The introduction is somewhat off beat and uneven with the rest,
there are a little too many coincidences and whilst the characters are
thankfully in danger many times, they are as many times handed a
solution to problems which makes things a little too easy for them at
times, yet fortunately the film does integrate these very organically
to the point were you roll along, without even thinking about it.I wished this film would not end, that's how much fun I was having with
it, this is a very recommended watch in the theater, where possibly
adults are going to have more fun than kids. Can't wait to check this
out again.

Walt Disney studios has been anthropomorphizing animals since before
any of us were born, and it goes to show that they picked up a couple
of tricks along the way. What an amazing world they have created for
this movie, with tons of great details both in the forefront and in the
background. Some jokes were obvious, while some I'm sure go over the
head of the mostly young audience that will see this movie. The
different parts of the city, how the animals live together despite
physical differences, all of it is a delight to watch. And it's
rendered beautifully.There are some parts of this movie that I'm not that big a fan of. The
visual style of this movie is nice, but it's also very similar to what
we have seen before. In Frozen, Tangled and this, we see Disney turning
the style used in their traditional animation movies being converted
into these computer generated styles. Maybe it is because other studios
has also taken inspiration from Disney's old movies, but the animals in
this movie mostly look very similar to what we have seen before in
Dreamworks movies, for instance. While it was all still beautiful, the
characters all felt like (really nice) "stock CGI-models".The ending was a bit of a let down too. It's as "noir" as the rest of
the movie, but underwhelming. Most likely because they did not want to
go "darker", as this is a Disney-movie. Obviously we can't expect it to
go as far as "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", but a bit more would have
helped.All in all, it's a really fun movie that everyone can enjoy. I saw this
in a "surpise screening" at the local art cinema (with a room full of
cinephiles), and everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot. Despite there not
being a single child in attendance. People were laughing and crying,
jumping in their seats and going "aww". Disney knows their stuff.

Went to see this movie with my girlfriend yesterday. We saw the trailer
and had high hopes for it, and boy did it deliver.The characters are well thought through and the visuals are beautiful.
The whole idea behind this movie is great. It doesn't involve any human
characters, just animals that all walk on two feet and live their lives
like humans would. Disney has created a whole new world where everyone
has a job and does its daily activities.Of course there's a deeper moral to the story like any other Disney
movie. To see how it all works out, I'd say just check it out, you'll
like it.

I've always admired the Disney films, from the very first of Snow white
and the seven dwarfs to their latest instalment of Zootopia. It has a
red thread, a theme and vibrant humour throughout the entire film, and
it keeps on those values from start to finish.Judy Hopps is a bunny with dreams, big dreams, as she's a bunny with
the dreams of becoming an officer, which no bunny has ever been.
Despite everyone's attempts of keeping her from it, she goes through
it. As an officer, she's looked down at, until she lands her first
case, and inadvertently her first "partner" in the sly fox Nick Wilde.
And together the unlikely partners (despite the fox' will) starts
pulling the strings together of the mysterious case of the missing
animals of Zootopia.The story isn't sophisticated, but then again, no story from Disney is.
This isn't "The usual suspects" or "Lucky number slevin", but it is a
good story and there are some strong themes around prejudice and
reaching for your dreams, regardless of what others say. The animations
are superb as always, the music lively and the soundscape amazing. The
details are good as well, from the long delivery tube to get the coffee
delivered to the giraffe to the entire city block dedicated to rodents,
there are details all over the place. The creators went to great
lengths to make sure Zootopia as a diverse city, stood out as one. I
can highly recommend this film to kids and adults alike. If you're a
fan of Disney films - like me - then this film isn't a disappointment,
and delivers that Disney magic that we've all come to love from over 70
years of their works.

So, i just saw Zootopia, i was waiting for the movie for three and a
half weeks, last year i did not think to much of it until i saw just
one, new trailer and i loved it from then. The movie is about a Bunny
Cop that has to prove that smaller animals can do anything like a
bigger one can . In Zootopia both predators and non predators live
together in harmony. And Zootopia is not the only place, there is a
hole world with different regions, landscape, each individual animal
lives in its respective area as in our world, and some mixed. But the
art and animation is great! The level of detail is stunning and is
probably the best looking animated movie ever made, well it is Disney
so it is expected. But The main character Judy hopps and Nick Wilde,
are both great character and they have perfect chemistry between them,
even tho they are animals they feel so real and this world is so real,
it is almost as you can envision yourself living there, i mean Judys
phone is basically an Iphone, no mistake. But the story is that she
needs to solve a case and she has only 48 hours to do so, why 48 and
why she has to do it i will not spoil since it is such a big part of
the movie,I'm writing this very tired so it is not the best review, and
sorry for spelling I'm Swedish, but yhea, great animation, great
characters great art, great story, great everything, great drama and
there are some really good dramatic scenes, the animation enhance the
emotions we see threw the characters so that is a big plus, and for me,
this movie is more of a family and not just for kids, heck i would not
even rate this pg7, if there existed 10 i would put it at that, this
movies is very mature and adults and teenagers will appreciate that. I
myself am 17 years old, and went with my sister who is 19, and in the
theather there were kids, adults and teenagers, id still only take kids
around 9 to 10 and above, since it is a crime drama i don't think
younger kids will find it interesting or will understand what is going
on. It also have a plentiful of funny scenes that will make most people
laugh, and what happened after the credits, people where clapping, that
has never happened to me ever before with a movie, so yhea, Go see it,
it is just fantastic and I'm probably going to see it again this week!
It is my favorite animated Disney movie ever, when i say animated i
mean 3d, you know frozen, wreck it Ralph etc. SEE IT! EDIT: Seen it
three times now.

Zootopia is about ambitious bunny Judy Hopps, a rookie cop assigned an
impossible case, and a fox street hustler named Nick Wild. The two form
an unlikely friendship working the case together. More and more animals
have gone missing in Zootropolis and it is up Judy and her unlikely
partner, Nick the fox, to track them down in 48 hours.This movie has something for folks of all ages, obviously it appeals to
kids, but it is also stock full of sly hints and references just for
the grown ups(although there is a particularly clever Frozen reference
in there that the kids might get). It is just gorgeous animation and the attention to detail is
astonishing (like in the corner of Judys phone the carrier is "PB&J").
Overall it is a fine movie, you can bring the kids to it (or they can
bring you to it) but you will most certainly still get a lot out of it
anyway. And the song really catchy.

Zootopia stars Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jason Bateman, and its about a
bunny that is trying to be a real cop, and in that process she meets a
fox and they have to team up for kind of a investigation that is going
on. I have liked wreck it Ralph and Big Hero 6 in the past, not really
that much for Frozen. I liked a lot of things on this movie, but it is
a very normal film for children. When we first ever look at Zootopia,
it looks great. There is clearly a lot of creativity behind it, but
there is not enough of that creativity here. The two main actors did
fine on their job, but i think they would be played by other actors.
The plot is sometimes riveting, but you know what is going to happen at
the end. I will say that I laughed a lot in a scene involving sloths
that i will not spoil you have to see it yourself. But other than that,
I really did not laugh that much in the movie, some of the jokes really
fall flat. Also there is a clichÃ© of where friends get mad at each
other, and there is lot of moping and doping. It is just time consuming
as you know they are going to get back together, so there is no point
to it. Overall, i think kids would have a good time with this movie,
and it is a good movie, but i think Disney can make better
entertainment for both adults and children. 7.5/10

After the success of Frozen and Big Heroes 6, Disney continues to
improve by upgrading its animation quality not only in terms of story
and effects, but surprisingly on originality, delivering messages and a
sense of maturity. Setting up in a city occupied by all types of
animals, it manipulates the relationship of predators and preys as a
metaphor to emphasis the current society's biases phenomenon rather
than the usual family relationship issues audiences usually seen in
previous animated films. Being a funny and adventurous simple tale, the
structural progression of the story is not the usual straightforward
style that is kid friendly but mostly due to its thrilling elements
that lead to twisted plots which is quite rare in animations. Scores
composed by Michael Giacchino and theme song "Try Everything" by
Shakira perfectly fit while the ingenious landscapes of metropolitan
city and mother nature definitely serve as splendid visual treats. It
is undeniable smart and classic, strong like a bull to stress on the
existence of prejudice and peace, only if we learn to respect each
others from different races, backgrounds and cultures.

There is a few times were a movie comes out and i can give it a 10/10
(favourite) rating without having to watch it a second time. But this
picture was far too great for me not to score 10/10.Zootopia follows our bunny protagonist Juddy Hopps in her quest for
justice, honesty and most of all achieving her dream of becoming a cop,
impossible as it may seem due to her size, against all odds and
constant warnings from others. As a cop she will meet Nick Wilde, a sly
fox con artist that will help her uncover some conspiracy that could
potentially ruin relationships between prey and predators.This movie is as smart as a anthropomorphic animal film can be taking
advantage of every quality of the animal kingdom (for example the
districts of the city Zootopia are ecosystems) while also making some
references to pop culture and clever writing. The voice acting is top
notch and the animation is by far one of the best out there, with
impressive lighting effects and character facial expressions. But the
best element of this film is its two main characters and the chemistry
between them...yes there is just as much chemistry between Juddy and
Nick as there is between Danny Golver and Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon.I fell in love with this movie and i cant wait to see it again. If you
are into animation definitely give this a try, it has plenty of adult
humor and kids will find the animated characters just riveting. To name
some possible flaws the movie might fall into some clichÃ©s throughout
and is predictable, but the writing, characters and animation is so
good i don't think it matters that much. Also the 3d is fine but not
really necessary.

Out of "Zootopia" comes one of Disney's cleverest scripts, for the fact
it successfully pulls off a new spin on their usual fables. Well, the
concept isn't new Â– an animal buddy cop movie, but in usual Disney
animated magic, it is a fun new creation. At the center of this buddy
cop movie is bunny Judy Hopps (a wonderful Ginnifer Goodwin), an
aspiring cadet who is landed on parking duty, despite being a
valedictorian in police academy. But when given a chance to solve a
case, she recruits fox con artist Nick Wilde (a smooth-talking Jason
Bateman in perfect voice acting mode) to crack it. Yes, one can see the
obvious direction this goes. But surprisingly, "Zootopia" greatly pulls
off the clichÃ©s with an abundant dose of Disney Animation Studio's
colorful animation (from the creative Zootopia districts to its 3D
effects) and its surprising script that, to be honest, contained one of
Disney's more adult-oriented dialogue. Secretly, every line and frame
is littered with self-referential humor that mostly adults will relate
to. (That explains my country's PG-13 rating.) Aside from mature humor,
its surprising detour to teach about prejudice is a timely subject. And
thankfully, it was not handled with a smack in the gut. All around,
"Zootopia" may not stick out as a classic, but can rest in our
subconscious as one fun, wild ride. So, sticking out for more fun
adventures with Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde!

I disagree with Sean Phillips and Tako Yaki. This is a great movie. I
couldn't just watch it once. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who
hasn't seen it but I would definitely recommend it to both young and
older audiences. I noticed while watching it that Apple is advertised
in it as well, so that it can feel more contemporary with the present
as Disney done in quite a few films, including Oliver and Company. The
animation is smoothly done and beautiful, and the story itself gives a
really positive message to children of all ages. This is the best movie
I've seen in a long time, and I have recommended it to almost everyone
I've talked to. It's heartwarming. Even though the movie is almost two
hours long, it goes by very smoothly, and the story itself is new, not
retold as some are. Of course the characters do have their very own
characteristics and such, and the concept of life with just animals is
interesting as well. It reflects bullying, being told what you can and
can't do, motivation, encouragement, racism, and bullying, and is
relatable. I love this movie!

Welcome to the anthropomorphic world of Zootopia! Created by Rich Moore

First off let me start by simply saying this was by far the best movie
I've seen in years hands down! Sorry Star Wars, but my heart rests with
this film!So what's to say? Well for starters the detail is simply amazing! There
were honestly so many things going on I simply wasn't able to catch
every single thing and trust me there is a lot! The scenery and
characters are just so organic and the attention to even the most
smallest of detail was incredible!As for the characters (I'll try to keep this spoiler free from here on
out but I will add one little thing right at the end. Warning will be
given beforehand!) So... The characters are all done perfectly, even
the villains are hard not to like! Both main characters were very
relatable and each face something special to the story. I found myself
at times loving Judies kindhearted optimistic nature although I'm a bit
more like Nick with his more worldly look on life and the small we get
to see of his back story is both sad and tragic and is something that
still haunts him as an adult. Nick is funny, very funny! And a bit
sarcastic at times and although he's not the overly
emotional/affectionate type but he does have a heart and he does show
it in his own way when the time comes! From what I know of Ginnifer
Goodwin and Jason Bateman the personalities of Judy and Nick fit the
real life counterparts perfectly!Story wise Zootopia is first and foremost a story of being true to ones
self! But also just importantly it's a story of over coming perceived
prejudice. Zootopia does a very good job and displaying what could be
easily understood as bigoted attitudes concerning race, gender, or even
sexuality without ever being preachy about it. It also shows rather
bluntly that not all stereotypes are completely untrue! The film does
have a message however, a very positive one! It's simply be good to one
another. We're all in this together.I've seen a whole lot of people bring this up and even more art of it
so this might upset a few! Judy and Nick are not a romantic couple!
They are and do however become very close friends that do love and care
a lot about one another! I find that sometimes a close friendship like
this is every bit if not even more important as being in a
relationship.All in all Zootopia is a must see! Young or old! You'll laugh (a lot)
and might even tear up just a bit. But by the end I'm certain you'll
have a huge smile on your face! When this comes out state side in about
two weeks from the date of this journal post GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Trust
me as someone who doesn't go out very often this was worth every penny
of what I paid! You'll not be disappointed. This is no Chicken Little
folks!My only negative point is I wish they would of given Nick more story. I
was left with many questions that were left unanswered like why he was
homeless. Also it should of been noted that Nick is also a vegetarian,
it hinted to this but never really said such.

I am simply dying for this movie. It is coming out in march 4. I saw
lots of sneak peeks though. I went to Disney animation studios and got
previews. It is so sad when Judy and Nick argue and Judy apologizes.
108 minutes is a long time. In Nick backstory, his mother could not
afford his boy scout outfit. He was harshly bullied by the prey
animals. I will not spoil the ending.Judy's play was hilarious. She pretended she was dead and overplayed
it. Her parents were not enthusiastic but the others were. Gideon Grey
was so nice in the climax. Note: Watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!

Well, as always, critics and people will love this movie, cause it's
Disney!(which I deeply love). In reality it's because there haven't
been great animated movies in a decade and people are not even noticing
how much the standard level is more and more lowering(except Tangled
and Toy Story 3, the others were good ideas, with cheap, bland and
boring results).GRAPHICS: Once again, we have an animated movie that try to reach even
more graphical perfection: the world is wonderfully detailed but its
pretty clear that every character of every movie created in CG will
look the same. The way they move, the eyes, the facial expressions, are
so graphically realistic and at the same time done with exaggerated
animated acting, that it's always like watching bad mimes who are
playing a part. Rating: 9\10 for the world, 3\10 for the characters(and
that's almost the maximum for CGI).CHARACTERS: The fact that Disney can't create great characters anymore
is depressing. The characters are boring once again; they are just
created to give the most banal and predictable comedy one can watch on
a TV sit-com. That's exactly the kind of humor in animation and comedy
movies by now. Or even more easy: "Look! an hamster who moves like an
hamster! funny!". The fact that an animal has its animal
characteristics is the minimum I expect from Disney animation, and even
more in the aesthetic normality of the world Zootopia, not treated as a
joke. Or even worse, all the pop-culture references, cause they are
funny! Ratings: 4\10STORY: The story is kind of good, with a dark tone, and somewhat
interesting, but again, the characters are so bland in their
predictable personality that I didn't managed to care very much. The
point is that, in great artists hand, this could have been a nice
movie. Ratings: 6\10And then we got the today moral lesson. That's not a fault for this
movie to be honest, because it seems every animated movie must have a
moral. And I still don't understand why . Animated movies are an
aesthetic art, just like another movie, and not an educational lesson.
It's because adults are so dumb nowadays(I'm sorry, but we all know
that) that think if something is not educational is not for children. I
have an information for you: children are smarter than adults, and they
need to be treated as such. Disney, please, don't waste too much time coming up with lessons and a
movie created around it, give us some GREAT CHARACTERS AND STORIES like
you used to do, and the great lessons of life would come along.FINAL RATINGS: My vote is 5 on a total scale(of all time), and a 7 in
the last ten years scale; but the whole feeling of the movie (the
characters, the humor, the dynamics) is always the same of every recent
animated movie, so I lower it to 2(since I know everybody will give it
10\10).

The actual Disney films didn't save The company to me. Frozen despite
being a blockbuster, I did not like. Big Hero 6 unsaved much. Zootopia
definitely safe. This is The frist time i actually like for complete.
They don't have The story of The Parents are dead, they don't have a
Script clichÃ©, They don't have ALL The Movie song in every minute, its
Just a great film. The idea of a City of Animals sounds silly But what
they do of this they have very clear ideas. The characters are
fantastic, The Animation is fantastic, The Script is fantastic. Is
weird but is The frist time i See a great Disney film and Not a clichÃ©
Disney film. I wasn't expecting i Was going to like this film. Zootopia
is a very Good film who they have a Good entrentening for Adults and
Kids.

First thing's first: Yes I know a lot of Furries were excited for this
film, claiming they FINALLY got a film dedicated to furries! Except,
their are PLENTY of other furry films out there, like Rock N Rule,
Fritz The Cat, and Meet The Feebles to name a few. But I guess cause
it's Disney it gets a free-pass? Anyway, onto the review: This is
one,if not THE, worst films of 2016 and probably one of Disney's worst.
It's main issue is that we seen this type of story done before and done
better in countless of other movies (But as always, whenever Disney
does it, they get a free pass). It's basic premise is that Judy Hops is
the first rabbit to join the Police force but must join forces with a
well-known con named Nick, a fox (haha I get it cause Foxes are known
to be sneaky...wasn't that used before?) to uncover a sinister plot
involving certain citizens of Zootopia reverting back to their
predatory status and *SPOILERS* they find out that it was all the work
of Deputy Mayor Bellwether. To put it in simpler terms: This is a movie
about both Racism and SJWs. The characters are boring to the point of
being predictable. Heck, most of the characters advertised are only
there for only a joke or as a background character. As for the villain
behind the plot, they're a SJW character and they want the world to
fear predators like they used to...ANOTHER element we seen before. As
for the animation, it's Disney, you'd expect great animation from them
and here it's once again great. But that is the only positive I'll give
it. The little attention to details are amazing at times and the way
each animal is animated is clever and unique, Now, one scene in
particular made me go and ask "WHY did Disney put this in the film?!"
and it's one of the heavily advertised scenes. Said scene being the
music scene with Shakira's character. Why do I have a problem with this
scene? Well, the way the tiger characters are dressed and the way they
are dancing, it is pretty much male strippers dancing. Disney...this is
a film for FAMILIES so WHY did you put male strippers in the film?! You
know, I wanted to like this film cause I thought Disney was doing
something unique and different, but I can not bring myself to neither
liking this film nor recommending it to anyone. If you want a furry
film done right AND is creative and unique, watch either Fritz The Cat,
Rock N Rule, or Meet The Feebles, If you want a MUST- SEE film in
theaters, go and see Deadpool for a 20th time or save your cash for Ice
Age: Collision Course, Warcraft, or any of the other films coming out
this year. Even if you take the furry element out of this movie, this
is still one of the worst films I've seen. Sorry, Disney, but this is
the worst film of 2016 and one of your worst films in a while.And just a quick edit: Really Disney?! A Breaking Bad reference? IN A
FAMILY FILM!? WHAT CHILD WATCHES BREAKING BAD?!

There was not even one funny content, sloppy dialogs, and the story
totally flat. I doubt it was a comedy. I wouldn't suggest it for
children, as the plot is hardly understandable even adults. By
understandable I mean exciting. This movie just happened. No memories
left. No magic left. It's hard to write anything cause the movie was
empty. Disappointing. I love Lion the King, Tangled, WALL-E, Hercules,
but this movie is a disgrace! It is full of humor for adults, crappy
humor by the way. Children sitting behind me asked their father: "Can
we go home, please", and it was just 30 minutes of movie. They started
asking repeatedly after one hour. I totally agreed with them. I wanted
to go home and watch Lion the King. I wanted my evening back. Nice
marketing Disney! Sadly. You won't catch me again. Is it the end of
animation for children and people with young hearts?

Disney does not make movies for children anymore. They make movies for
adults now with some of the most repulsive undertones in them (such as
into the woods, for example). This movie is embarrassing and
unnecessarily crude. Disney is starting to make animated films that are
not appropriate for children. The whole "nudist" thing was disgusting.
For your information Disney I have the right to judge whoever I want,
and that includes people who think it is okay to run around naked. I
will not be taking my children to this insulting adult film. It's
amazing how far Disney has fallen. The cartoon Robin Hood from 1973 was
a story about furies and it was perfectly decent, but this film is just
awful. Sure the animation is great, some of the characters are cute and
humorous, but as far as the story goes it is rehashed from several
things, including the Godfather. I'm tired of Disney making their
animated films for adults and not children. This movie, along with The
Good Dinosaur, are just the animation flops this year. I can't
understand why Disney has such trouble making good animated films
(Inside Out was good but the other Disney animations this year were
terrible). Stop trying to be a world politician Disney, by forcing your
opinions on everyone else and attempting to brainwash children by
placing these opinions in movies that are supposed to be for children.
I can only hope that the live-action Jungle Book and Finding Dory and
Moana will be better, but I seriously doubt they will.If you like furies then you might have fun with this film, but
seriously I thought the movie was overly crude.
