I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening for this film. I had a
toss up between two films to see and I chose this one based on the
trailer and generally positive reviews (who likes to waste their time
with bad movies). Wow.This is one of those rare feats in filmmaking. The cinematography is
great, but see this for the acting and the story. Not often has a movie
made me cry, laugh, and shout out (aloud mind you) during the films run
time. I don't want to spoil much of the story as it becomes obvious
early on, what is actually going on. The magnificence of this film is
in how the director was able to tackle the difficult subject matter in
a way that doesn't leave you feeling like you saw an average
thriller/horror movie, but really out it in perspective of the child,
which I believe had a humanistic approach. It was amazing. Best movie
of 2015, by a long shot and they're were great movies this year. (Im
looking at you exmachina) Not only I, but I feel absolutely everyone who left the theater left a
better person for what they witnessed. Not often do I come out of the
theater with people being more polite than they were upon entering.
THAT is the power this movie has, I emerged myself in the experience
and I'm glad I did, because "No one is strong alone", certainly not I,
and I have a more profound idea of appreciation of my own life and
existence til death. I will continue on my quest but I know that I will
never forget this landmark film, what it taught me, and how it humbled
everyone in the theater.

At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film "ROOM" won the
People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her
five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and
windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her
son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that
you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how
Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle
and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young
Jack but how?The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee
Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake
Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted
from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and
she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in
a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of
Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro.
This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015.
It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over
10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the
girls were to their own homes and families.The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life
outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six
years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as
Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing
all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa. There are some scenes
that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself
becoming emotionally involved. In one particular scene Jack asks his
Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that
his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick
Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is
initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his
Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This
scene will stay with me forever. Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope
and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room
is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in
a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and
best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. This film is
terrific!!

Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the
word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the
film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has
adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film
so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion
thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks
and surprise at every turn.Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, Room introduces us to Ma and Jack,
a mother and son held captive in a garden shed. As we learn more about
their captivity, their world becomes clearer and clearer to us. They
live by a routine, have names for every object in room, and Ma must be
careful as her son grows older and more curious.The film is structured into two halves, and by now it's no spoiler that
the second half deals with their readjustment into the outside world,
and Jack's first time outside of room. The film is thematically
complex, yet never overwhelming. At its core it's about motherhood, but
Jack's unique upbringing complicates things.Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room
he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the
abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their
bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's
close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept
filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a
new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes.
The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's
genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he
adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie
never loses sight of that.I wrote about the pressure placed on child actors in my review for the
incredible Beasts of No Nation, and Jacob Tremblay fits like a glove.
Like Abraham Attah, he isn't a child actor, but an actor who just
happens to be of a younger age. His wide eyes and expressive thoughts
are very believable, and when he sees the outside world for the first
time, it's a thing of beauty. Tremblay has brilliant chemistry with
Brie Larson, and for one second I never doubted her devotion to him. As
Ma faces frustrating upon leaving room, from her parents, doctors, and
the media, she never forgets her son Jack, and always puts his
wellbeing first. Larson taps into this character, one that undergoes a
stunning transformation as she basically lost seven years of her life
being locked up. Her performance will blow you away.The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their
characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they
happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous
range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not
just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson
goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography
Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we
view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured
upbringing. The result is a breathtaking experience brought to life,
one you won't soon forget.

I know one thing, I will never, ever forget this heartrending,
unbelievably-acted 'movie' for the rest of my days. I'm just at a loss
for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and
heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you
don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or
while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson)
and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The
beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally
relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep,
deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears;
sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It
made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had
my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was
witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and
one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read
much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely
catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved
(in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the
best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')

Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay
as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother ("Ma")The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother
are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated
her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived
in a small, locked shed, which they call "Room." Jack's mother has
lived in "Room" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has
lived there for all of his life--five years.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from
realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that
anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe
that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept
it.What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because
it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic,
frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has
to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant.
Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such
great performances from his actors.This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room
wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped
men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the
lives of those women without becoming depressed. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given
the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small
screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally
before you begin.

*Insert all 9 & 10 reviews here* I was in awe during the entire film.
Lenny Abrahamson & the writing team made sure there was not one dull
moment. The addition of "insignificant" characters and plot twists are
later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film
alive throughout it's duration. It was the little things that made this
story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire
palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of
curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to
influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most
beautiful way.

Don't listen to the haters or those that want to chip away at the
overall brilliance of 'Room'. What film doesn't have small flaws, they
pale into insignificance during the 2 hours of continuous emotional
maelstrom that follows. This film wrings every last drop of emotion and
drama out of the allotted playtime. Make no mistake, despite short
bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and
doesn't let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or
less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a
first rate drama with stand out performances all round. Especially from
the child protagonist. **Warning** If you have trouble viewing emotionally charged material of
a sensitive nature about abuse. You would be well advised not to view
this film.

Lenny Abrahamson's Room opens in a 10 x 10 room that has no windows, a
locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead
skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair
down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life,
saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass
outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to
the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the
plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with
some pleasure.Not that he lacks for companionship. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and
their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where
Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend.
All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old
Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he
comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight. Ma, we find out,
has been kept prisoner and used for sex by the hulking man who comes
every night and we know that Jack is a result of his mother's rape.
Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of
view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into
his mother's mind and feel her pain and live her dreams.There is never any doubt of his mother's love though the obvious strain
of keeping herself from crying out every minute is painfully obvious.
To Jack, she is the center of his world and his reason for being. When
the second half of the film takes a surprising turn and shifts 180
degrees, Jack and Ma are not prepared for what awaits them. Even when
an alternative is suggested as possible, he doesn't want to hear
anything about a different world with blue sky and rivers and trees.
Room is a tense and compelling film in which Brie Larson more than
fulfills the brilliance that she showed in Short Term 12 and should
make her an Oscar contender. Tremblay is also superb.He lives his character and makes him come alive, even though he is only
nine years old. Supporting roles by Joan Allen and William H. Macy also
contribute to the film's second half but it is always Larson and
Tremblay that carry the day. The film is not mawkish or sentimental
even though the soaring score by Stephen Rennicks comes close. While
there are has some plot implausibilities, the film is a tribute to the
resiliency and the dedicated love of a parent for their child. It is
also a teaching experience. Like many who are walled off from each
other and think the box they are in is all there is, the film can give
us the combination to open the locked door, if we take the risk to turn
the key.

Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a
challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But
that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the
film's hefty nature.'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from
the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy
makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good
people. But its also about hope & fighting back. Its shocking to see
the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave
mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed & often
disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son & mother escape.
The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke
down.'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is
consistently powerful & the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny
Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic,
unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly
claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.Performance-Wise: Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible
performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave
protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance.
The child does wonders & makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting
cast, Joan Allen & The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its
power is undeniable.

Too many tears, too much sadness. Story of a teenager Ma kidnapped,
raped and made a mom. And mom and son Jack locked in a room away from
the world. Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be
4. Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the
arms of his only friend his own mother. He wants to be breast fed , he
wants to shower with his Ma. He enjoys the only place he knows for his
first 5 yrs of his life. There is no chaos from the real person he
knows. Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room. Life outside the
room has its' own problems of tears, cries, fights.Excellent writing by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the
screenplay. Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother Ma are
terrific. Every scene, every dialogue has sincerity. Oscar worthy
screenplay. Oscar worthy acting . Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's
grandma is perfect grandma, loving, caring, sensitive and excellent.
Definite Oscar nominees. Jacob Tremblay , so young and so perfect in
every scene.

Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th
birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a
visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be
perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a
confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of
escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for
sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that
perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably)
unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond
his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the
things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal.
Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? And that's where I'll leave this synopsis, since (if you've been lucky
enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to
unfurl here.This is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some
truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and
director (Irishman Lenny "Frank" Abrahamson) are to be commended in
keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined.
Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the 'evil kidnapper', is not painted as some
predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some
warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven
years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.The film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay)
but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in
trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her
with her school friends she bitterly comments that "Nothing happened to
them - - they just got on with their lives".The acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for
the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your
vote here
http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not
that Boyega isn't great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here.
She obviously won't give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And
for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as
one of this year's weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also
exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare
young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a
special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there
was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a
child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two
core performances lock in your belief in the story.Supporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy's
mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the "Bourne"
films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the
kidnapper.At 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my
attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and
marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true 'teaser
trailer' this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting
trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether
its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but
whoever it is they should be taken out and 'given a good talking to'
for this travesty. It's like putting all of the twists in films like
"The Crying Game", "The Sixth Sense" and "Gone Girl" in their
respective trailers. I've gone so far as to create my own One Mann's
Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have
included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.A leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of "Die
Hard" or "Fast and Furious" fans. But for everyone else, this should be
a must see.Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this

I usually trust RottenTomatoes and IMDb ratings, and while I might
watch something that gets a 60% rating or above if the subject
interests me, I will usually fall in line with the critics and
reviewers on any movie that gets a 97% on RT or such high scores on
IMDb. Well, this movie completely shattered my entire belief system, to
the point where I find myself without a guiding light for the future.Many better worded reviews on this site have already captured the
grievances that I had with this film, but I must write mine out so that
I can feel better and move on with my life...It felt like it was 3 hours long. In an unbelievable feat of
cinematography, they managed to stretch time so that a 2 hour movie
felt like 3. The could have condensed the film into an hour and 20
minutes and I would felt less cheated. Outside of a short plot line,
*nothing* happened. And every single thread that could have been
interesting to develop was cut short leaving us unsatisfied and
wondering. It's a movie about nothing. There was no great insight into the human
cause or suffering, no great insight into the psyche of the captor, no
details on the parental breakup, no real role given to the very
interesting characters of the girl's real father or her mom's new
husband. The girl was a b*tch (I mean, that's forgivable given the
circumstances), but outside of sympathy for her, it was not
entertaining to connect with her on any level. And every single time
anything got interesting in the movie the scene ended.The real life is a lot scarier and way more touching than this movie,
and unless one lives in a room, turning on the news every day brings a
lot more real emotion and watching a poorly constructed movie with a
very minimal depth is not that touching. What can we learn from a 5
year old and his view on the world? That could be interesting to see,
sure, but even here, the monologues were short and infantile (because
what would you expect from a 5 year old?) Jack was no great thinker at
a young age. Yes, the world is full of wonder on the outside, whether
you're 5 or 85.Perhaps it was a movie for those whose view on life has gotten so
complacent that they lost any sense of that wonderment and listening to
an annoying 5 year old describe his first experiences in the real world
outside of his room brought them to tears because of nostalgia or
remembering their own childhood innocence. Clearly, I am one of the few
against the world who Loved this movie, so I'll be the first to admit
defeat.Now, however, I'm left to scratch my head and re-evaluate my
relationship with movie reviews.

It's hard to get revenge on a bad movie. I am partially consoled
considering I snuck into this theater rather than paying for a ticket.
Still, this subversion robbed me of the cathartic argument over my
refund with some hapless manager. Room stole two hours of my life, and
the only way I am going to get value from that experience is to get the
last word. Room has an extremely fertile premise. An unnamed woman (Brie Larson)
has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for seven years, five of
which she has spent raising her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). I am unaware
how the book navigated this premise, but author and screenwriter Emma
Donoghue had a bottomless potential of directions and selected none.
The writing is too shallow to be a thought experiment on trauma or a
character study. The narrative is too muddled by loose ends to be a
simple "feel good" movie. Cult classic The Room had a similar degree of
cohesion yeah okay no it didn't. Poor contractually obligated jokes
aside, Room is simply aimless. This child grows up in a 10x10 room
surrounded by sexual abuse his entire life and his lone complications
are a paleness, shyness, and poor grammar. I have met children with
comparable behavior from normal households. Children might be plastic,
but no one is going to manage a full swift recovery from being born
into this environment. The mother character is better explored, but
barely. The strength of this woman while kidnapped is unbelievable, but
interesting questions are raised after the escape. Her relationship
with her parents, her friends, and dealing with new realties are all
introduced and either dropped or solved off screen. This is a device
derived from the book where everything is seen through Jack's
perspective. But post-escape Jack is just cute and boring, not worth
following. His narration of events is insufferable. The conclusion of
Room is sickening. The film has the audacity to propose that mother and
son will be able to leave this experience behind in the closing
moments. This claim is beyond ignorant and well into insulting.For the sake of critical fairness I will mention all the two and a half
things I enjoyed. The escape sequence is genuinely thrilling. Putting a
child in peril is often a cheap way to manipulate the audience. It
worked here, so credit is due. Second, the cinematography in the room
itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more
claustrophobic. Instead, the dimensions are simply defined and
unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to
wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This
place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the
room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. The one
victory achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect
perspective when the room is seen from the outside. Finally, the acting
was serviceable. It is hard to completely differentiate the awful roles
from performances, but the film did dodge some melodrama. The Oscars successfully suckered me into watching Room. I would like to
just chuck this movie atop a pile of other examples where the
illustrious academy failed. But I am apparently in the minority. There
are some aspects of quality filmmaking here, but there is no prize for
best drama for housewives. Room took a premise ripe with potential and
failed to nurture it with a drop of ingenuity or realism. I was
disappointed, and I refuse to believe I am the only one.

"Room" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written
by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book
to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is
a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can
only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering
that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story
about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked
in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this
room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and
around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this
entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's
(the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced
through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or
gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his
mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in
this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained
one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room.
To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like
a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire
movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world.
Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and
innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just
heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he
takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are
things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky,
etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning
when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire
life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after
another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an
experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's
performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a
very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or
being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one
of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not
just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic
performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his
scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness
that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are
chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are
facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful.
The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of-
focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate
consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of
the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film
score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been
crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this
is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly
because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have
been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been
hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does
it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that
it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media
exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact,
I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on
one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or
benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be
washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a
movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember
watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive.

A poor kissing cousin to "Stockholm, Pennsylvania," "Room" is a
backyard shed creating the world's limits to a kidnapped young woman
and her by-the-adbductor son.Snatched at seventeen, Joy (Brie Larson) is imprisoned for seven years
by a standard, un-dimensional psycho holding the power of life and
death over her. (Cross him in the least and there's no electricity or
heat.) At the start, Joy's son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), is angry and
semi-feral yet quite content following silly rules in the only world he
knows. Their pointless days come to an end when Joy contrives Jack's
death forcing the psycho to bury the allegedly dead child.
Well-rehearsed, Jack escapes and the dominoes fall leading to their
escape to a world that has passed by Joy and one in which Jack has zero
knowledge (a first encounter with steps mystifies him).Yellow ribbons and celebrations follow. With opposite effect. Joy's
parents have divorced, high school chums have moved on. A formative
slice of high school track star Joy's life is missing. Joy's biological
dad harshly judges her; mom and daughter fight at the same level of a
rebellious teen railing against parental control.Due to his age, Jack is 'plastic', his societal integration much
easier. Soon he's knocking around a ball with neighbor kid. But, a
reporter's insensitive question causes Joy to break down which leads to
a brief institutionalization. And she's released all better.However, the treatment of an inherently dramatic subject matter of
abduction and reintegration here falls short. The sunshine and
rainbows, feel good ending, while moving, is mawkish. Everyone is
healed and the horror of what was lived through for nearly a decade is
forgotten. It is also a cheap device when children are wiser than
adults. All these problems of the script.The balance of the failure of this film rests squarely on Brie Larson's
shoulders. Her portrayal, as others, is at arms length with the
character and hit a wall keeping her from connecting with feelings.
Many crow her portrayal is spectacular. For her it is. In the annals of
effective acting it is middling. Therefore, this is her tour de force -
by default."Stockholm, Pennsylvania" took the protagonist's story to a far more
logical, satisfying and shocking conclusion. On the base, sensational
end of the spectrum, TV's "Cleveland Abduction." Find "Room" between
the two. Either a good movie-of-the-week or poor indie sidestepping,
and in some ways trivializing, a horrific subject.Watch "Stockholm, Pennsylvania" instead.

Ma: "You're gonna love it".Jack: "What?".Ma: "The world".Room tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she
raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they
finally get out.Since the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit
on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of
those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how
truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had
to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's
been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after
finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie
was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.Brie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking
home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award,
and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance
and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy
that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much
forgot about "Short Term 12" and her performance in that film that got
very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I
know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was
truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.Lenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film
"Frank", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will
bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for
me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find
anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing.
Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based
on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book
(and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book
say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself
said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but
it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.The first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my
interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's
first act.Jacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this
is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has
been in before and I found out he was in "The Smurfs 2" which wasn't
that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright,
nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids
I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.Now for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act.
The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it
went along.The movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I
said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from
other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get
this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the
book, "Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book",
well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not
because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a
crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered,
then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if
this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a
much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's
violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic
about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never
bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject
like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again,
you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take "12 Years a Slave" as an example:
That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an
amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's
suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what
their been through and say to yourself "Wow, that was truly awful". Now
look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you
to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any
of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but
it didn't even try to develop it.Overall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of
people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do,
but that's just my opinion.

The concept was a good one to take on as there have been a number of
high profile abduction cases over the past twenty years or so. But I
wasn't totally convinced with the script on this one.It was a good effort in showing the psychological problems and scars
that the victims are left with. For me, the best part of the movie was
the last 15 minutes - they were the most realistic. And the final
narration by the young lad was well written - but a five year old
wouldn't be that eloquent. The first half of the story based in the
room didn't really work well in my estimation.Despite that, all the major players did a fine job, although I wouldn't
say Oscar worthy. I wouldn't recommend people to go the movie theater
to see this one - you can wait till it comes round on streaming or a
movie channel - or Red Box.

Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned
Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already
garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of
approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather
uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct
parts.For the first 45 minutes or so, a young mother, Joy, and five year old
son, Jack, appear trapped in a small room where they've been residing
for quite a long time. Eventually it's revealed we're watching a horror
story: seven years earlier, when Joy was 17 years old, she was
kidnapped by a neighborhood pervert, Old Nick, who has kept her
prisoner in a shed next to his house. Old Nick makes what appear to be
weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes Joy whenever he comes
over. There's no escape from the room that only has one skylight window
since Old Nick is the only one who knows the numbers to the combination
lock to enter.Jack is born as a result of Old Nick violating Joy and it's her son
that's the only thing keeping her alive. The child does remarkably well
despite growing up in such a deprived environment. Joy teaches Jack how
to make a birthday cake and he plays with the limited amount of objects
found in the roomoccasionally Old Nick might bring the boy a present
(such as an electric model car). There are of course tensions between
mother and sonJoy doesn't react well when Jack throws a tantrum for
example.The best part of the picture is the way in which Joy and Jack are
rescued from this abominable situation--but unfortunately it's not all
that believable. Joy's plan is to have Jack pretend that he's dead and
instruct him how to escape from inside a rolled up rug after Old Nick
drives away in his pickup to dispose of the "body." The entire escape
is predicated on Old Nick's decision not to check to see if Jack is
really deadas the scene plays out, Old Nick inexplicably backs off
after Joy screams at him not to look at Jack because (as she explains
it to him), she can't stomach the idea of the pervert touching her dead
son. The subsequent way in which Jack miraculously escapes from Old
Nick's truck and the heart- pounding way in which the police figure out
where the little boy came from, make up for the slow-moving turn of
events in Act One.The second half of Room does not have the rising tension found in the
first. The focus on how all the family members adjust is what the
second half of Act Two is all about. Joy returns home to find her
mother Nancy divorced from her father Robert, and now married to Leo.
There is an underdeveloped subplot involving Robert who is repulsed by
the idea that Jack was conceived through rape and that his father was
pervert Old Nick. Robert goes home to an out of state residence and his
catalog of resentments remain unexplored.A better subplot involves the intrusion of the media upon Joy and the
rest of the family. Joy agrees to give an interview to a reporter for
money and she asks her painful questions about what went on with Old
Nick and whether she made the right decision in raising Jack and
depriving him of a normal childhood (the suggestion is made that she
could have convinced Old Nick to leave the newborn Jack anonymously at
a hospital). Conflict develops between Joy and Nancy and eventually there's the
rather predictable trope of Joy attempting suicide. Most critics found
Jack's acclimation to his new found world to be touching and cathartic.
When he bonds with Leo's dog and a new pal next door, all seems right
with the world. And even Joy is seen getting herself together at film's
end.So what is one to think of all this? It's a story that I suppose holds
one's interest to the end; although the central twist (i.e. the
escape), feels contrived. While the young Jacob Tremblay did a fine job
playing Jack, his successful adjustment to the outside world feels to
me much more schematic than cathartic, as many critics insist. As for
Brie Larson, calls for her to win an Oscar for best actress seem
misplaced--although her performance is fine given the pedestrian
script.In the end, Room rises to the level of an average Lifetime movie, with
a few interesting twists and turns here and there but more predictable
elements making up the bulk of the overall proceedings.

-mild spoilers only- I have started writing this while still listening
to the end music.This is not a normal review, this is not a story, these are just my
feelings, 5 minutes after the pictures ended, hopelessly put on paper,
or in this case, a digital writing box, for others to see and to
hopefully relate to.Indelibly Tarkovskian imagery not necessarily in its cinematic
pull-off, but in conveying what it wanted to, a compelling and complete
story of hurt and recovery.The fact that there are two distinct parts to the whole, and that each
one gets about an hour of elaboration, is just a testament to the
profoundly empathetic way this story was told. The first hour or so deals with presenting Room, or, Earth, if you
will, Jack's' one, that is, as aptly as his mother, the transcendent
Brie Larson(Academy-backed affirmation FTW) managed to convey to her
son, where distance is nothing more than repeatedly turning at walls,
magic is people on TV and outer space is seen through a "skylight". The
first ~60 minutes is where all the explaining, planning and escaping
take part, and I for one, have to admit, I was left quite disappointed
by the suddenness of it all. Truly, only at the end had I realized that
the scars that living inside this prison for so many years left on its
inhabitants could not be properly conveyed by keeping them stuck there
the whole time and cutting to credits once they escaped and boy, was I
in for a treat in the last 50 or so minutes of this film.The second part is where all the real magic happens, where we get to
understand just how deep the pain is and what shocks Joy and Jack must
swim through to breathe the air they breathe.What moved me to write this most is that the true miracles we pass by
each day is not our freedom or our health even, mental or otherwise. It
is our children. -The real title of this should be changes. The subtle
leit-motif first presented by the doctor who took care of them when he
said, "it's good that you brought him out while he (his brain) is still
plastic" which is medical term for how well it can adapt to change.- We
see Joy falling deeper and deeper intro depression while Jack
consistently wraps himself around the world around him. He ultimately
helps her(win an Oscar) heal with the wonderful magic of childhood,
which is when we are open and everything is possible. I did not even like kids before seeing this. Now I can safely say that
I understand why my married with kids friends say that children are
true gifts from God. If we can do anything with this, we can learn from it. To never yield
to our preconceptions, to act in spite of fear, to accept and to grow.

There is not much to say about a film like this. No complicated plot
lines, no unnecessary character setups, just a well written story, a
camera and a crew that understands what is going on.The acting is probably the best i have seen in years, at no point do
you get thrown out of the story. Even though one could argue the
filmcould be chopped in half, the acting is so consistent up into the
tiniest roles, that at no point you feel like this isn't really
happening. the emotional arc from the two leads is enormous, and as an
audience you are in it the whole way. If Larson is perfect, then for
Tremblay we need to invent a completely new word.The story reveals itself gradually, which is always brilliant as it
keeps you busy on what exactly is going on. nothing is nicely
'explained' to you. to me this did not feel like a story but like a reality show, with a
very grim topic all the way through. This is one of those lonely gems
in film and let's hope prizes may rain on these actors, writer and
director for their enormous efforts. I hope it won't be missed in the
bulk of big budget nonsense we had to sit through this year. Don't hear
about this film, go see it!

Toilet. Wardrobe. Bed. Bath. Chair One. Chair Two. I have deliberately
left out pronouns because that is the way 5 year old Jack refers to the
items in his tiny world, all he has ever known, a single room he
occupies with his young mother who was snatched on her way home from
school as a teenager 7 years ago and has been imprisoned in 'Room' ever
since. 'Ma' has managed to bring Jack up in this bizarre environment in
as healthy a way as she can, she has obviously taught him to read and
write with the limited resources in 'Room', she makes a game of
exercise, with Jack giggling and running from one end of 'Room' to the
other. Her captor put a small TV in 'Room' at some point, and Jack sees
all the things on it as a great fantasy. There is nothing outside of
'Room' to Jack. Jack and Ma make a birthday cake for Jack's 5th
birthday, but he wonders why there are no candles on it. Every evening
'Old Nick', which is the name Ma and Jack have given her captor, visits
'Room' and rapes her. We see this through Jack's eyes from the slats of
the wardrobe he sleeps in. This film is not afraid to ask a lot of its
audience. Jack has temper tantrums and Ma has 'gone days' when she
doesn't manage to get out of bed. On 'gone days' Jack entertains
himself, just like on the outside world. There are short bursts of
narration from Jack telling us what he understands of his existence.
For reasons I would rather allow you to discover for yourself, Ma
decides that it is time for quite risky attempts for her and Jack to
escape from 'Room', so she starts to plant ideas in Jack's head about
the outside world, she points out a leaf that falls on the skylight and
Jack says 'but it's not green like on TV'. Ma hatches a plan for them
to escape but crucial to her idea is Jack pretending to be ill. She
coaches him on what he must do to convince Old Nick that he must go to
a hospital. This first attempt at freedom fails, so she comes up with
another plan. She coaches Jack again, and in a sequence of agonising
suspense, Jack does get away. I'm giving nothing away telling you all
this, because this is the point at which the film really spreads its
wings (this much has been suggested in the trailers). The early scenes,
although beautifully played, are merely set up for what follows. Ma's
relationship with her own parents and a devoted family friend, Jack's
discovery of everything outside of 'Room' and his growing fondness for
his grandmother (the sublime and criminally underrated Joan Allen).
Ma's father (William H Macy) cannot bring himself to look at Jack and
we are not told why, which feels right. We don't need to be bashed over
the head with what he is thinking. The questions raised are emotionally
complex, staggering. What of the power of unconditional love a child
has for it's mother? Ma questions her ability as a parent and Jack's
response is simply 'But you're Ma'. How do we come to accept the point
at which a child no longer completely depends on us as parents? Why do
we find it so difficult to reconcile feelings of being trapped and
tormented in our minds when we are physically free? It is so refreshing
to see a film that doesn't make announcements about what it wants to
say or signpost it's big moments. They just happen. I am loathe to
point out any particular scene in a film which unfolds so fluidly but
there are two, you will know them when they come, where I dare you,
DARE YOU, not to be an emotional wreck. I am normally pretty good at
keeping myself together when I go to the cinema, but when the credits
rolled here I had to rush to a toilet to compose myself before I left
the building. The great film critic Roger Ebert once said 'It's not
what a movie is about, it's how it is about it'. This film's director,
Lenny Abrahamson, understands this completely. I could describe every
single scene and divulge every plot detail and I truly believe doing so
would not make seeing it any less meaningful. The film is that good.
The balance of subtlety and poignancy is perfect. The music is
incidental and subtle, the camera angles, particularly in the early
cramped scenes, are largely from Jack's point of view, to great effect.
This film even goes to the trouble of managing the viewer's suspension
of disbelief by paying heed to the fact that Jack would not have been
exposed to normal bacteria having been holed up in a small room for so
long.Ma is played by Brie Larson in a performance of such astonishing power
and naturalism that I am reminded of Charlize Theron in 'Monster' and
Meryl Streep in 'Sophie's Choice'. The Academy has nominated four other
actresses for the Oscar out of nothing more than politeness this year.Jack is played by a child actor called Jacob Tremblay. A child actor
depends greatly on their director and co-actors. I can only assume that
during the filming of 'Room', he was nurtured and guided with great
love and care, and I am amazed that he has not become the second
youngest person to be nominated for an Oscar.Joan Allen and William H Macy, who played parents together before in
'Pleasantville', are both excellent here.Out of IMDBs top 250 films, I have seen 135 and rated four of them 10
stars. If 'Room' ever makes it into IMDBs top 250, it will be my fifth
10 star film.

Well, this was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of last
year. Everyone loved and talked about the performances. When I first
saw it, I thought it was good, but after another watch, it doesn't hold
up as much. Let me make this clear, I don't think its bad, it just
isn't as effective on a second (and most likely third) viewing, and Im
a person who believes a great movie can hold up on multiple viewings.
Anyways lets get started.Ill start off with the positives. The performances were pretty great.
Brie Larson, I can't say anything new about her since everyone has
already said how great she was, and I can't disagree with that. Jacob
Tremblay was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly since most child
actors are known for being terrible, but he was great. Even the actors
who weren't in it for very long, like William H Macy, were great. So
all around great acting. The script did have its moments, it wasn't
amazing, but not bad. I think its good for a first time a writing a
screenplay. It had some heavy handed moments, but some subtler moments.
My biggest problem is that some of the characters were somewhat cliché,
but thats really it. Now for the negatives. My biggest problem is that the first third of
the movie, the part that takes place in Room, drags on, a lot. It
didn't bother me as much on my first watch, but on a second watch it
feels like it goes on forever. I know some people found this part very
emotional, but I just couldn't get into it. I started to see some of
the problems on the second watch, which aren't really major problems,
but really bugged me. For instance, the cinematography is kinda bad
(which bugs me since i'm a cinematography buff). There were sometimes
when the characters got a bit hard to feel for after the first third, I
just didn't get invested anymore. Luckily after the first third is
over, it does pick up a lot more and gets a lot more interesting, but
the other part was just unbearable.So in conclusion, Room isn't bad, its just one of those movies that
declines on repeated watch.Final Score: 6/10

I do not understand how this would be an Academy Award nominated movie
for best picture. This could have been a Lifetime movie of the week. In
fact, Lifetime did a more interesting version of the story recently.
The lead performances are forgettable. At no point in watching these
characters did I feel like I was watching a special performance. The
mother's performance was muted. There was no emotion in her. I felt the
like the son was cookie-cut out of the "Michelle" from "Full House"
role. We are supposed to think to ourselves, "Oh isn't he cute as a
button," "doesn't he say the funniest things you ever heard" and "isn't
he so aware of his situation and who he is." Suspense never builds. The
movie ultimately is long and boring. I cannot recommend this movie to
anyone.

The Room got nominated for lots of awards and there were people
claiming that it's the best movie of the year. Moving into the movie
with this hype, there is almost no way to not get excited.In my opinion the plot is separated into two parts. The first part is
really interesting and causes you to think about lots of things, and
this results into some more expectations. Pretty much every scene makes
sense, until the part that Ma rolls Jack into the carpet. And then,
everything goes the opposite way...When Jack goes into the truck, the second part begins. I thought the
movie was starting to get really exciting and dramatic, but it never
happened. I thought the movie can't be that simple. I even thought Jack
was in a dream and everything was just the preview of what will happen.
But he wasn't dreaming. The police immediately found out Ma, and the
rest of the second part is pretty much boring.Now, i don't know if i'm unemotional or something, but i didn't get the
dramatic side of it. I didn't feel what they experienced. The movie is
just not good enough to tell it. Not to mention, there are lots of
logical errors such as them not thinking about breaking the window. I
know that there is a psychological part of it, and actually that's the
point that i'm talking about, the movie just doesn't tell it well
enough.If Jacob Tremblay wouldn't carry the movie by himself with his
absolutely amazing acting, i would definitely give this movie a lower
rating and say that it doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. But he made
the movie acceptable, even though i still think it's really overrated.6/10.

A woman and her child are locked in a room. The child is a boy, though
his distracting long hair and feminine features suggest otherwise, and
the room is his entire world. Room depicts his perspective as his world
changes. Although the movie works on an emotional level without feeling
too manipulative, I disliked the scenario and was bothered by the
questions it raised. How believable is the main characters' captivity,
the extent of their trauma, and their attempts to escape it? I have my
doubts, but I think the audience is supposed to be too in awe of their
maternal bond to care. I, however, wanted a little more intelligence
from the tantrum-prone duo. The mother is saved by a five-year-old with
a facile understanding of his environment. Ignorance is bliss, I
suppose, but let's not pretend it's lovely or enlightening. One could
argue the mother protects her son's purity, but even this seems a
matter of luck given her limited control over the situation. I guess I
can't abandon my intellect to appreciate a child's innocence,
especially when it could have been more effectively preserved by a
little adult cleverness.Rating based on five factors, each worth up to two points: Sound: 1.5;
Acting/Characterization: 2; Script: 1; Visuals: 1; Concept: 0.5Total: 6

I was curious about this film due to many reviews and comments about
Brie Larson's performance as well as its Oscars nominations. But I was
very disappointed. The film left me indifferent. There was no
connection to "Ma". I expected a genius acting by young actress judging
by the hype, but it was average... Of course, it is difficult to act if
one did not actually live it through and it is quite understandable.The only performance that is worth of nominations, from my point of
view, is the one of a little boy. So, all in all it is very puzzling
why this film and Brie Larson was even considered for Oscars or any
other awards..

When I first saw that a new trailer for a film called 'Room was
released online, i had a shiver cast through my spine, dreading that it
wasn't a remake, sequel, or re-release of the 2003 monstrosity that was
'The Room'. How relieved I was to find out it was actually about a
mother and sons journey of escaping from the single, enclosed room
where they were held captive in and then watching the 5 year-old 'Jack'
adapt to the huge world we live in.The main structure of the film splits down into 2 parts; When they're
inside 'Room' and when they've escaped. I completely felt for Brie
Larsons 'Ma' having to raise a child who's only experiences in life
have occurred inside 'Room'. Larsons performance was something that
added so much emotional depth to her character as she manages to show
the psychological damage 'Old Nick' (her kidnapper) has put her
through. The 9 year old Jacob Tremblay added a believable performance
from such a young actor who at times you really feel sorrow for. Then, when the riveting escape sequence is over, the film seems moved
to its second half; The outside world. For me this felt like a complete
shift in the films pass and tone, which I believe was a great decision
as it was almost simulating how our protagonists felt when they were
welcomed back into society. However, I really feel that, whilst the
trailer didn't take anything away from the film for me, it would of
been better not to of shown the fact that they became free of 'Room' Great performances from everyone, an deeply emotional tone, and an
overall great film to watch.One of the best 2015 had to offer.

Room is a simple story that will hit you hard. Brie Larson plays a
young woman (Ma) who was abducted and has been held captive in 'Room'
for 7 years, where she has subsequently given birth to her son Jack.
Jack has never been out of Room and knows nothing else. We see how they cope in day to day life in Room, as the captor brings
them basic rations every day. Throughout the film it is left to our
imagination as to where exactly they are and what is the reason why.
Jack believes that the outside world is non existent and anything he
sees on TV is not real. Jack is key to their escape so Ma has to
explain the situation very carefully to him in order for him to grasp
that the outside world is indeed real. The pacing of the film is very good, we pretty much have two halves:
the first half starts straight away with the pair in Room, we see them
go through many different emotions in their fight for survival. Then
they plan the escape (which if you have seen any trailer for the film
you will know that they eventually escape anyway so it's not a
spoiler). The second half of the film is about both of them adjusting
to the outside world. Ma going back to family life and facing struggles
as her father can't even look at Jack. Thankfully her mum and mum's
boyfriend are much more supportive and really help Jack along the way. The acting is terrific throughout the film which gave it a lot of
realism. I do wish that the film had perhaps been a bit more detailed,
we could've had another 20-30 minutes which could've explained briefly
how the captor took Ma, what exactly happened to him at the end and how
he was caught, a few bits of news/interviews detailing the fact that
she was missing, search parties for her, was anyone ever suspicious of
him etc. And also a bit more of Ma and Jack as he was younger just to
get a sense of even more struggle they went through and then perhaps a
little segment at the end of him growing up in the world. All in all though it is certainly my favourite film of the Oscar
nominees for best picture this year. 9/10 and highly recommended to all.

'ROOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed dramatic thriller flick; directed by Lenny
Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue (based on her 2010 novel, of
the same name). The film is about a young mother, being held captive in
a locked single-room, with her 5-year-old son. The boy has never known
life, outside of the room; so his mother creates a complete alternate
reality, inside the room for him. It stars Brie Larson and newcomer
Jacob Tremblay, as the kidnapped mother and son. It also costars Sean
Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The film is predicted to be a
likely Oscar contender, come awards time, and it's received almost
unanimously positive reviews, from critics. I liked it.Jack (Tremblay) is five-years-old, and he's been locked in a single-
room, with his mother Joy (Larson), all of his life. He's never seen
the world, outside of the room, and his mother has taught him 'room' is
all there is. We later learn that Joy was kidnapped when she was 17,
and her captor impregnated her, with Jack, five-years earlier. As Joy
becomes even more desperate, to escape, she finally enlists Jack's
help, in a dangerous plan. The film is really dark and depressing, but there's also a slight bit
of hope (in the darkness). Larson is fantastic in the lead, and
Tremblay is also amazing (especially for an actor so young). The movie
is very moving, intense and heartbreaking; it's beautifully directed by
Abrahamson, and brilliantly written by Donoghue. The film is basically
everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'. It's
pretty hard to watch though, at times, but it's worth it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:

Although brutal at times, credit has to be given to The entire cast of
Room for churning out one of the Masterpieces of this generation. Brie
Larson has done a career defining role who i firmly Believe deserves
every award this season but the ultimate acting "masterclass" at such a
tender age has to be the kid playing her son. Imagine discovering whole
world again right from the Beginning like you did when you were a kid.
Remember the first time you saw a dog ? The First time you saw trees ?
The first time you made a friend ? The first time you left your mom ?
This movie shows subtleness of mom- child relationship in such a
beautiful way that it Forced even a heartless beast like me cry. The
movie never drags, is unapologetically intense Cinematography makes you
feel like a 5 year Old again. The direction is immaculate and Script is
powerful. Probably one of the best movies of 2015 ! Must watch :)

I had never heard about this movie (or the book on which is based)
until I got a call from my cousin inviting me to see it. When I heard
its name, my first reaction was "is it a horror movie?". And she
explained that it wasn't and told me briefly the story. I'll try to
tell as little as I can, because I believe one of the reasons this film
had such a huge impact on me was precisely my lack of previous
knowledge.Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a five-year old boy, lives with his mother Joy
(Brie Larson) in a tiny room in precarious conditions. The boy has very
long hair, is still breastfed, and sleeps inside the closet. Soon you
realize they are not there by option: Joy was kidnapped 7 years before
and Jack was born there, inside that room, which he believes to be the
only thing that exists in the world. He has absolutely no idea that
there is an "outside" behind the door.I had all the possible emotions while watching Room. I was sad, happy,
angry, and nervous (almost having a heart attack during an specific
scene). Even my cousin was on the edge of her seat and she already knew
what was going to happen.Everything in this film is great, starting with the cast. Brie Larson
is so perfect with her portrayal of a young woman who has been through
such a trauma that I strongly believe she has real chances to be
awarded for this role. Her character is so complex and she's able to
transmit to us the sadness due to the situation and the happiness for
having her son with her. And, of course, the boy! Jacob Tremblay is
perfect and you can't help but feel both sorry and sympathetic towards
him. He is so genuinely naïve and oblivious of the bad (and good)
things in the world that is impossible not to like him.Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-fB

Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best
performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may
not quite get past the whole "kid actor" stereotype he is admittedly
better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of
these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is
this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot
line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five
years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or
experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets
to see everything for the first time.Yes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it
can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making
this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote
the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl'
actually had a good director.The one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high
hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is
a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is
saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've
probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show
characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to
write accordingly.But this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film
fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was
pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of
cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly
artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was
from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend
like these two had never made one single escape attempt.Literally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help
think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even
hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film
reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person
and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the
main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at
whoever they wanted for no apparent reason. Almost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between
random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made
you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to
legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other
then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason.'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it
up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about
its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at
each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best
qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately
adapt the acclaimed novel.

I have never seen such an emotional film with so much sense, feeling
and so on. I would recommend it for all the people who just want to
watch an extremely good drama. The kid's acting is amazing with that
age. He is acting like a real actor: he cries, he laughs, he feels, he
can feel everything and maybe this makes this movie so amazing. The
first hour is really exciting as well and the other part of the film is
just simply beautiful. Everything is happening in the good direction
and they needed to be happy after they escaped but it is much more
difficult because they have to start the life from the beginning.
Especially the Jack has to be known with everything in this real world.
He has to know people, pets, plants, seas..

Room is one of those movies that radiates a special kind of emotional
power that sticks to each and every viewer and stays with them long
after they've walked out of the theater. It has that unique charm and
ability to relate with its audience that can only be pulled off when
everyone involved is truly dedicated and puts their heart and soul into
everything they do. And that's exactly the case with Room.Child actor Jacob Tremblay stars as the five-year-old Jack, a boy who
has spent his entire life enclosed in a single room with his mother.
He's never met another person in his life. His only glimpse of the
world outside of "Room" is a single skylight. He struggles to
comprehend the fact that an entire world exists outside of Room. It's a
tricky role for anyone, especially a young actor, to pull off, but
Tremblay shines in the role. In fact, he more than just shines. He's
out of this world, delivering a performance that feels almost too
realistic. He's remarkably natural in such a difficult role. Tremblay
may have a small presence in the literal sense, but his screen presence
dominates almost every scene he's in. Jacob Tremblay is not just a cute
kid (which he is) who was hired just to look cute and say cute things.
His performance is one for the history books. But what recognition that Tremblay may have lacked for his role went
instead to his almost as worthy co-star, Brie Larson. Larson, an
actress whom I only really knew for her extraordinary work in the film
Short Term 12 (another indie gem), stars alongside Tremblay as Joy
Newsome, or "Ma," as our protagonist knows her. Joy, who was captured
by a man known to us only as "Old Nick" at the age of 17, has been kept
in that single room for seven years. She's been raped by her captor
nearly every night she's been there. And she's had to raise her son all
on her own, in one room, for five whole years. Talk about a difficult
role to pull off. Yet Brie Larson was a more than perfect choice for
the role. Joy is an emotionally tortured and damaged woman. Not only
does she obviously suffer from severe depression (cruelly ironic for a
character named Joy, don't you think?), but she has had to struggle
with pure isolation and damaging abuse for seven long years. Her plight
is nearly unimaginable -- yet, apparently, not for Brie Larson. The
26-year-old actress disappears into her pained, conflicted character.
Larson exhibits both her character's powerful maternal love and care
for her son, and Joy's internal struggle both inside and outside of
Room. With two leads like these ones, it's honestly hard to believe that
we're watching actors. They make it feel like we're actually watching a
mother and her son, and they appear as if they've really been through
their characters' ordeal. And a lot of their success has to do with how
well they act together. As strong as they each are, I find it hard to
believe that this movie could have had one without the other. They play
off each other to perfection -- Tremblay follows Larson's each and
every word, while Larson keeps up with Tremblay's energy and curiosity.
Their chemistry is the core of this movie, and because it's so good,
the movie works so damn well. These two outstanding lead actors are mostly to thank for the film's
undeniably raw emotional power, but I can't discredit everyone else
involved. Emma Donoghue wrote the screenplay as an adaptation of her
own novel. I haven't read the novel (yet), but her script here is one
of the best this year. The premise she created shows off great
imagination and creativity, but perhaps more notably, she writes her
characters' transition from Room to the outside world to perfection.
It's a wonderful script flawlessly translated onto the screen by
director Lenny Abrahamson. Abrahamson does it all in this movie. At one
point, he has the entire audience confined into that one claustrophobic
space with Joy and Jack. At another, he drives the audience (and Jack)
out into the outside world in one of the most intense, powerful
sequences I have ever experienced.What else is there to say? The score is magnificent. The cinematography
is impressive. The supporting cast is solid. But all of that and more
almost feels like an afterthought to all the emotion that this film
hits you with. You grow attached to these characters and this story
like few others. Room has you laughing and smiling when it's happy, on
the edge of your seat and counting your breaths when it's tense and
gripping, and on the verge of tears at it's most touching and
cathartic. Is it cheap for a movie to rely on its audiences' emotions
to be effective? Maybe. But when it does it this well, it's hard to
forget.Room may be hard to get through for some. It's dark, it's realistic,
and it brings up many questions that some of us may not want to ask
ourselves. But from the perspective of an innocent young child, and
with the story's emphasis on the unbreakable bond of love shared
between mother and son, it's as uplifting and hopeful as a film with
this subject matter can be. This story of adjusting to a new world and
leaving an old one behind is hard to illustrate for those who have not
been fortunate enough to experience yet. It's a tale that's absorbing
like nothing else, and, in a way, almost strangely relatable. So if you
haven't experienced Jack's incredible story yet, I'll just leave you
with this one last quote that only begins to describe this film's
message and power -- "You're going to love it," Joy tells her son as
she prepares him for escape. "What?" asks Jack, curiously. "The world."

Emma Donoghue adapted her popular novel ROOM for the screen so we are
assured the concept it contains are the original ones from her story of
a kidnapped young girl sequestered in a shed, birthing a child by her
abductor, and raising that child to accept his environs as real until
the two breakout of the shed and encounter the world.Or as the company who created the film states, 'ROOM tells the
extraordinary story of Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a spirited 5-year-old who
is looked after by his loving and devoted mother Ma (Brie Larson). Like
any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe,
nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like
playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but
typical-- they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma
has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for
Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in
this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and
fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows,
and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan
to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out
to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.The star of the film is Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson does a credible
turn as Ma and the 'outsiders'  Ma's parents Joan Allen, William H.
Macy and her kidnapper Sean Bridges  carry their weight. The film is
unnecessarily long and that need for editing diminishes the
extraordinary impact of Jack as he discovers the real world. If young
Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay secures the right agent he could become a
very important actor in the future. The story concept is excellent and
carries many messages to which we should all pay heed.

An unsuspecting 5 year old boy narrates his life as he transitions from
the "room" in which he grew up to the real world. In all of his
childlike curiosities and passions, he manages to bring joy to his
mother, Joy. And he keeps her alive with his immeasurable, child-like,
Sampson-esque, hopeful strength. At least three times he manages to
save his mothers life. All because of the pure, unrefined love that
comes of child- bearing and childhood dependence. Jack, the protagonist, is my hero. If I could love others the way he
loves his mother, I would be a man befitting the greatest rewards in
heaven.

This movie makes me feel bad and I want to kill old nick in real life.
Very nice story, the kid is so special in acting. He might won the best
actor in Oscar instead of Leonardo di carpio. Brie Larson is
spectacular, never thought she is real good. I only have questions, why
grandpa cannot look or stare in the eye of jack? its because he can't
accept that he have a grandchild or he is the father of jack? i just
confuse.This movie is great one of a kind. Kudos for the writer and the
director you bring different food on the table. This movie would be a
game changer in drama category.

To start up, I honestly haven't seen such a good movie as this one for
a longer time. It is so emotional and heartbreaking watching those two,
firstly in Room, then in the real world as well. I found interesting
realizing the oscillations in getting used to the whole massive change
between a grownup and a child. Freedom is relative, this movie proves
it. So is space and boundaries. If you don't know what's on the other
side of the wall and don't even know the other side even exists, you
feel safe. You don't doubt your freedom at all. Jack felt like
everything is happening with a reason, just the way it should be. His
imagination made him believe that. It was also quite interesting
watching how Jack's thoughts broadened up as time was passing by. I was
surprised how well he adapted to new surroundings, unlike his poor
mother. She was questioning herself a lot, every single day, got really
overwhelmed and I saw her crash coming a few times throughout the
movie. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her considering how strong
and resilient she stayed.

Here's the catch-22 with sexual violence: we need to talk about it, but
we don't want to. Can you blame us? It's horribly omnipresent in
society, but disturbingly easy to largely overlook out of convenience,
between those shameful deniers who live in a
sunshine-and-rainbow-unicorns world where only consensual sex happens,
and those who are all too aware of the tragic rates of sexual assault,
but wouldn't mind an understandable break from contemplating its
awfulness. Factoring in all those folks, and the poor,
article-challenged audiences wandering into the wrong screening
carrying spoons and bellowing "YOU'RE TEARING ME APAAAAAAART, LISA!!!",
it wouldn't be a surprise to consider Room a hard-sell as a carefree
Friday night at the movies. Thankfully, Irish-Canadian author-turned-screenwriter Emma Donoghue has
neatly nipped the paradox in the bud by extending the 'only poetry can
properly explicate the hidden depths of trauma' maxim to the next
level. Room is innately a powerful, necessary, even beautifully moving
story of suffering, survival, resilience, and rebuilding. But filtered
through the eyes of a child? A masterpiece. Situating five-year old Jack as narrator not only raises the stakes to
almost unbearable dimensions - not only must they survive and escape,
but Jack must not know - but gives us a far less graphic or painful
'indirect narrator' through which to focalize and make sense of the
nuances of his and his Ma, Joy's imprisonment. Director Lenny
Abrahamson allows Jack's whimsical boisterousness to shape the film,
and the cameras and music mirror his exuberant attention span, bouncing
around every corner of the enclosed set with the lilting dance of a
surrealist fairy tale. Abrahamson imbues his film with such life that
it's easy to empathize with Jack believing Room to be the entirety of
existence beyond the fantasies of heaven and TV (and all without any of
the tacky, exploitative FX interludes of Peter Jackson's take on The
Lovely Bones). There is darkness here as well, even if Jack may not
understand the full ramifications of the ominous creaking ensuing from
the weekly visits from their grimy caretaker, but his accepting this as
part of the fabric of life, in turn, makes it easier for us to bear as
well, without lessening the traumatic context in the slightest. In fact, Abrahamson handles the first half of Room with such deft,
immaculate precision that we're too busy in survival mode to fully let
it all sink in. Cherishing each fleeting scrap of Jack and Ma's
happiness, and bemoaning the petty squabbles which infest their
relationship, there's almost a palpable feeling of "if we keep it
together and hold on, they will too". It's only upon Jack's escape -
and I dare you to find a more unbearably tense sequence in recent
memory - and immersion into the overstimulating sensory flurry of an
outside world he previously disavowed the existence of, that we start
to feel release. It's only when we are given threads of hope to cling
to - that Jack could bounce back, and actually be okay - that we, like
Ma, are permitted to finally break, to let go, to grieve, and to
rejoice. Donoghue's piercing, conversational screenplay teases out the ripple
effects of Jack and Joy's release with gently unflinching care: the
inevitable madhouse of paparazzi attention; Jack has no conception of
how to play with toys, and requires sunscreen at all times due to his
skin's lack of outdoor exposure; Joy's father, who cannot look at his
grandson out of what he represents (wonderful William H. Macy at his
most heartbreakingly earnest); her mother and new partner desperately
striving for normalcy (the pristinely warm and sturdy Joan Allen and
Tom McCamus). And just when we start clawing for a continual crescendo
of hope, we're subjected to a talk show host interviewing Joy with a
winsome, rage-inducing, abominable lack of tact Harry Potter fans will
immediately associate with the similarly despicable Dolores Umbridge.
Who knew Donoghue could conjure up a character more hateable than Joy's
rapist. But, deft plotting and immaculate directing aside, Room as a triumphant
two-hander. Brie Larson, having just closed an awards circuit with a
hat-trick of accolades, still manages to exceed expectations with an
incomparably brave performance, allowing her to play strong, vibrant,
caring and clever, but brittle, frayed, and, essentially, very young -
often all with a single look, or defeated slouch. Still, Room is Jack's
story, and eight-year old Jacob Tremblay carries the film with an
overwhelming talent unseen in almost any of his older contemporaries.
There's never a moment of Jack that doesn't feel agonizingly real, and
Tremblay's use of eye contact, or avoidance thereof, allows so much of
a richer entry point into Jack's soul than even his endearingly shrill
voice and fidgety physicality - he plays Jack as fundamentally unshowy
and real, and is all the more captivating amidst the absurd
circumstances he's surrounded by. It's arguably the most impressive
performance of the year, and will unquestionably stand the test of time
as one of the most powerful child actor performances ever captured on
film. Unassuming and harrowingly stripped-down, hugely emotional, yet never
false or saccharine, Room was a quieter entry into the 2015 awards
circuit, yet by far the year's most haunting and essential work. It's
utterly devastating, and yet, in unexpected ways, also certain to make
your world a little brighter. When we, alongside Jack and Joy, say
"bye" to Room, it's with a similar mixture of a heavy heart, tears, and
unsettling regret that we let go of a world so horrific yet beautiful.
Room reminds us to appreciate and cherish what's dear - and where
better to start than with such an unforgettably human piece of cinema. -10/10

I didn't really have any big expectations when going into 'Room' - I
initially thought it looked like one of those Oscar bait titles that
tries way too hard to be emotionally powerful and becomes an overdone
melodrama. However, after seeing a few scenes and realising that it's
directed by Lenny Abrahamson (previously having directed the quirky
masterpiece known as 'Frank') it intrigued me, and started to look like
a lot more than just typical Oscar bait... and thankfully, it was. This
is one of those beautiful films that manages to capture the strength of
love and the importance of family, as well as reminding us that the
less we have, the more we appreciate.'Room' tells the story of a devoted mother's relationship with her
five-year-old son, Jack, who has been living in an enclosed 'room' ever
since he was born. This is essentially the boy's whole world for the
first five years of his life, which immediately establishes the mother
as a strong and loving character with the determination to bring up her
son properly, providing him with happiness and creativity despite their
harsh living conditions. Abrahamson often incorporates tight framing
and close-up shots here in order to signify how restricted these
characters are in a physical sense, yet how open they are emotionally -
making for some genuinely heartfelt interactions. This is where the
film succeeds, seeing a realistic relationship between a loving mother
and her young son is truly heart-warming, especially if you take their
limited surroundings into consideration. Even when the tone switches
and tension is built up, realism is still maintained, the characters
feel just as engaging, and the overall atmosphere is handled pretty
well throughout.Unfortunately, despite how well these interactions work, the focus
always leans towards the character of Jack and his perspective of the
world, with segments featuring narration from the little boy himself as
he adjusts and learns about the real world for the first time. This
basically provides us with the typical portrayal of children in films
like this - innocent, naive and somewhat cute... and although there
isn't anything wrong with the execution of this, it's nowhere near as
captivating as the actual relationship between the mother and the son.
After a while, the film starts to slightly lose focus in general, by
including some drama which felt somewhat forced and unnecessary.
However, these are just minor flaws in the grand scheme of things.In terms of cinematography, the film seems to switch between Dogme 95
style filming (handheld/steadicam) and standard static shots, which
feels quite inconsistent in terms of style, but works pretty well
regarding the atmosphere being conveyed. When it comes to acting,
everyone pulled off a magnificent job; Brie Larson winning an Oscar for
this role was well-deserved, and although I'm not really a fan of child
actors (they can either be great or just really cringe-worthy), I
thought Jacob Tremblay was pretty fantastic in his role. All in all,
this is a heart-warming story with some phenomenal performances and
beautiful sequences that will undoubtedly tug at your heartstrings,
which is why I'm giving this film a very strong 8,4/10.

Saddest movie you will see this year. And I'm not talking tear-and-
tissue sad, I'm talking bury-a-hole-and-crawl-into-it sad. Beyond
words, but let's give it a try.Room?Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was kidnapped when she was seventeen years
old and locked up in a shed, left completely at the mercy of her
kidnapper. Two years later she bears a son, called Jack (Jacob
Tremblay). Not being able to leave 'Room', as she calls it from then
on, Joy decides to raise him in that tiny enclosed space, as if it were
the only place in the world. This is the devastating story of a mother
and her son; who, for five years, literally only have each other. And
how they're able to continue their life after that.Jack's storyI can't even make a joke about this. This might very well be one of the
most uncomfortable movies I have ever seen. Especially during the first
half; I was constantly cringing and my heart was racing. Which is weird
because there is nothing explicit to cringe at nor is there a lot of
suspense to get nervous about. Everything about this film excels at
telling a story but without showing it. It's something you have to see
for yourself because however difficult it is to watch, it is also
extremely compelling. The way Jack narrates their lives as a story,
talks about items in Room as persons and how they spend their time
everyday. But especially how Joy creates a world, within a room, for
Jack to grow up in; out of reach for 'Old Nick', as they call him.There is this one scene where all you see is five-year-old Jack, hidden
in the wardrobe, listening to the creaking of the bed and just
counting. But you know what is happening and the filmmakers even make
it look like it's an everyday routine. It's Room's strongest feat, an
uneasiness that creeps in and stays for the rest of the film.Of course all of this would amount to nothing without a stellar cast.
Brie Larson as Joy Newsome is nothing short of excellent; in between
her boundless love and dedication towards Jack, she shows a constant
air of frustration, dread and desperation. The film's creators are
brutally honest about this too; she's not a saint, she's a mom.The real revelation however was Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Working with
child actors is never easy and that goes double for a role like this,
but this kid gets it. You don't just feel sorry for him, you feel with
him. To the point that Tremblay's character almost feels familiar.
Which might sound effed up, considering the situation, but everyone has
their 'Room'.ConclusionSeemingly effortless, Room will touch you and Room will hurt you.

Watching "Room" is like taking in a film on the Lifetime channel with
an A-list cast and a big budget. Like the novel that was the basis for
the film, there is a two-part melodramatic structure to the narrative.Melodrama #1 depicts the harrowing captivity of a woman held hostage by
her captor for a seven-year period in a dingy, claustrophobic shed in
the offender's back yard. Two years into captivity, the woman delivered
a baby boy, who is now five years old. The first half of the film plays
out like a Harold Pinter drama with the mundane dialogue of the mother
and son, plus menacing visits from the captor.The second melodramatic action follows the daring escape of the child,
who is successful in alerting the authorities, who free the mother from
the shed. The second half of the film is the more engaging because it
introduces the family members and seeks to portray the recovery of the
traumatized mother and child. Unfortunately, there are too many plot
holes in this intense drama, the most glaring of which is the
insensitivity of the grandfather character, as played by W. H. Macy.The screenplay was adapted by Emma Donoghue from her novel, and her
strong suit is in storytelling, not character motivation. At one of the
crucial junctures of the film, when the mother needed support from the
family, the grandfather refused to even look at the boy.In the novel, it is made clear that the father is tormented by the idea
that the grandson would have the same face as the perpetrator who
abducted and raped his daughter. But in the film, the little boy's face
is a dead ringer for the mother--not the father. The motivation was not
spelled out in the screenplay, and the film's director was completely
oblivious of the unmotivated action of the grandfather. In the DVD's
commentary track, the director spoke of deleting a scene where the
grandfather peeks into the bedroom of the little boy, but still cannot
bring himself to look at the child. By restoring that scene, the
motivation for Macy's character would still be confusing to the
audience.At the premiere of the film at the Landmark Theatre on West Pico in Los
Angeles, there was an artistic installation of the 11' X 11' room that
was recreated on the site. Such a display indicates the shortcomings of
this film in the superficial treatment of a serious topic. This film
should have offered a strong social commentary about predators like the
one who abducted the young woman. Shouldn't the television reporter be
investigating the perpetrator, instead of grilling the young woman, as
we see in the film? The overall effect of the film sadly trivializes a
serious subject and turns a topic that should evoke moral outrage into
a routine tearjerker.

Emma Donoghue's novel, inspired no doubt by the likes of the Josef
Fritzl case in Austria, 2008, has been rewritten by the author herself
for the screen. It's a mighty challenging undertaking and benefits to
some degree by not being 'based on a true story' even if the
inspiration was so obviously horrifically apparent.It tells the tale of a young mother, credited as 'Ma' but actually
known as Joy (how ironic) played to Oscar winning standard by Brie
Larson and her five year old son, Jack, who was born in captivity some
time after Joy was absconded by a man entrapping her with the aid of a
sick puppy.Thus begins Joy's nightmare. At some point Jack is conceived at the hands of her rapist jailer, Old
Nick, played by Sean Bridgers. (It's a casting that may have given him
some personal nightmares because he's not what you could describe as a
sympathetic character). It's fair to say that although Ma tolerates
Nick's visitations, she has to to protect her child and to be fed, no
Stockholm Syndrome has developed.The movie begins on or around Jack's fifth birthday. Jack has never left the room in which he was conceived and into which
he entered his insular world. He knows no place other than this, has
never experienced any weather (or air even), never played with other
children, never been admonished for fear of upsetting a very delicate
ecology between him, his mother and the 'room' where they live.Aside from the nightly visitations of Old Nick for the daily rape of
his mother he knows no other human being.Ma and Jack have a TV, so Jack has a perverse awareness of the 'world'
but it's seen through juddering images and is as real to him as
martians are to you and I.But somehow Ma and Jack soldier on.We catch them at the end of Ma's tether. After five years of protecting
Jack from the fact that they live in a parallel existence she's decided
it's time for the facts of life and so begins a plan to escape. You'll
have seen the trailers so you'll know that ultimately the escape bid is
successful and so begins the painful psychological process of leaving
an almost feral yet totally sheltered existence into a world that's
overwhelming.Relationships in the family have moved on in the years since Joy's
disappearance. Mum and Dad, although both still alive cope in very
different ways. The media go mad for the story, Joy finds the whole
thing extremely difficult to cope with and we spend a very moving hour
or so watching them come to terms with an existence that's completely
alien to Jack and totally overwhelming for Joy. This is a life affirming movie. It's directed with great skill and
sensitivity by Lenny Abrahamson and in Brie Larson and five year old
Jacob Tremblay we can pretty much believe that this is not fiction but
very real reality.A remarkable film that deserves all the awards that are about to come
its way.Deep respect.

Room deserves to receive Best Picture this year. Hands down Room
deserves to win. Forget The Revenant, which is an absurdly violent
study in male macho-masculinity with only one woman character for a
split second who is being raped.Room is a profoundly deep film told from the perspective of both a
young woman and her child born unto her in captivity via being a
hostage sex slave. The film tells much of the story from the eyes of an
innocent 5 year old who knows only this Room and his Ma. The young
woman does an amazing job holding it together to take care of her young
child. It is a story of human survival, motherly love and the ultimate
strength and goodness of (most) people.There are so many layers to this movie. I felt for everyone. The story
of the young woman (Brie Larson) is rather downplayed. There was so
much more to tell about her - how did she endure the nightly (or near
nightly rapes), how did she give birth by herself in this Room, how did
she manage on so many levels? I also felt for her parents, it would be
hard to accept this child, the child born from rape and forced
impregnation. She was a 17 year old, a little girl, the last time her
parents saw her, now she is a woman with a child born from these
circumstances.The perspective of the child is fascinating. Never having seen "the
world." Knowing only his Ma. So innocent.This movie is disturbing and haunting. I left the theater thinking
about it off and on for the next several days. Thinking through all the
complexity of what she (Ma / Brie Larson) went through and her parents
and all sorts of things.Somehow, for such a horrific subject, the film manages to bring out the
positive in how hard a woman can fight for survival, how strong she can
be to take care of her child. It is an amazing film. It's heavy and
heartbreaking but it's also beautiful.It deserves all the awards!

When you wake up saying good morning bed, good morning laptop, good
morning TV, good morning carpet. it means this movie got you & it is
really something!Give that boy an Oscar! he deserves it. the chemistry between Jacob and
Brie was so high, so natural, so genuine that i still think she is his
mom! the best thing i liked about the movie next to the excellent
acting of course, is the fact they did not give us a mere thriller
movie.. watch it and i am sure anyone who did, surely shed tears. There
are many gem scenes stuck to my mind.. I don't want to spoil the movie
for you, you just gotta see it and you won't regret it i am confident
about it. Enjoy

I went into this movie with some excitement. The trailers didn't make
it out to be that great of a movie (originality-wise), but the ratings
said otherwise. I am happy to say that this movie surpassed all my
expectations and then some. The plot of Room is one that we've seen before. While it's not horribly
original, it's presented much differently than you'd expect. It's more
mature than others, and much more personal. The idea of someone living
their life away from society and suddenly being exposed to it again is
typically used in a more comedic or 'big picture' way. Room deals with
the transition in a much more personal way, and it makes way more
sense. The characters spend most of their time indoors, dealing with
the new problems of living outside of a single 10 by 10 foot room, and
there still feels like there's a reason for it. It really is quite a
beautiful story, despite how unhappy that it can be. The characters are brilliant, and the obvious driving force of the
movie. Considering for the first hour or so we've only been exposed to
three people you really get to know them well. But what are great
characters without great actors to portray them? Luckily, Brie Larson
as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack are both fantastic. For a child actor
Tremblay is phenomenal, and really sells his character. Larson is
fantastic too, playing a single mother who's not exactly in the best
shape. Everyone else is great too, but the two main protagonists stand
out the most. The first thing I noticed about this movie was the realism. From the
opening to the end, everything felt real. Emotionally, it was real
(I've already stated that), but it was also visually real. The
characters looked real. At the beginning of the movie Ma has a bit of
acne, and that really stood out to me. Finally, a movie where people
don't have make-up coating their face so that they appeal more to the
audience. Brie Larson looked her part, she had acne, bags under her
eyes, bad hair. She didn't look like she was trying to impress anybody,
which is because she wasn't. This is something that I don't think I've
ever seen in a movie, where people look bad and it's never part of the
story or addressed or anything, and it really adds the level of
immersiveness in the film. This movie is very emotional. And I don't mean that there's just some
climatic sad part at the end, it's spread out. Throughout the movie I
felt myself on the brink of tears, and that was with resistance. It
brought me closer to crying than any other movie that I've ever seen. Overall Room is absolutely amazing. It's one of the few movies I've
seen where not a thing about it has bothered me. I found no flaw in
this movie, making it easily one of the best movies of 2015, if not the
best movie of 2015. It's realistic and unique, something that so many
movies seem to lack. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie
to anyone, whether your interested or not.

A beautifully told story through the eyes of a brilliant 5 year old.
Such innocence beautifully portrayed.Great performances, a good film. Nothing more.I have a few issues with this film1) Would the mother trust her child with a man who was willing to keep
them captive for so many years? 2) How lucky, Old Nick put the rug on the right hand side of the truck,
meaning Jack could roll out to the left as practiced.3) Why would Old Nick just drop Jack like that?4) It took all of 30 mins to locate both the room and Old Nick.5) Surely wouldn't Jack & Ma have more psychology damage?

There it is the first movie of the award season which I did not think
much of. Don't get me wrong it's a decent but thoroughly average film.
The movie starts out promisingly and does a couple of things right,
makes no mistakes but does nothing special or extraordinary with the
situation. I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the
psychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but
it didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for
worse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about
them in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first
half. The acting is definitely the strong suit of the film, Brie Larson
is amazing and I would be OK with her winning the Oscar, though I
didn't think much of the film I thought she was great. The kid played
by Jacob Tremblay showed amazing depth and variety for a young child.
The weakness of the film is direction, it does not capitalizes on it's
setting, it has no great scenes and does not visually grab you at
anytime (I am not reading a book I am watching a movie), also sometimes
Brie Larson's character is quite inconsistent and unrealistic
sometimes, she shows very few signs of PTSD, it sometimes feels she was
trapped in Room for weeks not seven years, not her fault though,
another misstep by the director, along with not capitalizing that Jack
maybe better off without Joy (it touches so less on the REAL issues
it's infuriating).

It's too long and it gets very very boring some times. There are a lot
o movies which exploit much better this idea In the beginning of the
movie there is not even a clue what is going on but i guess this is a
movie trick used by the director.It's not about the fact that they have
not escaped in those years. It's about the fact that the movie,after
they escape shows a very little preoccupation for the true situation of
the characters,of the inside fight. At least it is a better candidate
for the Oscar prize, but it is not a movie which deserves a position in
top 250 or to be nominated for Oscars. It is good when you put it
besides the big short,spotlight,the revenant,bridge of spies, but come
on... I hope Mad max will have a serious chance for winning the prize

I've just returned from the pictures after watching this film. Great
performance from the young boy Jack, but doesn't carry the film.Too
many unanswered questions and holes in the plot lines. The worst
was:-three slows and a stop, and robocopette leads them directly to the
shed??? really??? I left the pictures when they found the dog toy
behind the settee. probably not a great admission for a reviewer, but
it had seemed to have slipped back into maudlin and lethargy. maybe I
missed the best bits, but did I really have to get into a state of
boredom before I could appreciate it? just because Jacks' like was full
of tedium and repetition, doesn't mean the point has to be hammered
home so effectively. there is nothing wrong with slow moving films as
long as it is effective.films where you wonder whats around the corner
rather than hope.I have only left a film once before. Hostel.Ankles. I
couldn't watch anymore, and for completely differing reasons, and
neither could I tonight.

Within the first 10 minutes of this film, I was curious as to where the
writer was going to take the story. Do the mother and son break out? Do
they just accept their fate and live there for eternity? Does one of
them die? Well, the writers did a great job of surprising me as it
seems as if they have never heard of the three act structure.The production value, I digress, was very well done. Good direction,
excellent performances, cinematography, etc. For a small budget, it was
well done. That's about all I have to say I liked about this film.Back to the story... I'm not going to spoil it here, but as I was
saying before the film doesn't follow a three act structure at all.
Some films can get away with this, namely some cheesy 80's comedies,
but these are comedies, not dramas.In room, there's no call to action,
journey to overcome a goal, obstacles in the way of that goal, point of
no return, etc. There are subplots that have their own beats, but not a
main story.There is sort of a climax at one part. It happens literally half way
through the movie, and then the rest of the movie is the resolution,
for a whole hour in which you'll be checking the time hoping to god the
movie will be over soon. If you have ever thought at the end of a movie, once a character has
overcome their weaknesses and achieved their goals, what happens after
the film fades to black? The character ought to go on with life, where
he or she will face more challenges to come. This film almost seems
like it has a fourth act that merely explores this idea. It delves way
too far into the aftermath of the events that happen only an hour into
the film.There is also a slush of subplots that don't know where they want to
weave themselves into the story as they aimlessly fly throughout the
film. Here's the beef to my arguments (SPOILERS):First, as I've mentioned before, the story is horribly structured. It
starts with about 40 minutes of repetitive introduction, followed by a
20 minute long second act in which they break out, and an hour long
resolution in which Jack and his mother deal with the real world.Some may say that it does follow the three act structure and that I'm
just missing the real story, which is Jack growing into a world outside
of Room. Well here's the problem; if The introduction had included the
escape, and then the second act focused on Jack struggling to fit into
the regular world until he overcomes his fears, then I'd say it's
appropriate to say the story is focused on a boy being exposed to a
world he's never seen before. This isn't the case however, as Jack isn't exposed to the real world
until the second half of the movie, and this story line is barely
glossed over in my opinion.In this movie it seems you have three plots: -Ma's growth and struggle
as a kidnapped mother -Jack's coming of age into the world outside of
room -The escape from Room.The film tries to put all of these plots into one piece, not focusing
on one in particular, which failed to engage me in the story at all.
There are also plenty of loose ends and unexplored characters that I
could go into, but I'd rather not.Overall, this film reminds me of Prisoners and Sicario. It's a story
that has potential, but seems like a first draft of a script. There are
too many subplots and not a core story that it focuses on, nor is there
a proper three act structure to draw the audience in. The performances
and production value is great, but other than that, I thought it was a
waste of my time.

Room, in my opinion an incredibly moving story of the relationship
between a young Son, 5 years old, and a Mother living in, for the
Mother, dreadfully stressful conditions. The acting in this movie, by
the principals, was superb, and I was totally stunned by the
performance of Jacob Tremblay as the Son; this show would be well worth
seeing if for nothing more than to see Jacob's performance. While
likenesses of the circumstances depicted in the film have come to light
in the real world in recent years, one feels that the Director may well
have touched very close to the emotions and feelings of the victims in
such situations I enjoyed to the utmost everything about the movie.

The scenario is interesting enough. A mother and her little son are
imprisoned for 7 years by a man in small shed halfway down his garden.
We think of the horrors experienced by similar victims publicized in
the media and we are immediately intrigued to learn more about this
phenomenon. But very sadly this film does not fulfill its potential. It
concentrates almost entirely on what appears to be a hackneyed feminist
agenda - namely the love of a mother for her son - rather than breaking
new ground and explaining to us how and why such things occur. In short
it leaves far more questions unanswered than it manages to solve.There are too many absurdities to list in this production.With only a single door between her and freedom it beggars belief that
the mother was not able to force it open or make her escape at the
moment it was opened. There was a skylight to the roof but in 7 years
she had not the ingenuity to smash it and escape. There were various
metal objects around the room and it would not have been impossible.The man enters the room and sleeps with her regularly. Indeed their
relationship seems quite calmly domestic. He does not need to force sex
upon her but they simply undress and relate as if normal husband and
wife. And both are able to sleep peacefully at night as if everything
was normal. She complains at the food and he tells her that he has no
work and struggles to keep them both. He buys presents for the boy and
seems reasonable normal and decent.It doesn't make any sense. Any man who would imprison a woman and child
in a tiny shed for 7 years must be insane. And yet every action of this
man is rational. And we are told nothing about the origins of the
story. How did her relationship with the man ever materialize? How long
after meeting did he imprison her? How did it ever happen? Instead of
covering this ground we are subjected to nearly two hours of thoroughly
predictable motherly behavior as if we could not imagine it ourselves.
Brie Larson executes the task quite competently but this was not an
Oscar winning performance. She merely left her Gucci gowns in the
closet, left her make up in the drawer and acted herself. Her award was
purely a boost to the underlying feminist message of the film.But the boy was something else. Jacob Tremblay dominated the film in
every way. His mood swings, his emotions, his play as a boy half his
real age and his capture of our imagination in every scene was nothing
short of masterful. Not only should he have been given the Oscar but
his performance illustrates the need to introduce a new category in the
annual ceremony: Best performance by a child actor. He certainly
deserved it.

Saw Room finally. Saw it because it had Oscar nominations and did not
really read about it before I went to see it. So I was lost watching it
first. I tried to understand why this woman and the child were so poor
and lived in a room which was bedroom, bathroom and kitchen and living
room and never seemed to go out. Slowly it dawned on me that they were
held captive by Old Nick and that the child had never seen the outside
world, but knew television and some books and stories told by his
mother. I was fascinated. Somehow the film succeeded in making me
identify with every character in that movie. I tried to imagine what I
would have done or thought if I would have been the mother, the child,
Old Nick, the grandmother and grandfather, the partner of the
grandmother . I loved the movie. I loved the performances. I loved how
it make me think and feel and imagine living in a world reduced to a
room . I loved the art the two captives were creating and the love they
had for each other. Some people obviously find this movie boring, I was
captivated from beginning to end. Awestruck really.

Based on the searing novel by Emma Donaghue, "Room" is a movie both
disturbing and compelling. For five-year-old Jack (amazing Jacob
Tremblay), Room is his home, a 11 x 11 foot shed where he was born,
after his teenaged mom (Brie Larson, in her Academy Award winning
role)was kidnapped, imprisoned and sexually assaulted daily by Old
Nick.Told from the little boy's point-of-view, Jack seems unaware that Room
is a prison. For Jack it is his home, a seemingly safe haven filled
with all he knows and with the security of the only parent he knows.
Jack's world is exclusively his Ma and Room. They share a bed, toilet,
bathtub, and old television. The only window is a small skylight. In
this sealed environment, Ma heroically tries to shelter Jack from their
circumstances: telling stories, creating toys from egg shells, and
weaving imagination into their daily routine. Room seems normal for
Jack since he knows nothing else. Read my entire review at:

Bridgers, and William H. Macy. Held captive for seven years in an
enclosed space, a woman (Larson) and her 5-year-old son (Tremblay)
finally gain their freedom, allowing the boy to experience the outside
world for the first time.-Room premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September 4, 2015 and
had a limited release in the United States on October 16, 2015. It was
nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director for
Abrahamson, Best Actress for Larson, and Best Adapted Screenplay for
Donoghue. Larson also won several awards, including the Academy Award,
BAFTA Award, Critic's Choice Award, Golden Globe Award, Independent
Spirit Award, and the Screen Actors Guild Award.--Critical reception: -Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives
the film a rating of 94%, based on 229 reviews, with an average rating
of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus states, "Led by incredible
work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, Room makes for an
unforgettably harrowing  and undeniably rewarding  experience."
Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 86 out of 100,
based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".-Eric Kohn of Indiewire stated, "Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob
Tremblay('s)... textured performances turn outrageous circumstances
into a tense and surprisingly credible survival tale." Richard Roeper
of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film "the most impressive piece of
filmmaking I've seen in 2015, and one of the best movies of the
decade." -The central performances of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay
have received critical acclaim. --Kyle Smith of the New York Post wrote
"The script (...) doesn't illuminate what kind of internal damage might
be wrought by being held prisoner for seven years: On-screen it simply
looks like Joy has a case of the sads."

RoomTo catch child abductors, the police should be staking out Home Depot's
sex-dungeon department.Unfortunately, the captor's enclosure in this drama was preexisting.Raised by his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), in a backyard shed belonging
to the man who abducted her when she was a teenager, five-year-old Jack
(Jacob Tremblay) is completely unaware of life beyond the room where
she and he are imprisoned.After a successful escape, the two try to acclimate to outside life.
This includes reconciling with Joy's now-divorced parents (Joan Allen,
William H. Macy) and dealing with the media's victim shaming.The most frightening yet life-affirming films in years, this
character-driven adaption of the novel will resonate with views, not
only for its brave performances, but also for Jack's alien-like
viewpoint of the world we take for granted.Ironically, the shut-ins discovered that everyone in the outside world
was being held captive in a virtual prison. Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

As a child as a result of a situation like Jack I can relate. The story
is powerful, emotional, and heartwarming. At its depth it's a simple
story of a moms love for her son, and the bond that they share. A story
that will always stand the test of time. Jack (Jacob Trembly) gives us an amazing performance. Kid actors are
hard to come by. And good ones are rare, and ones where the entire
story revolves around one is next to impossible. Jacob does an amazing
job as this kid who has no clue what the world is. Most kids can do an
OK job at acting a kid. But he is ten, he is obviously past this age.
But it's never a time they remember, so they have nothing to draw from.
That's what makes this performance impeccable, it's genuine creativity
at its absolute. Ma (Bri Larson) is outstanding. The only flaws I would have are just
nitpicking. There were some lines I didn't like how they were
delivered. But I'm not a Mom, I'm. It Ma, maybe that's how she talks.
The movie did a great job of putting us in the situation.I love the changing perspective. With seems focused on Ma, and others
just From jack. We get a carousel point of view that flows well. My one major complaint about this movie is it has a pretty cookie
cutter ending. It was a predictable ending and one that brought a close
that was to easy. This is the same ending as the book. But I wished the
author and director came up with a new ending. But it doesn't stop me
form giving it a perfect score. I love this movie, I love these

I'm glad I saw this.Positives:#1. Brie Larson gave a great performance#2. Jacob Tremblay delivered a fantastic performance. In my opinion,
that kid stole the entire show; every scene that Tremblay was in was
breathtaking#3. Acting was good all across the board#4. Cinematography was great#5. I became frustrated during certain scenes; I felt like I was right
there with the characters. I knew how the characters felt. I understood
where their emotions were coming from, it's all very powerful, tragic,
and sad#6. During the course of the movie, I felt moments of sadness, sorrow,
and joy#7 My eyes were glued to the screen during the entire run timeNegatives:#1. William H. Macy doesn't get enough screen timeHonestly, I have nothing bad to say about this movie.A child never truly understands the world around them. It's the parents
responsibility to nurture their children. Most people are products of
their environment. Learning always starts at home. What is the right
way and what is the wrong way of things. People only do what they think
is the right thing. Others may not see things the same way as others.
It all boils down to a persons perspective. In my opinion, don't try
and hide your children from the world, because eventually the world
will find them. You can protect your children and keep them away from
things that you believe are unsafe, there's nothing wrong with that,
however, make sure that you explain both sides of the coin thoroughly.
As I say, a child's mind is a terrible thing to waste. Children are our
future, their fragile, and their full of life. Don't poison or destroy
their minds because it may affect them mentally in the future. I truly
believe that children are more in touch with humanity than adults are.

Room (2015) is my favourite non blockbuster from last year. It's funny
because I watched it in 2016. Don't just think this is a normal indie
movie it's not. I was going in expecting to hate the movie and the boy
Jacob Tremblay. I was blown away by this movie. My emotional string was
pulled apart. I don't want to give much away (if you haven't seen it).
This movie was acted to perfection. Directed to perfection. Written to
perfection. Character was developed to perfection. It was paced to
perfection. The movie first half was perfect. It was so so good too
good for the second half in my opinion too good for the second half to
reach that height again. The second was maybe a little bit slower but
the story was so great that it is so much enjoyable. This movie was
beautiful not like The Revenant (2015) beautiful but it was indie
beautiful. Well done Brie Larson you got the Oscar and you are great.
Jacob Tremblay blew it out if the park. They had so much chemistry to
each other. My problem though is the second half. Other than that this
movie deserves your money go watch it.

Although less commercially driven, "Room" is to 2015 as "Gone Girl" was
to 2014: An acclaimed film based on an acclaimed book adapted for the
screen by the author that takes the viewer into deep, psychologically
troubling places. Obviously, "Gone Girl" is a mystery thriller with a
creepy darkness to it, while "Room" is more of a trauma study, but both
stories also center on fictional characters at the center of a huge
media story.Jack (Jacob Tremblay) lives in 'Room' with his Ma (Brie Larson). 'Room'
is all Jack has ever known, but after his fifth birthday, his mom
decides to try explaining to him the truth  there is a world outside
of 'Room' and they need to get out. Writer Emma Donoghue gives us this story through Jack's eyes as much as
possible, and director Lenny Abrahamson ("Frank") does an excellent job
flowing back and forth between Jack's idealistic view of 'Room' and the
dark, terrifying real-world circumstances of it, and he continues this
balance of perspectives in the film's very different post-'Room' second
half.That's where Larson comes in in a very complicated role, because
there's a tangible separation between the viewer and Ma, the adult who
has endured this trauma. In most cases, she would be the easier
character to relate to, but this is Jack's story. Larson has to
communicate an absolute roller coaster of emotions without the film
focusing a ton of attention on her. She succeeds in being easy to
relate to despite our lack of knowledge and insight into her character,
outside of the fact that she's undergone an unfathomable trauma.Tremblay doesn't give one of those child performances for the ages, but
his job as Jack is to evoke the child within all of us because he's a
child narrator/main character in a story for adults. He acts with
incredible authenticity, creating a connection with the audience so
effortlessly.Creating a connection that puts you in the shoes of the characters is
far and away what "Room" does best. From the performances to the
two-act story structure, Abrahamson works hard to envelop you, to
provide a sense of claustrophobia, and then rip it all away, leaving
you with a mixture of mental and emotional poignancy. Suddenly you
start looking at characters and situations with a refreshed emotional
perspective.This effect compensates a bit for the lack of an especially compelling
narrative in the second act (although one sequence in the film is
absolutely heart-stopping). Eventually, plot sort of gives way to study
and observation as we are left to sift through the emotional aftermath
and watch these characters cope."Room" is in the very least a showcase of several emerging talents in
front of and behind the camera, all of whom have big careers ahead of
them. There's a lot of great talent making great choices in this film,
and though lots of other independent films are equally worthy of
acclaim, it's nice to see something like "Room" get some major
recognition.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more

This is one of the most impressive movies I have ever seen. And it is
not easy to impress me. The genre is psychological drama but really it
is Not as anything you have ever seen. You know that you have something
special when everyone is telling you that you movie is good and unique.
The only movie i would relate it to as analogy- may be The Road. This
picture is all about a struggle that mother and her child have vs cruel
and constantly changing world. It is not actually about the abduction,
it is more about growing up and adjusting to new world. For both mother
and child. Despite the extreme circumstances of this story, it leaves
you asking yourself are you really ever ready for pressure of raising a
child? Dramaturgy here is maybe the best I have ever seen. Astonishing
work on psychology and writing it into a simple but impressive form.
Also incredible actors performance. You will shed a fair amount of
tears but it will leave you with a good feeling.

After finishing the book a mere couple days ago, I went to watch the
movie adaptation of Room.On the whole, I was very pleased with what they did with the story even
if, as usual, I prefer the book version. Some things just brought more
depth and realism to the characters.I felt this especially with Jack's transition to the real world.
Whereas in the book the boy felt terrified and in shock for most of the
time, in the movie it was almost as if he was just surprised and
curious, even if a bit shy. On the other hand, Ma didn't come across as
the huge role model as in the book, even selfish at times, which I
found very true to such a character's development.Pretty much all the characters were different in one way or the other,
which was OK for most except for Old Nick, as I felt he came across as
much too humane.At the end of the day, there are so many little details in the book
that make the experience so special and something else entirely. Also,
there's the fact that it is entirely told by Jack. You see everything
through his eyes and even when he is describing something completely
ordinary you have to stop and figure out what it is because he
describes it in such a different way. That can't really happen in a
movie, not to that degree, because you base what you are watching on
your own notions. He still narrates it from time to time so you can
appreciate it, just not on the same level.Considering all the difficulties involved in bringing this story to the
big screen, I feel it was a job very well done and definitely recommend
it, whether you have read the book or not. This is not a theme for the
faint-hearted and I felt it was handled with respect by the author and
now by the director. I am so happy that the author's input was taken in
so much account when making this movie. You can tell.The performances were breath-taking. I can't believe a little boy can
act like that, even if he was probably 8 or 9 years old at the time. I
have to admit I shed a few tears on more than one occasion. This is a
heart-warming and heartbreaking story all at once, just like the
book's.In a time when it seems so difficult to go to the movies and find
something special to watch, this one is definitely a pearl in the
middle of the ocean.

From womb to Room to tombLast week we saw the Oscar nominated film, Room, whose star Brie Larson
won best female actor. On its surface, it is obviously a story of
trauma, rescue, and recovery. A teen-ager in high school, Brie (Ma) is
kidnapped and held prisoner in a backyard shed. After two years, she
gives birth to a child (Jack) fathered by her captor/rapist. She raises him for five years, keeping him safe from her kidnapper, and
creates for Jack a belief in a world no bigger than the small area
contained within the shed's four walls, lit by a small skylight above.
Seven years after her capture, Brie and Jack get free and the second
half of the movie is their difficult integration into a new/old world
of family and society.I read the book a couple of years ago when it appeared on the Booker
Prize list, but the movie clarified for me central images and themes I
missed earlier. Room is, in fact, a contemporary retelling of Plato's
"allegory of the cave" and illustrates, as well, the process of
spiritual awakening from life to death to rebirth.Plato's uses the allegory to describe the depths of illusion and fear
that keep individuals clinging to their ignorance of reality. A group
of people are chained in the cave facing inward toward its wall. Behind
them is a fire. In front of them, but behind a curtain, other people go
back and forth carrying sticks with objects upon them that cast shadows
upon the wall.The prisoners mistake those moving images as reality, as Ma tells Jack
the characters on television are actually as flat and unreal as they
appear on the screen. To protect him, the only world she reveals to him
is the one they jointly create within the shed.Even when a prisoner is forced into the world outside the cave, he
resists opening his eyes. When he finally does he cannot accept the
objects in the sunlit world as real. Similarly, Jack does not believe
his mother when she first reveals to him the existence of a real world
he has never seen. Essentially, to make their escape, he must have
faith not only in her, but in an unseen reality outside Room.Jack's awakening or better yet his illumination is preceded by symbolic
death. Acting as if he is dead, he is wrapped in a carpet/shroud and
placed in a truck bed to cross into the next world. Peering through the
end of the red carpet, we can imagine Jack sees the strange sky and
light as an infant perceives what lies outside the birth canal.As in Plato's allegory, Jack has difficulty trusting the new people and
objects in his environment and expresses a wish to return to Room.
Wearing a face mask against possible infection and sunglasses, Jack has
difficulty negotiating the stairs that take him from one to another
level of his new reality.Jack's mother, however, did an extraordinary job within Room
maintaining his capacity for attachment, love, and curiosity. He shows
interest and empathy, for example, toward Mouse when he appears in
Room.Jack eventually begins a process toward individuation. His mother
finally rejects his wish to nurse and he accepts this. And when Ma
begins to experience the expected obstacles toward recovery following
the initial euphoria of rescue, he gives her a portion of his newly cut
5 year old hair to as a restorative sacrifice and symbolic offering of
help.Gradually with the help of the love and wisdom of his grandmother and
the patient tutelage of her companion, Leo, and Leo's dog, Jack is led
further from Room and the unconsciousness of his prior relation to Ma.
Jack is now, as Joseph Campbell would have it, a hero.I write this piece not simply for the intellectual pleasure it provides
me, but for its parallel to what is possible for us. From the loss of
the first taken for granted world of Ma when she was a teen, and for
Jack the loss of Room, the only world he has known, we can see
ourselves having to adjust multiple times to the changes wrought by the
progression of chronic illness . And if Jack and Ma can adapt and even
flourish in each strange and ever new world, so perhaps can we. And, of
course, we miss our former world, as Jack does Room, but then, as with
Plato's freed prisoner, we turn toward the light.

Given the disturbing premise of "Room", I was expecting emotional
intensity, a fairly static plot, and a generally dark tone, so I was
surprised to find this movie to be an engagingly-told story of
resiliency.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley are outstanding. Playing mother and
son, their characters and relationship are completely convincing, and
while the story starts fairly quietly (perhaps to reflect Joy's and
Jack's captivity), the story gains intensity as Joy realizes the need
to escape, and prepares Jack to help in the attempt.This is a story about trauma, survival, and resiliency, told very
quietly and carefully. I marvel at films that find the significance in
the everyday, without having to warp it for dramatic effect. "Room"
achieves it beautifully.

Jacob Tremblay was incredible. Despite what age he is, it was one of
the best performances I've ever seen. Such range in his performance,
and he maintained the innocence that his character holds which was what
made this movie so touching, creating moments of joy, amusement and
tears. Definitely should have been Oscar-nominated. Jack only knew a
life inside one room with one person. Watching how he experienced this
whole new world was captivating - opening up to new faces, walking on
different surfaces, seeing animals/trees/everything for the first
time... I think both actors portray very realistic and believable
performances of adjusting to this new life. It's a story of their
strong bond, how both give each other strength and courage. It was a
very emotional film - I cried several times throughout. It's definitely a film that will stay with you. Beautifully acted.
Emotional. A must-see movie. (Remember the tissues!)

I'm just gonna jump straight to it - be ready with tissues, and keep in
mind that similar events like this actually takes place out in the
world. WE need to remember how lucky we are just think of that the
next time you're complaining about what ever you're complaining about
(same goes for me, I need to stop complaining about the weather
situation..). This is not based on a true story thankfully. It's
heartbreaking but so good. And the Cast is one of the best I've seen in
a while. Brie and Jacob are just amazing, two really great actors, who
were meant for this film. Also kind of glad that they didn't focus on
showing us all these horrible experiences the mom (brie) has to go
through, I mean you know that they're happening, but what we get to see
is this strong mom fighting for her and her sons life and It's more
from Jacobs point of view which makes it more pleasant to watch. If
that makes sense I can't elevate this film, cast and crew enough. JUST
GO watch it already! Words to help describe this film: isolation,
escape, heartbreaking, breathtaking, lego, family.I absolutely loved it, a lot because of Brie and Jacob (and who am I
kidding- also the compelling story of course)I give it 10 out of 10

This is a movie that I wanted to see and at the same time knew it would
be hard to watch. And it was. The acting by Ma and Jack is so realistic
and has been rewarded so many times for Brie Larsen. Jacob Trembley
deserves more awards but I look forward to seeing this young man again
and again. To put a story of a woman who is kidnapped at 17, and has a
child, and finds a way to get him out of the Room - on the screen could
not have been easy. The ability of Ma to keep Jack curious, to teach
him, and protect him - to well presented. The script is so good. You
are presented the aftermath of the events and they are presented with
such probable truth. To go back to a world that is different that you
had at 17 and then a 5 yr. old being able to experience it for the
first time - well done. I am glad I saw it - wish I had seen it when it
first can out - but will never forget this film.

(spoilers) Directed with competence and subtlety by Lenny Abrahamson,
"Room" is winning direction with good score and great acting from
leads, especially Jacob Tremblay (young Jack). The claustrophobia of
the first 45 min wears a bit, but the filmmakers redeem themselves with
an excellent 2nd half of adaptation and re-circulation into society.
Camera angles, brightness, and blurriness, including sound muffling are
all masterfully distorted and adjusted to impart the strange distress
the boy gets put through when transitioning. The dialog is not
far-fetched or pandering. Indeed, the movie was very good, adapted from
the novel with the same author creating the screenplay as well. 7.5/10
(recommended)

From the first moment I started watching this film, it caught my full
attention. The story line is so powerful and vulnerable at the same
time I couldn't help but thinking this is one of the best films I've
seen in the last year or two. What I found most enchanting personally
was the connection Ma' and Jack had throughout the entire film. The
world Ma' had created for Jack to grow into despite her own tragic fate
was beyond words. But what really broke me is the second part of the
film, when both are free and out in the real world again. That's when
emotions start hitting Ma' the way they should all those years she
stayed strong for Jack in Room. The suicide attempt for me was the peak
of the story! The chemistry between Brie and Jacob on and off set is
undeniable. The two of them created something so strong, and pure and
sincere, I think that was the main reason this film got so far, and
people got so stunned. I recommend it for anyone who is up to an
emotional, powerful experience. MAGNIFICENT FILM FOLKS!

Lenny Abrahamson's Room is poignant. Room is evocative. Room is
devastatingly beautiful. There is a magic in creating a world in a
child's perspective. To capture and display the innocence, the purity,
the sheer amount of confusing vastness of the world is no mean feat.
Writer Emma Donoghue, who is also the writer of the book that the film
is based upon, and director Lenny Abrahamson manage to do just that.The film starts with the pair of mother and son, Joy and Jack, played
by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay living their lives while scrapping
for resources yet finding solace in each other's company, in a room.
That is right. In a single room (which later revealed to be a garden
shed with a skylight as the only source of sun). The reason behind this
ordeal revealed to be that Joy had been abducted by person referred
only as 'Old Nick'. Old Nick kept Joy and Jack, who is his biological
son, sans any means of communication with the outside world and had
them live a life devoid of any hope to go back to the world.Without revealing much about what happens next in the film, it can be
said that what follows is one of the heart-wrenching and heart-warming
story about love, innocence and those little joys of the world that we
often overlook. There is a slight tonal shift in the second half as the
tension of escape and sweetness of the love between mother and son gets
replaced with Joy facing the reality of the world. But the change is in
coherence with the story and that helped in underlining the difficulty
both protagonists, especially Joy, is facing in their new world. Even
without reading the book, I must say that the screenplay immensely
helped in establishing the dichotomy of the emotions that the
protagonists went through. Lenny Abrahamson's direction complemented
that aforementioned dichotomy. The first act was shot quite
meticulously in the closed room, thus providing a sense of foreboding
and an urge for escape.Although bolstered by a good support cast the film largely centers
around the mother, played by Brie Larson and the son, played by Jacob
Tremblay. Brie Larson, whose hitherto best performance perhaps had been
in the largely underrated 2013 film Short Term 12, churned out a
superlative and breathtaking performance as the mother. The role was a
delight for an actor of her capability and she made the character her
own. Restrained and gritty while being captive in the room and yet
lovingly playing with her son; Vulnerable and fragile, being captive of
her own thoughts and insecurities, while trying to get her son attuned
to the big world; Brie Larson shines throughout her role.But, the film would not have been so pure, so emotional, so magical
without the brilliant performance of Jacob Tremblay, as the 5 year old.
It is one of the finest performances from a child I have ever seen. The
fear of the task her mother asked, then the taste of freedom, then
again the intimidation of the vast world that had hitherto been unknown
to him. We feel everything through the wondrous performance of Jacob
Tremblay and he genuinely smiled in the film when seeing a 'real' dog
for the first time, it becomes difficult to hold tears back.At this point, it would not be fair if Stephen Rennick's score is not
mentioned. The music, with the appropriate usage, bolstered the scenes
and helped the film in taking the audience for the ride.Room is a film that would provide its audiences a perspective that we
often ignore; and for this very reason it is a film that should not be
missed.

I got curious about this after I heard about Larson's Oscar for the
role. The story is well told and intimately enveloped  both inside the
room, as they cope and survive, and outside, as they adjust to a
normalized life  and it has its moment of prisoner poetry, but it
keeps it light on the drama strings as it filters the heaviness of
psychological anguish through the prism of a 5-yr old boy. This could
be seen as properly measured, of course, and preferable to most
viewers, but I'd expect a more incisive and explorative recount, with
all the squalor and darkness such abuse and rehabilitation would
entail, before the opening to a new life. One also wonders about the
missed chances of making enough noise to be noticed, and I spotted an
obvious stylistic error in the camera vehicle's shadow as it follows
the captor's truck. The kid was pretty good.

The year 2015 was probably the biggest year for movies ever. There were
so many amazing movies that were released in 2015, and Room tops them
all. I would go as far to say the Room is the greatest movie ever made,
in my opinion at least.First of all, the acting was absolutely amazing all the way around,
especially Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Brie Larson
gave one of the best performances by an actress that I have ever seen
and in return took home the Oscar for Best Actress. At only 9 years
old, even Jacob Tremblay gave an amazing performance. I honestly think
he should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor,
despite his age. Overall, I don't think the movie could have been cast
any better than it was.Throughout the whole two hours of this movie, I was glued to my TV.
There are very few movies that have ever had my attention like Room
did. No other movie has made me feel so sad, happy, stressed, and
relieved all at once. In fact, before watching Room, I had never in my
life cried over a movie or TV show, but that changed when I watched
Room.If you have not seen this movie yet then I highly recommend that you
do. However, I would suggest that you do not watch the trailer because
I feel the trailer gives away too much.

This movie was breathtaking. I wouldn't have been surprised if the movie had been just about the
time spent in Room with an escape finale (the typical on this subject),
but being able to get a glimpse of life outside hell from more than one
perspective, made the movie complete. I've read the reviews that said
the movie is about nothing. It's true. It's about nothing but inner
struggle, nothing but constant moving on, nothing but parental
worries&strategies&love, nothing but inner conflicts, nothing but life.
So it's not the movie that lacks depth, you just need your own personal
depth to relate.

***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT***Sooooo...I stayed up late last night watching the movie "Room". Brie
Larson won the Oscar for Best Actress for this movie, and the plot
seemed like it might have potential. I guess now would be a good time
to say once again...***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT*** If you don't want to know why I
didn't like this movie very much then you should stop reading now.Brie Larson was pretty great, and the little kid was even better
especially his narrative parts. The movie had plenty of touching
moments, no doubt. I mean, even I couldn't keep the water works from
flowing when mother and son were re-united in the back of that police
car. Sadly, the main issue with this movie is that it peaks in the
middle, and the last 58 minutes of the movie is filled with a bunch of
useless drivel and irritating performances by some pretty decent actors
(Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Wendy Crewson). Lit'rally, there was one
seen that irritated me so bad that I wanted to reach thru my TV screen
and smack someone. It's a scene where a "better-than-you" talk show
host asks the mother if during any part of the seven years they were
held captive if she ever thought of sending the boy away to a hospital
or a shelter so that he could have a chance at a normal life. I just
wanted the mother to say something like, "Hey, ya dimwit, do you even
know what was going on? The guy had us locked in a soundproof shed with
an electronic keypad lock on the door for SEVEN YEARS!!! The only way
to "send my son away" would have been to send him with said abductor
who probably would've just as soon slashed my son's throat and left his
body in a dumpster than to risk having someone find him out because he
was trying to give my son a chance at a NORMAL life!!"But, unfortunately, those lines were never spoken. The other detraction from this movie is that it doesn't take too long
to realize that once the movie peaks that it's not going to have a
succinct, defined ending. It was just a matter of waiting to see what
scene the director decided to end it on. It could have ended a half
hour sooner, or it could have played on for two more hours, but there
was just no way to wrap it all up in a nicely wrapped package.Yeah, usually I like it when a movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood
ending...but not when you can see it coming from 35 kilometers away. In
the end I give "Room" 4 out of 10 stars; two for Brie Larson and two
for her son. Everything else in the movie is just pure, unadulterated
nonsense.RECOMMENDATION: Check out Spotlight instead. It won Best Picture for a
reason.

Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and is the story of a woman named
Joy (Brie Larson), who was kidnapped and imprisoned in a woodshed for 7
years. While living there, she had a son named Jack (Jacob Tremblay),
who sees their "house" in a different perspective than that of his
mother. Jack has never seen the outside world, and believes that there
is nothing beyond their room; just outer space. This film follows the
two as they plan a daring escape, and have to face something much
bigger than their room; the world.To start, the Academy was smart to nominate Room for best picture. This
movie is a masterpiece. It's one of the best films of the year, and
it's very close to being the best. Room, while being a different story,
is amazing. The plot and dialogue is absolutely perfect. There's no a
thing wrong with the plot (no holes), and nothing wrong with the
dialogue, either. The directing was also amazing. The way the directing
makes a tiny room seem as big as the universe is fantastic.The acting was definitely the best part about the entire movie, and
that's saying something. Jacob Tremblay is only 9 years old, and
delivered one of the best child actor performances in cinema history. I
honestly think this kid will land many more roles, and continue to give
us even performances, just like this one, or maybe even better, though
that doesn't seem possible. Brie Larson also does great in her role.
She plays a conflicted woman, going through something she doesn't
understand astoundingly. Every line that she gives is truly
astonishing.Now, although the movie's great, there are a couple negatives. They are
nitpicky, yes, but they're negatives. The first one is that of William
H. Macy's performance as Joy's father. Not only is the performance
pretty bad, the character isn't the greatest either. Macy's character
is not ready at all to handle the return of his daughter, let alone
that she has a son. Luckily, this character is only in the film for 10
minutes or so.The only other negative is that the film moves a bit slow, mostly in
the second act. The first act can drag a little, but the second act
moves pretty slowly. The second act takes place after Jack and "Ma"
escape, and their getting home and used to life in the world. This
seems to take much longer than it really is, and that slows the movie
down a little. However, it's not enough to make the movie bad, or even
not amazing. Not nearly enough.Overall, Room is one of the best films of the year, and it definitely
deserves an A, or a 9 out of 10.

Sometimes living in enclosed space able your mind to open up to wider
thoughts. The whole film is from the perspective of 5 years old boy
Jack, who'd been living whole his life in an enclosed room since he had
born. It is when, as the film progresses, he starts comparing his
previous life in enclosed imaginative world in the room than to the
open real world. His little comparisons will blow up your mind. The
tale about unconditional love of mother and son & how they balance each
other, is one of fewer films which should be watched as little knowing
about it before. And, the film gonna stay with you for long.Acted top-notch by both the leads. Brie Larson brilliantly played the
mother with a heart of cotton. Jacob Tremblay will just steal your
heart with his ease. The most wonderful thing about the film is that
how the director have chosen it to be shot, mostly with the eyes of the
little boy. Trust me sometimes you'll just feel in the seat of that
boy. Without been preachy & forcing any ready-made thoughts on you, the
film forces to think and let you feel about many of things. Some
moments in the film are so soulful that if you didn't have shed your
tears during that, you'd probably lost your heart somewhere, better
start searching before it's too late. It is just personal opinion that
the director should have showed or conveyed more through the mouth &
heart of Jack, may be I was craving for more thoughts.I think this movie will be experienced differently by every individual
depending on how he/she feels the emotions, the bond, the world. The
true fact is, there's too much to learn from the character of Jack.

Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, Garage) and stars Brie
Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen & William H. Macy. Based on the best-selling novel; Room explores how 5-year-old Jack
copes with the huge world surrounding him after escaping the 10-by-10
foot enclosure that kept he and his mother captive his entire life. With tour de force performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay,
this psychological drama triumphs in a story of survival, hope and the
unbinding love between mother and son. With award season in full swing,
Room has captured audiences around the world, with its small and subtle
storytelling and gargantuan directorial vision. The attention this film
has gained is so vast and wonderful to see, focusing on the
performances of our two on-screen protagonists. I'm truly glad to see
Larson taking the Oscar for best actress and Tremblay for the AFCA
breakthrough artist. Both are equally magnificent as their chemistry
flows beautifully throughout the 128 minute running-length of the film.After seeing Abrahamson's directional efforts in 'Frank' and hearing
that he was sitting back in the directors chair for Room, I knew I had
to see it. His work is highly regarded as some of the best Irish cinema
around. I can safely say, I agree. Truly enduring work, and the pacing
never holds up even for a few moments.Stephen Rennicks pairs up with Abrahamson yet again with their fifth
collaboration and it sounds incredible. The soft guitar melodies play
slowly and gently under the performances and perfectly portray the mood
and themes of this film, then as the drama and tension increases, a
structured string movement thickens the emotional core. I'd love to see
the two connecting again sometime in the future. I have very little to say that would be derivative of the overall
feature and because of this, I have to say I'm very happy with the
experience I have had with this film. I think Abrahamson is an
ingenious director and really strives to be different.My verdict; Room is a film that everyone should watch and take note of.
A simple idea can go a long way. This is substantial proof of that. Room, 9/10.

Ever since I've been following the Award season, I was wondering what
was exactly about this 'Jacob Tremblay' kid. I had never heard about
him, but the more awards nominations he got, the more pictures of
"Room" I was discovering, the more intriguing that skinny pale-looking
child with unusually long hair was, especially that movie snapshot of
his stunned look crossing as you could tell he was witnessing something
of hypnotic beauty.First, I thought Tremblay was portraying some kind of autistic kid,
then the story of a mother and her child trapped in a room made me
expect a movie about confinement, and the ability of creating a world
out of a horrible situation. And the kid looked strange enough to make
me believe that he was victim of a condition forcing him to be
isolated. Lenny Abrahamson's "Room" was the kind of film that is
surrounded by an aura of mystery, but that alone wouldn't have been
enough without the whole awards-buzz, so like many others, I saw it to
see what was good about it.At first, I was disrupted by the whole voice-over narration, I wasn't
really ready for some abstraction à la "Tree of Life", and I wished the
kid wouldn't be too strange, even within the story's strangeness. But
doubts immediately vanished, Jack was a normal kid who loved to play,
to please his mother Joy, played by Brie Larson, to be told that he's
grown up, to write, to draw, except that everything he does, and been
doing since he was born, took place in that small shed, whose only door
to the world is a skylight. And as the story goes, we get the
circumstances of their presence there, especially when there's a sort
of figure named Old Nick who's the only known outsider.The film echoes many news items about women or kids who've been
abducted for years and years, being raped and having children with
their own captor, the kind of stories that make you wonder how can
anyone survive from such conditions. It's the mark of great films not
to answer questions directly but to make you answering them on your
own. Jack, unlike Joy, doesn't know what he missed and the whole world,
as far as he's concerned is the room and whatever is in the room is
real. A mouse is real, a spoon or a kitchen sink or a wardrobe are
called by 'mister' or 'mrs' but whatever appears in that box named TV
is made of pictures and can't count as real. And as far as humanity
goes, there's him, his mother and Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers.Jack can't be unhappy or his unhappiness is limited to his world.
However, his mother spent only 7 years of her life there; she not only
knows what she's missing but she knows damn well what Jack is missing.
And if Jacob Tremblay deserves the praise for his performance, there's
something in Larson's acting that cuts straight to the heart. She is
devastated but she must hide it,, the presence of Jack is the only
thing that keeps her alive, otherwise, she would have killed herself.
Jack is her skylight. But there comes a point where enough is enough,
and for his own good, she can't let Jack drown in a fantasy-world that
might eventually destroy him. This is a story of a mother's
responsibility, and she's got to stop pretending and get her son out of
there.She first thinks of faking illness so Nick can take Jack to the
hospital but instead of that, Nick goes outside to buy antibiotics. She
then teaches Jack how to play dead, so she can wraps him under a carpet
and ask Nick to 'bury' him, this is where Jack must free himself. They
say even a frail mother can increase tenfold her strength if her child
is in danger, the same goes when Nick wants to check the body. Joy
learned how to fake emotions, but now, she has to make it
'Oscar-worthy' so that Nick is convinced not only to take the body but
not to bury him in the garden and take him on his truck. Joy keeps her
head on the carpet not to let anything betray her nervousness, and the
plan works. I guess there's a justice if Larson wins the Oscar if only
for that scene where she gave her best acting in order to forever stop
acting after that, the climax of her room years of pretension.And a lesser film would have made it the real 'climax', and make "Room"
a sort of mother-and-son version of "Life is Beautiful" with a
heart-warming slow-motion reunion at the end, people crying and some
cheerful happy-ending music but "Room" is respectful enough to our
intelligence not to tell us that everything will go perfectly right
after such an experience. The second act consists on Joy and Jack
coping with their trauma, and building new relationship with family
members who's either strangers or estranged to their world. "Room"
isn't about people stuck in a room during seven years, but stuck in the
world after such experience, and this time, it's harder for Jack.Indeed, I finally saw what was beyond that picture, Jack had a stunned
'where am I?' born-baby look, with his vision blurred because of the
years spent in obscurity, he was reborn, but life will go very fast for
him. One day, he'll ask his grandmother (Joan Allen) to cut his hair (a
vivid symbol of "Room" days, his Samson-like 'strength' as Joy told
him) and this action ironically makes him even stronger, and is a
positive signal for Joy. Then they visit the room again and Jack
realizes how small it was, just as when we visit a childhood place. He
didn't grow much physically after the "Room" but he could finally enjoy
life now that he discovered how wonderfully big it was.

Prepare to cry, to feel, to be angry, and to cheer. This is one of
those kind of films that will stays with you long after the credits
roll. It's captivated. Not to confused with the awful bad, 2003's The
Room, 2015's Room is an admittedly unsettling adaptation, based off,
the novel by author Emma Donoghue of the same name. Room tells the
story about two people: 5-year-old Jack Newsome (Jacob Tremblay) and
his Ma, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) living together in a single room.
Told from Jack's point of view, the movie makes it clear that he's used
to the idea of never going outside. What the audience knows that Jack
doesn't know, is that he and his mom are prisoners, by a serial rapist,
named Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). Now, on Jack's 5th birthday, Ma must
finally tell him, the truth, so that they can siege the dangerous and
heart breaking opportunity for her and Jack to escape. Can Jack cope
with the decision of life outside of his own four walls; or will the
room continue to be, his inner sanctum? Watch the movie to find out!
Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, Room really hit
close to home. I had known people that went through similar trauma like
this. While, this movie is hard to watch, it's a movie that needed to
be seem, as it shows how to cope with the rest of your life after going
through life changing event like sexual, mental, and physical abuse.
Indeed, there is something worth discovering, outside, beyond these 4
walls. The movie is beautifully acted. Brie Larson is a tour de force.
By far, one of the best acting of my generation, I have saw from an
actress in recent times. You feel the love, angry, and dramatic
heartbreak in every scene, she is in. After all, she essentially missed
out on her formative adult years and was forced instead to raise a
child in inhospitable conditions. You sense every emotional range of a
mother whose young life was drastically altered at age 17. Not only
that, but Larsen, well-mastered acting gives strong testament to the
unsinkable bond between a mother and son, whose love propels them to
rescue each other. I have to give credit to the young Jacob Tremblay,
as well. Tremblay, in particular, is mesmeric. He has a lovable charm
about him. I really felt like he was a son, I never knew, I had. That's
how close, I got with his character. Both Larson and Tremblay make a
remarkable duo. Another thing, I love about the film, is how accuracy
closed, it was, to the source material. Screenwriter, Emma Donoghue
didn't change much of anything from her novel. Inspired by real-life
kidnapping cases like the Fritzl case, & the Jaycee Lee Dugard case,
author Emma Donoghue was able to use symbolism, themes, and metaphors,
from both real-life news, and classic literature to make a very
well-written film. I love all, the references to Count of the Monte
Cristo, Alice in Wonderland, and the Book Thief. Not only that, but all
the Religious symbolism ranging from Sampson's hair to the villain,
being called Old Nick, help make the character development of Jack,
being told here, very believable. If the movie had any fault about
Jack's story, it's the fact that many viewers were confused by, Jack's
appearance. He had very long hair and very soft voice. Because of this,
there has been elaborate and incorrect theories speculating that Joy is
pretending that Jack is boy, to hide it from her captor. While the
first half of this film was entertaining, it still lacked a lot of
logic. Like, why didn't they just smash the window and climb out using
their table and chairs? Also, how come Old Nick didn't see Jack when he
was sitting straight up in the truck? Why would Old Nick just drop Jack
like that? Those are really big jarring questions. If you think about
it, it's something worth debating about. Thinking outside of the box.
Another fault of the film is how it does feel a bit disjointed. It's
kinda like watching two different movies. Filmed in two parts; the
first half, is learning to survive and escape, your torment hell.
While, the second half is learning to cope after the trauma has
happened. Yes, I know, a lot of critics might think the second half,
might had gone a little too long, and repetitive, but I believe, the
movie is well-paced. After all, you rarely see films tackle character
study after a horrible event. This was something new to me. Another
person that deserve some credit, is director, Lenny Abrahamson and
cinematographer, Danny Cohen. The movie is well-shot. I love the scenes
where they showing time has changed. A good example is how the camera
focus on, the skylight of the room. Another great shot, is the whole
rug sequence. Wow, that was really intense. In my opinion, while, this
movie is Rated R. I didn't see anything that was graphic. Most of the
rape scenes, were not shown, and the film had no nudity. Even the
violence, was tame. If anything, it's just the dark subject matter.
However, I saw harsher films rated PG-13 that dealt with a similar
concept. So I don't get, why this movie was Rated R. It makes no sense
to me. Overall: This haunting and disturbing movie is amazing. Worth
the price, checking out. I hope, many success for it, during Oscar
season.

The crime of kidnapping and extended captivity is well known through
media exposure that sensationalises the psychological horrors of
confinement in claustrophobic spaces. The dependency of some victims on
an abusive captor or prison is just one of the many strange twists
found in captivity stories. But this one is different because it is
narrated through the eyes of five- year old Jack who was born in a
fortified shed with only a small overhead skylight visually connected
to what is outside his world called Room. His mother was abducted at
seventeen and has been a captive for seven years, raising Jack as best
she can in a co-dependent relationship that shines beautifully in their
small prison. When tormentor Nick loses his job she knows he will not
keep them alive, and that's when the slow-paced narrative opens
predictably towards a fast world full of frighteningly wonderful sights
and sounds and feelings expressed through the naivety of a newborn
five-year old.This film would not work without the emotionally intelligent acting of
Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Being almost ten and convincingly presenting as
half his age is nothing short of remarkable. He describes his new world
through wide eyes and lyrical words that capture the exploding space
into which he is thrust, and he alone holds this film together. As Ma,
Brie Larson's acting fixates on maternal dynamics at the cost of a
convincing portrayal of captivity trauma. The scene where Jack and Ma
re-visit Room after Nick is caught has all the nonchalance of strolling
through a museum, as the story winds down from the highs of a taut
psychological thriller to a modest melodrama. It is after all a film
that strives for insight, not entertainment, while remaining true to
the book upon which it is based. It does this thoughtfully in the first
half, but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.

I never write reviews but rarely do my opinions disagree with the IMDb
top 250 so greatly so I wanted to explain myself.Room has probably the highest production value of any movie. That being
said, it primarily takes place in a shack and inside a house. That
being said, it probably cost around 5 million to make. So high marks
there. I must mention is has perfect acting. H Macy, Bree, that kid,
everyone, congrats. But in my opinion, perfect production value (script, camera, acting,
directing, location, art dept, etc) does not mean the movie is perfect.It's how the production value works together as a living entity. For
instance, Star Wars has inconsistent production value, yet it is still
watched today. That is because the bad and good production value come
together and create an entity. A movie.In Room, all the production value does not make a great movie. I leave
the movie feeling empty and destroyed. I leave hating the cinema if
that is the best cinema has to offer. I digress, the movie needed to be told in a non linear way to make it
more tasteful with about half of it being cut and replaced with
something else. While I'm sure this is quite tasteful as a book, as a
film, I don't want to see a women getting rapped in front of her son 8
times and nether should you.This leads me to conclude that the academy, critics and many IMDb users
are sociopaths. Or simply, nitpickers whom only care about production
value. The level of this dastardly accusation I have just come up with is
proportional to the rate I disagree with critics, IMDb users, academy
with a +/- 2 point buffer in regards to our respective ratings of this
movie. I give this a 5.4.This means I may be right in this conclusion: Cinema is not safe. But than again, it probably never was.

Room creates an impact as it starts with the mother and her son, within
the confinement, that within a short time we are taken into their
world. Not stressing much on the saddening prison-ed part, it quickly
packs up and move into the reformation side of two soon up to happy
ending.It remarkably acknowledges all the possible issues that should arise in
various individual situation both are put into. One doesn't think of
beyond because he has never experienced it, all the facts mentioned to
him suddenly are fake and story for him. With time he realize the
possibility of possibility.Satisfying performance of Brie and Jacob is worth noticing. The movie
is courageous, powerful, questioning, emotional, agitating, disturbing
and one of its kind

I really enjoyed Room, Room had the ability to create a sense of
suspense within a 'room'. A sense of mystery, I was quite interested in
the idea of this 'room' which if thought about is quite a bizarre idea.
As it did occur to me that it is quite strange that a man had kidnapped
a minor and proceeded to keep her alive in his shed, eventually
impregnating her and continue to pay for all expenses of her and this
child. All in all, despise the odd premises it is an intriguing story on
coping with the outside world. For "Ma", someone who has experienced it
but has been detached from it for several years and "Jack",one who has
never been a part of it. I do believe that Jacob Tremblay's portrayal
of the boy Jack was quite well done, I was sold at his bewilderment of
seeing the outside world and the impacts that has been inflicting on
him after being exposed to the false belief that the room is
everything. It's got this whole idea of new things versus the old familiar things
and the idea of the fear of new experiences. It also deals with the
problem of post traumatic stress on Brie Larson's "Ma" and her trying
to cope with the world despite her experiences of potential rape and
having been kidnapped for such a long time. It is clear that there is a
disconnect which brings viewers to the next theme of a sense of
belonging and fitting in. Overall I do recommend it for people who like films with more thinking
required but this is definitely not your average popcorn flick.

Room opens on Jack's world on his 5th birthday. To him, the universe is
as expansive as the four walls he knows. Jack's mother known simply as
Ma (Brie Larson) is driven by one mission in her life, to shield him
and protect him from the true and harsh realities of their life in
spite of the harrowing circumstances.I first heard about the book Room through a friend. She told me the
concept and I was immediately intrigued and quickly added it to my Need
to Read pile. But it had the reverse effect when I heard there was
going to be a film adaptation. I was concerned how the distinct style
and voice would transfer over. The wisest decision filmmakers and A24
made was to have the book's author Emma Donoghue also write the
screenplay for her bestselling novel. Her faithfulness to the original
source is unmatched and her expertise in expanding upon the literature
for film should be a basis for all future movie adaptations of novels.For those unaware of the subject matter, Room is about a young woman
being held by her kidnapper. She has been there for some time, long
enough to have a five year old son named Jack. She creates a wondrous
life for him in the confines of that 10×10 room in an effort to protect
him from the horrors of their situation so may grow to be a happy
child. What we the audience see is this life and the effect Jack's
curiosity has on Ma, spurring a desire to escape to the outside.The beauty of Room lies in its unique perspective and distinct
mechanism through which it chooses to tell the story of its two
characters, through the eyes and mind of a five year old child. In that
regard, it is awe inducing. In doing that, a film about several
different simultaneous traumas is bearable when in reality it should be
like living in a raw nerve. And still, the harrowing emotions these
characters go through is palpable, going through the screen straight
through your soul. There is a constant tension and quiet terror to
Room, an anxiety that leaves you restless, wriggling in your seat as
you desire to help the characters. I was left nauseous, an amazing feat
given how restrained the film is and how perilous it may have been in
someone else's hands other than Lenny Abrahamson. He showcases the two
sides of this story, inside and outside Room, with balanced finesse and
an artist's eye and accomplishes a film that is both tender and
terrifying without being far-fetched or jarring.You really can't talk about Room without talking about its two stars:
Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Both of whom give outstanding
performances with the former perhaps having the luck of earning the
role of her career. With as many complex layers to the film as it has,
it rarely resorts to telling and virtually relies entirely on the
actors' performances and the audiences' abilities to observe minute
details. The character of Ma is strong, vulnerable, traumatized,
scared, desperate, hopeful, and angry, along with scores of other
gentler emotions and Larson does it with a quiet grace and inherent
awareness of her craft. Her commitment to the character is so honest
that there is no Brie Larson.You may not be ready for the intense subject matter of Room, and that
is okay, but we implore you to give it a chance. Room is one of those
films that will touch your soul and feel for your fellow man.Please check out the site for Archon Cinema Reviews for full reviews of

this is a story when the extreme turns to normal, when all hope is lost
and the only option is to cope with the horrors of life, and how one
can suffer dealing with the normal again when the Weights are lifted
off the shoulders.this is how good a mature story can get when told by a five-year old
boy, with a five-year old perspective, sad, tragic, deeply emotional
and very very profound.but to think this story is the real life of someone real about whom we
know nothing, gives you a feeling of depression and sorrow that you
would't shake off very easily.

I can't list out all the things, I love about this movie as it would
violate the spoiler rule of IMDb. But I'll try to describe as much as I
can. The movie starts, giving you an insight into the small world of
Jack, who is now five years old. He lives with his mom. He has a very
different concept of the world and people compared to us. The story
unfolds and you realize their condition. The escape scene can give you
chills and it was one of the best scenes of the movie. They adapt to
the normal life of the outside, and it doesn't turns to be easy for
them. But they carry on, and Jack who is learning the ways of the new
World, that he has found, makes some amazing discoveries which can
bring tears of joy to the common adult. Brie Larson portrays her role
very well. The performance by Jacob Tremblay, who played Jack, was
amazing too.

Giving meaning to tragedy and trauma is dangerous ground. Whether
you're a preacher, a writer, a journalist, a film-maker or just
somebody trying to walk alongside someone experiencing trauma, the
traps are the same. Say too much and you risk the trite, the trivial,
the weightless; say too little and you risk a silence which is filled
by worst imaginings. Try to find meaning and you flirt with missing the
point, not doing justice to the pain; try to let events speak for
themselves and you come close to nihilism. There's so much that can go
wrong it's best to do nothing if you don't have to, if events don't
force themselves on you. Trauma is distant to most of us But as I found
out when my when friend was murdered by terrorists, that approach is
ultimately of no use; sometimes the worst case happens, the unthinkable
becomes your daily concern, the unimaginable your lived experience. This is the territory we are in with Room, the film adaptation of Emma
Donoghue's massively successful novel (an adaption written by the
novelist). I had little knowledge of the book personally, but the
film-makers want us to be in no doubt as to where this film goes - the
bare facts make this a hard sell. It's the story of a young woman
(faultlessly played by Brie Larson) confined in one room for seven
years where she's repeatedly raped by her captor; she inhabits the room
with her five-year old son to whom she gave birth in the room as a
result of the rapes. Jack's world is the world in four walls; it's all
he's ever known, all he's ever seen save for what he sees through the
single window in the form of a skylight and the television. This is a
child's eye view film; it is through him we perceive the abuse which we
never see; it's through him we learn of his mother past life on the
outside; it's with him that we eventually journey to the outside world
in the film's final third. Jack's mum has helped him create a fantastical world within the four
walls of his existence; around his fifth birthday she tries to explain
the outside world to him. He's disbelieving, but gradually grasps
towards something resembling truth. When he attempts to affect their
escape he's just about aware enough to cope with the revelation that
there are other people and animals and places. We know there are real-world equivalents to this fictional story, but
still this film is trying to imagine the unimaginable. By all rights it
should be inadequate or trite or tasteless or just plain unbelievable.
In trying to make a film that isn't a thriller or a drama or comedy but
instead a hymn to love and relationships, the film-makers should be
falling flat on their faces. Instead they've given us a genuinely
unforgettable, overwhelming and transcendent film that helps us
rediscover ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us. It finds
beauty in the desperately ordinary thanks to some remarkable
cinematography that makes the small room both a place of captivity and
a universe to discover; the relationships are perfectly drawn and
life-affirming thanks to Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's (the son,
Jack) achingly beautiful performances. The depths of their relationship
are unfathomable yet also utterly recognisable to anyone who has ever
loved. The startlingly brilliant music haunts, prods, pushes and
finally engulfs. We never see the rape or abuse take place, but we're
left in no doubt as to its reality, its inescapability. Yet we're never
without hope or beauty, and ultimately the film lets us and the
characters find life in new, beautiful and subtle ways. There's much to say about Room, but at the end of the day there's
little I can properly articulate. I can think of maybe one other film
(Pan's Labyrinth - in many ways very different, in others very similar)
that has come close to making me feel as moved, alive, tearful and full
of wonder as this one. It's a rare work of art that leaves you
speechless yet desperate to talk, but Room is one of them.

I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than the second. Jack and
his mother's time in Room was captivating. I was intensely interested
in their relationship and way of life, trapped in such a tiny
enclosure. During their attempts to escape, I was kept on the edge of
my seat in suspense. Jack's first time seeing the real world was
magical and terrifying at the same time. I couldn't even imagine the
sensory overload. Then they both arrived at Jack's grandmother's house. Events here
seemed to unfold choppily. There was no clear direction. Before, Jack
and Ma's goal was to escape Room. Now, they were simply living
day-to-day, trying to adjust and readjust to the real world. This was
something they didn't handle gracefully, which was unsurprising after
all they went through. Room is an impressive filmone I won't likely forget. The acting is
stellar.

Room is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time and totally
deserving of all the award attention that it has been getting.The performances of both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are excellent.
Brie Larson really succeeds to show the fear and desperation that
Joy/Ma felt. There are parts where she seems so tired and exasperated
and I thought that it was a spot on reaction for someone in her
position. Jacob Tremblay is a phenomenal child actor. It's too often
when children in movies are two dimensional characters, whose range as
characters moves from 'cute' to 'annoying brats'. Tremblay was more
than that - he showed feelings and variety. He was accurately
childishly annoying in some scenes but I never held it against his
characters because it made sense that he would behave in such a way.The director also handled space in an excellent way. In the beginning
Room doesn't appear all that small which showed nicely how to Jake it
was his only known world. In the end we are shocked to see how small
Room truly is and that combined with the camera showing Brie Larson's
face makes her character all the more tragic.

Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamsom and stars Brie Larson and Jacob
Tremblay. I will not describe the plot because if you no nothing going
into this movie, I feel like it makes so much special. What makes this
movie so special and worthy of being nominated at the Oscars is the
performances by Larson and Tremblay. I've never seen such great acting
by a nine year old year kid before. Brie Larson also did a fantastic
job, an amazing performance that in my opinion she will win the best
actress. This movie is also directed beautifully which is all thanks to
Lenny Abrahamson. The only negative that wasn't very a negative for me
but might be for some people is that it is a very slow and heavy movie
but the great storytelling just makes you want to see what happens
next. Overall Room is a fantastic story of a mother and her child in a
bad situation. The performances were amazing by everyone. Definitely
deserves to be in the Oscars race.

Wow. I was just amazed. I had read the book before seeing the movie and
this is one of the very very few cases where the movie is as good as
the book. I left the theater joyous and so delighted. It made made me
laugh, and cry (which has only happened in a handful of movies). It
totally deserves to win Best Motion Picture of the Year. Brie Larson &
Jacob Tremblay were phenomenal actors in this movie. I love this movie
so much. This is definitely worth the watch. This is a beautiful
adaptation and a wonderful, delightful, and heartfelt movie that
everyone should see. Brie Larson was so great and she connected with
Jacob so well. I can't stress enough how much I love this movie. It
left me thinking about how love can conquer any obstacle life throws at
you. Trust me when I tell you, you'll love this movie.

An innocent tale of the world seen from a 5 year old kid's view.Jack
and his Ma were trapped in a garden shed for 5 years.Jack had always
believed the room was his world.The struggle his mother undergoes to
give him a normal life inside a garden shed with just things to talk to
is endearing and heart wrenching.And when they finally come out of
captivity life poses new challenges..The child protagonist Jack is
beautifully enacted by Jacob Tremblay.Definitely a talent to look
forward to.Its a shame that he is not being nominated in the Best Actor
category for Oscars.Brie Larson's strong portrayal of 'Ma' is character
which is going to remain in memory for a while.The dilemma the
character undergoes when the press interviewer asks her if she did the
right thing by keeping Jack with her is so painfully depicted.The
director does a brilliant job of using Jack's innocence to take the
narrative forward.For instance,when Jack innocently asks Ma if they
were in a different planet after he is saved from his captor is funny
yet painful when you realize what the kid has to go through to get
accustomed to the actual "world'.the cinematography is ingeniously done
from the perspective of Jack,the focus shifting form close up shots
when Jack was in the shed to longer and colorful shots once the duo is
out in the real world. Room does leave you with a few dried up tears
because you cry when you see the horror of captivity but you soon are
smiling at the innocence and hope that Jack brings to his mother's
world by bidding the final goodbye to the Room and makes peace with his
past.

Amazing. A tense, intriguing, sad and compelling story, addressed in an
excellent way, in a way that can maximize all these aspects are of
vital importance in the construction of the entire film, this is a
brief summary of all quality Room. But it is not only that, the
performance - just like in any great movie - is another plus point,
(and very positive!) Both Brie Larson protagonists (which competes for
the best actress Oscar in 2016) and Jacob Tremblay (which could easily
compete for the prize as well), has a great chemistry, which is vital
for a film with much of their time focused on only a quarter, and, of
course, both individual performances are magnificent, Brie goes all the
anguish and anxiety that your character must have already Tremblay
easily changes ingenuity of times to other distress and even happiness,
with a fluidity simply fantastic, and the most frightening: He's only 9
years! A great movie, which is very well the difference in quality
Oscar to competing films compared to last year, really worth watching.

It's one of those movies you'll like or dislike a lot ;) I understand
how some people find it boring or shallow, with such an emotionally
charged topic - one easily slips into the expectation of some deep
psychological character's plot/revile or action scenes... It is not that kind of the movie. Also, that's why I like it so much ;)
The director choose to give us only vague guidelines about the core
events, through little everyday interactions of the two main
characters: a mother and her son. For those hungry for more, sometimes
you'll get bits and pieces of kid's internal monologues,
interpretations of things happening... But as far as the mother's
character concerning - it's reduced to a minimalist, somewhat 'live
stream' point of view, not even a documentary one, cause that one would
insert at least some of her reasoning, points of view. We get none,
just her actions and those are all about dealing with her son's
reactions. It's a tricky little world, just a tiny little Room; yet
left wide open, for us to imagine her emotions and thoughts about it
all... I love it. You may not. You may wanna the whole story served here and
now, with all the clever plots and intellectual conversations and drawn
emotions. Or maybe you'll just love it for what it is.

Room is a dive into the head of a child's perspective, who witnesses
the world for the first time. Emma Donoghue comes with a tale that is
so beautifully wrapped under the outlook of Jack who believes space is
confined. It is in a way reflective of how we have been living in
today's world, and how possibilities gawk at us from a distance, and we
are never prepared to challenge ourselves into stepping out.Ma: You're gonna love it.Jack: What?Ma: The world.The plot of Room unfurls like a beautiful flower. You are thrown into
the mundane sphere of daily chores, and then suddenly you are told
what's happening and what seems to be the disconnect. It is hurled at
you at once, amidst the regularity and it is hard to handle just like
Jack's head refuses to accept it. But then again that is the truth.
Jack, the smart kid he is, accepts it and tries to help his Ma out,
whilst challenging himself to a bizarre world that he has never
encountered before.What are quite thoughtful are Jack's diegetic thoughts which go in the
background often telling you how he feels about the world. They put
your insight in the garbage. Seeing the beauty of the world through a
learning phase is indeed really soothing. That's where the screenplay
goes really brilliant. His words are so powerful and yet so innocent
that he will compel you to go broody.Jacob Tremblay is exceptional as Jack who turns five and knows
everything. Brie Larson plays an outstanding Ma, and fiddles with the
right emotions. So is Joan Allen as Nancy, Jack's grandma who epitomes
sanity and tries to put sense and normalcy in the inane.SPOILERS: Film's most touching moment is when Jack reunites with his
mother and the music bashes your nerves to dust. It makes you happy and
sad at the same time. But that's only the half of it. The rest of the
movie progresses with how he tries to gel up with the asynchronous.
Lenny attempts to manifest how Jack sees his surrounding through his
sheepish eyes once he is out in the open. You can almost feel yourself
feeling sorry for Jack and Ma. It would make you want to hug him right
up and teach him the ways of the world.Room concludes at an arresting juncture where Jack wishes to see the
room he used to live in. He finds it smaller now that he has seen more
of the world, and bids every object he used to adore so much in that
room farewell, as his ultimate closure. It is really so pensive that
you can't shake it off. It was like he was in a womb till he aged five.If you are a drama freak, you can't simply miss this one. Brilliantly
thought of and well written. Thank you Emma!

It says a lot about the quiet yet assured power of Room that despite
the fact half of Lenny Abrahamson's film takes place in the titular and
small "room" or really prison that Brie Larsons Ma and her son Jack
played by impressive newcomer Jacob Tremblay are kept in, scenes in the
film constantly engage the viewer through terrific performances, a
taught and sharp script by Emma Donaghue (who here adapts her own book)
and there's an emotional resonance that will catch many viewers off
guard.Room is not by any means of the word an easy sell or even a typical
cinematic piece of entertainment but Abrahamson who showed promise with
the sporadically brilliant Michael Fassbender starrer Frank has a clear
affiliation for the tricky material that Donaghue created.Focusing on telling the dark and in more ways than one horrific story
through the eyes of Tremblay's innocent and impressionable Jack, who
never once has set foot outside the thin yet impenetrable walls of his
world that he and his mum inhabit, Abrahamson finds himself directing
many of Room's proceedings as though they were being seen through the
eyes of a 5 year old child just as Jack is. Utilising a sparring yet
effective voice over from the young boy that tells us all we need to
know about how he sees the life he lives and constructing impressive
visuals even in the films tight surrounds, this is Abrahamson's real
calling card after two commendable early efforts and the cast also join
Abrahamson in an reaching another level of success.She may have just recently won a surprise Golden Globe for her
committed and believe able turn as a loving mother but Brie Larson has
been carving out a noteworthy collection of films over the last few
years so the true breakout of Room is young Tremblay.Tremblay delivers a deep and beyond his young years turn as Jack and
it's thanks to this child actors success that Room becomes the film
that's been resonating with audiences the world over. While Larson will
be billed as the star here it is Tremblay that carries the film through
its sometimes murky middle half and whenever he and Larson share the
screen, Room is an often faultless exercise in dramatic filmmaking.
It's a stunning turn and one that will likely seeing the young
performer be an in demand presence in the years to come.While it arguably loses some head of steam after a breathtaking opening
half in its exploration of the opportunities that lay outside the
prison walls, Room is a unique and emotionally strong tale of the bond
mothers and sons share and in a strange yet touching manner, a tale of
what it means to be alive in this great big beautiful world we call
home.4 remote control cars out of 5

Imagine if your entire world was a single room. Adorning this room is a
heater, a small table, a bed, a closet and a toilet sans a seat. Also
in the room is a carpet, a sink, a tub and a small toaster oven. The
only thing connecting you to the outside world is a skylight, an old TV
and a crestfallen mother with memories of the world behind your four
walls. Everything you know is in that room. How would you develop? How
would you understand; and what would happen if you left your world in
search of a better one?This is the story brought to luminous life in the film Room adapted
from Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name. Told largely from the
perspective of five-year-old Jack (Tremblay), the young boy comes to
grip with the realities of the outside world after narrowly escaping
imprisonment and saving his mother (Larson) from seven years of
isolation and sexual torture. Their tormentor is a man described simply
as Old Nick (Bridgers) a man always sporting heavy working boots,
thinly framed glasses and a look of indignation. Every night, Old Nick
trundles into the keycoded room and defiles his prisoner while Jack
tries to sleep in the closet. After turning five however, his mother
tells him of the outside world and plans an escape.Allegory of the Cave by Jan Saenredam The first act concerns the
realities of "room" and all it's little joys that Jack seems to savor.
While always having a demeanor of consternation, his mother gives him
the best version of gentleness she can afford, reading to him nightly
and constructing arts and crafts out of broken egg shells. Once we
leave room, the story floods the audience with a vortex of raw emotion
initiated by Jack's first real look at blue sky and tree branches. We
feel as Jack does; fright, confusion, elation, concern, in short a
complete sense of awe.The movie only gets more captivating as it goes on and I dare not spoil
anymore sufficed to say that the acting on the part of Brie Larson and
Jacob Tremblay is nothing short of revelatory. Fully immersed in
challenging roles, the two create a relationship so visceral and
rewarding that it can bring any unsuspecting adult to tears. Every
moment of joy and sadness is thoughtfully executed; which if put in
lesser hands would come off as manipulative. Larson recently won a
Golden Globe for her portrayal and will likely get at least an Oscar
nomination come January 14. My sincere hope is that Tremblay likewise
gets a nod complimenting the story arc of a mother strengthening her
son and visa versa.While not based on a true story per se, the novel Room was inspired by
a true case of abuse and imprisonment dubbed the Fritzl Case. The mere
fact that such things can happen in this reality stands as an
impeachment of humanity and all the disgusting things we do to each
other. Yet despite the tragedies that unfold before us and the toils we
might have faced, this small piece of fiction makes a case for hope and
perseverance in the face of hardship.

We all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind
with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale
set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the
present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096
Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being
made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the
poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations
rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion
picture.The both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other
like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The
first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single
room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins
to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few
minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction
to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important
storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the
room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it
affected the mother and son."If you don't mind, it doesn't matter."The movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even
considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery
remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was
seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line
'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with
his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs
their struggle for freedom.It was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just
they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know
when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult
life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the
situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four
again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world
looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but
that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put
her mother in that room."When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know
everything."It was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it
was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that
does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends,
it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I
thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in
narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself
like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that
won't be shown.When a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people
desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really
they are and that's what this film's second half. Remember, most of the
similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is
coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and
motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a
mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after
that.There were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad
feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master
plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume
differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the
mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar
to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his
other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow
development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the
Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely
one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.9/10

Room is based on, among other incidents, the crimes of Josef Fritzl,
but it's not a horror film: it's a drama about people who are
habituated to imprisonment. From the opening moments of Room, we are
guided by five year-old Jack(Jacob Tremblay), as he tells us what his
world is: Plant, Sink, Ma and TV. Everything else is Outer Space, where
Old Nick(Sean Bridgers), owner of Room, gets them Sunday treats.Ma(Brie Larson) is the only one who takes care of Jack, but she's no
saint: she gets upset, she gets frustrated, she lashes out, and so does
Jack. But none of the drama is overblown, instead staying firmly in
reality: Larson and Tremblay give naturalistic performances, while
Abrahamson's direction shows us Jack's perspective, without being showy
or distracting. Instead his camera simply hovers between the
characters, and we feel we are observing life from Jack's mind. For an
Irish-Canadian-British production, it seems to take more cues from the
humanism of a Dardennes Brothers film than a Hollywood drama. The story develops unexpectedly, even if you think you know where it's
going, seemingly unfolding without any plot contrivance. Emma
Donoghue's screenplay has a rare understanding for how children speak,
with cries of "liar, liar, pants on fire", but never talks down to her
audience. Casual references are made to Room, and Ma and Jack's past,
so that it feels like they exist beyond just what we're seeing. You will also cry. It's unavoidable. Jack lives in the young world of
exaggerated emotions, and we join him. There are big moments when he
discovers the world, emphasised by slow motion and an emotional score;
but there are quieter moments, such as when Jack meets a dog for the
first time. While only brief, they are handled honestly and provoke a
reaction from the audience without demanding. It's not a perfect film, as a couple of interactions feel forced and
the second act could be trimmed down. But these are just quibbles: Room
is a drama that manages to tell a moving story without resorting to
sappiness or melodrama. You could argue that by the time the credits
roll, many of the plot threads are left unresolved. But that would be
missing the point: Abrahamson is telling the story of Jack and his
Room, not Ma, or Old Nick or anyone else: and for him everything if
finished.

If you're itching to see a masterpiece in film, then go out and watch
Room. It's the perfect example of filmmaking that doesn't dumb itself
down for its audience. And at the same time, it isn't highbrow or
overly complicated. Room starts out in a padded room with a young boy, Jack (Jacob
Tremblay), and his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), lying in a bed together.
We're not sure why they're there at first. But eventually we figure
things out. Joy was abducted 7 years prior and Jack is her son by her
captor. Joy is a normal mother. She loves her son. She get's annoyed by him
from time to time, just as a normal mother would. Everything is not
hunky-dory, but the two of them are content there with each other. Or
at least Jack is. You can sense, in Joy's eyes, that she is hiding
pain. Jack doesn't know of anything that's happened. He knows of no
world beyond those walls.It's not until about 25 minutes in where we realize what's going on.
But we don't mind because the journey there is just as riveting. The
plot is revealed very slowly, as the filmmakers let us figure things
out on our own, and do well not to spell things out for us. They don't
assume the audience is stupid--at least those who are willing to commit
to the storytelling. Nothing is ever stated, but we have a grasp on
background and character dynamics due to brilliant exposition. Room is slow, I admit, but consistent. Director, Lenny Abrahamson knows
what he's doing at all times. Besides getting fantastic performances
from his leads, I'm thrilled with every choice he makes. From what he
includes to what he omits, he understands what's necessary for us to
get as organic of an experience possible. This movie could very well be
depressing, but it intentionally never stays in one place long enough
to do so.Larson is something to behold in this film. She's pretty much gives as
flawless of a performance that anyone possibly can. It's perhaps the
best female performance I've ever seen. And Tremblay, for a child, is
extremely believable the whole way through. The film is ultimately about moving on. And that process can be long
and drawn out and never- ending. There are times while watching this
film when we ask ourselves how it will end. Not because we want it to,
but because we're not even sure how any ending would be enough. But
then we find out we're not looking for an ending at all, but a
beginning.Twizard Rating: 100

When I tell people Room is great, they generally say one of four
things: 1) "never heard of it"; 2) "I read the book and it was good";
3) "you mean The Room, the worst movie ever made?"; or 4) "that sounds
like a terrible movie."Teenager me probably would've hated Room, but more sophisticated, adult
me found Room to be a wonderful, tasteful exploration of existence,
time, space, and what it means to be living in a world of good and
evil. Room made me feel a way about a movie I haven't felt since I
watched The Elephant Man years ago.It would be easy to turn Room into a ham-fisted Lifetime movie, but the
acting, pacing, and restraint of Room could go a long way to show
Quentin Tarantino that you don't need a lot of yelling, dialogue, and
forced situations to make a movie. Brie Larson (Ma) is certainly Oscar-
worthy for a delicate and tortured performance that never gets derailed
by any maudlin notes, and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) does some of the best
child acting I've seen, even handling off-screen narration with
impressive realism.We get two distinct hours. For the first hour we are trapped in Room,
finding small pleasures in small things, alternating with the terror of
an evil man. The second hour does something amazing: it gives you a
heartfelt examination of Jack and Ma entering the world, emotionally,
physically, and somewhat spiritually. Never has the simple act of
walking a scruffy dog or playing with a ball in a yard meant more on
screen.It's a shame so many people have never heard of Room, who all went to
see the mindless action movies of this summer, who probably will never
see Room.

Room is a touchy story about Jack and his mother that was kept isolated
in a "Room" by a man who kidnapped her, raped her and got her pregnant
and is using her as sexual slave for more than seven years. While Jack
now five years old, spent the whole life in that "Room", not knowing
that there is a life outside the "Room".I started to watch every movie nominated for Best Picture, and Room is
the second one after Spotlight. I had a feeling that there wasn't good
movies this year, but I'm happy to say that I was wrong.Room is another pure drama that will be stuck in my head for a long
time. A masterpiece story by novelist Emma Donoghue directed by Lenny
Abrahamson in perfection. Very touching, with great characters and
great acting job.Jacob Tremblay is so young, I don't know if this kind of story would be
a good idea for someone of his age, I mean psychologically. However, he
was great and one of the things that I enjoyed most about the film. It
felt like reality show. I feel sorry that he wasn't nominated for
Oscar.One of the part that I liked the most was when Jack narrates his
feeling inside and outside the "Room". I always enjoy the narration in
movies.Story, dialogs, acting, directing and narration is great. A worth
watching movie without a doubt. Different story, very well made.

A mother and her son, which looks like a girl, live in a room that has
no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that coming through
an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a bright five-year old boy
with hair down to his shoulders wakes up every morning saying hello to
his universe. He does not greet the sun, the grass, the trees outside,
where he could run and laugh and play like a normal five-year old but
only to the objects he knows for five years as being "the real world",
his world: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only
friend is a mouse that he feeds, thinking that the mouse also lives in
that little world, the only one real for him. Sometimes a man comes
over, during the night, and then Jack must sleep in the wardrobe, not
to be seen. The relationship mother-son appears to be normal: they
cook, dance, laugh, stretch out, read about Alice, mother tells the
tale of Monte Cristo. The poverty that surrounds them is not painful.
The real pain and anger I felt when Jack could not believe that outside
"the room" exists a real world, with real people, and trees, grass,
leaves, seasons, snow. Then the reality strikes: captivity. A child
born in captivity, because of a madman, a rapist. A story of a child
whose life started in a cage having as a talisman his mother love and
her tooth, thinking that "his strong" is in his long hair. Real world
proves to be scarier than "the room". A movie that should be seen, a
story that must be known, a boy that deserves all the awards: Jacob
Tremblay.

An amazing adaptation of a book I loved. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay
give amazingly true central performances as a deeply devoted mother and
son, with superb support from Joan Allen, who is also wonderful in her
role as a loving, deeply hurt mother and grandma and William H Macy is
also striking in his brief appearance as a far too damaged dad. All credit to the crew, particularly the director, Lenny Abrahamson and
Jacob's family and support team, for getting such an amazing
performance out of such a young boy. We couldn't think of one to match
it.I'd read the book, so knew the story and had particularly loved the
fantastic idea of using a 5-year old narrator (which the film honours).
My husband hadn't. Half-way through the film he was so upset that he
had to beg me to reassure him that it was going to be all right. The
man beside him, also with his wife, was so moved that at one point he
absent-mindedly reached for my husband's hand. It's THAT moving.If you've ever been, or had, a loving mum, go and see it. If you've
ever been a child, go and see it. Just GO AND SEE IT, please.

Watching "Room" is an intense experience for it's the story of a woman
(ma) who fights for the survival of her child, the one source of
happiness and strength in a very limited world, a place that could have
killed her long ago. At first, we see the interaction between mother and Jack. Through the
eyes of a very gifted director, we are able to almost feel their hearts
beating, how their souls are almost like one. He depends on her
completely because it's all he has known. She has insulated him from
pain and created a world inside their prison. He's happy, and that
sustains her. It's what makes her endure the visits of her kidnapper.
She has become one with the child, but one day she realizes he will
grow up, and this place will not be sufficient for either, especially
for him. Jack is a bright and inquisitive young boy. He has learned to
read, and he is beginning to wonder. She knows it won't take long for
his soul to break because he's like her, a part of her: a sensitive
soul that needs to grow and develop. There's much love here, but
there's plenty of sadness and horror, too.One day, she fashions a plan to secure his freedom, and at first, it's
not good enough, but with a modification, it succeeds, and this is
barely the first half of the film because unlike other stories and film
makers who take the easy road and simplify the dilemma or the problems
of the main characters, this film has taken us to the edge of the
precipice, and if you thought the life in the room was hell, things are
about to really intensify.Transitioning into normalcy is not as simple as it's in the fairy
tales, and just like Larson and Tremblay have already proved themselves
as accomplished actors, their performances become even more exquisite
in the second half of the story. We got to know them as they spoke
about the world. We knew how simple their existence was, how
controlled, and how dangerous it was, too. We became part of their
world, and now as the doors of freedom are open, we begin a long road
to adjustment. It is not easy. It might have more pain than we
realized.Most people are happy to see Ma (Joy), but Jack represents many things
to others. For those with a big heart, he's a bright and scared little
boy who will most likely be o.k. after a while. It's the immediate
family who have the toughest time since the transition is sudden and
very emotional. Joy's mother tries the hardest, and it's a good thing
she's around. Others experience a myriad of feelings which will affect
both Jack and his mother. Her prison has changed her, and her
expectations don't quite match her perceptions. It's at this moment that I was so impressed by Tremball's performance,
which is better than most of this year's praised performances, adult or
otherwise. He communicates his emotions through body gestures, glances,
strong lonely yearning with his eyes, as he goes through the new trauma
the big world has for him.It's a long and painful road, but it has a good resolution, one that
feels real and universal, one that doesn't rely in long speeches,
beautiful photography or any sort of overblown productions. This is as
heartfelt as they come, giving us another reason to believe that we
haven't forgotten to be human.

this movie have taken my breath away for almost two hour and its so
great when it comes to cinematography and story line and motion
picture, i will be surprised if they did not nominate it for Oscar this
year.Brie Larson preformed well and acted well and she deserve the Oscar for
this i did not like how the story went slow after they been rescued but
due to the purpose of the story line they had to maintain such level.they did not also gave us enough information about what happened to the
kidnapper.just watch it and stop wondering around, 8/10

this is a great film. i only came to comment because of something that
happened in the film that annoyed me so much. spoilers ahead.so when she gets home and they are interviewing her for what seems to
be a daily TV show its so annoying but it would be just the kind of
reaction you would expect from a snobby women working on TV who has had
daddy do everything for her and thinks she can sit down and pass
judgement on a girl who has been hold hostage for a good 5 years if not
more. i am guessing it was 5 years. hold in a room in a shed. and yet
this reporter still takes a stance that she is above her, that what she
thinks and says is so important and is so. while interviewing her it is
so typical of the interviewer coming from a place of judgement and not
from a place of love or care. it is a part of this sick world we live
in where ego of the wealthy seems to think it is so much better than
anyone who has had any kind of hardship, so annoying.and it is done so
well. and it annoyed me so much am guessing that was the intention. so
daddys girl interviews the girl about her baby boy. who she conceived
from the man who held her captive for 5 years. first she asks how she
feels about the father of her child. obviously an horrendous question
knowing what she has been through but am sure i could imagine this
being asked. and then. she asks her why didn't you get your captive to
drop off your child at a hospital somewhere. a man. who held her
hostage and raped her why didn't she ask this sexual monster to do the
right thing. and take away her child. really. to a hospital and drop
him off because it would have been better for the child. really. how
could she ever know that. he could have killed the child. anything
could have happened. how can you expect a man a beast who has hold you
hostage for 5 years. to take your child away and do the right thing.
this annoyed me SO much. and it is only because of her actions she is
now alive and well and also her son is alive and well. it is her
actions that made it possible for him to escape and for her to be
saved. yet this so to do women thinks she can judge. so screwed up our
world is people. daddys girl would have never experienced what it is
like to be hold hostage your life at risk. yet she sits there and
judges her. its horrendous. later i believe it is what causes her to
commit suicide feeling she was worthless. its a very touching film. but
also shocking. its very well done. really got me going.

I was very hesitant to watch this film. I knew the subject matter and
find news about abduction and abuse very upsetting. The thing is, I
wanted to see the performances by Larson and Tremblay, so I watched it.
They did not disappoint. They were both absolutely flawless. I was
shocked at how the film wasn't that difficult to watch. I thought I'd
be tense the whole time but I wasn't. It really is a movie that the
masses can relate to. Anyone can find a way to relate to this. It is a
film about a mother and son bond. I also love that the author of the
book also wrote the screenplay (love seeing a female screenwriter!)
It's nice that she got to choose what parts of her story were shown on
screen. I probably won't be able to watch this film again (lots of
crying was happening on my part) but I highly recommend seeing it if
you haven't.

Great movie. Difficult to watch because it really hits a nerve and puts
you in the shoes of the characters and the difficulty they endure from
the kidnapping.I've seen many episodes of forensic investigation shows and this one
really does a good job in portraying a fictional story based on
probably real-life inspired events.The first half hour is a little boring as not a whole lot changes,
however, it is a great introduction and really gets you hating the
"room" featured in the movie.Great acting both by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.This and "99 Homes" with Andrew Garfield really bring to life some of
the social issues facing America today.

Having read Emma Donoghue's novel ROOM, I was looking forward to the
film adaptation. I suspect she could have sold the film rights to a big
name director like Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg. We would have
been treated to a talking egg snake or an animated plant. Sometimes too
much money doesn't make a better film. ROOM is proof of that. ROOM is
proof that less is way more, that subtlety and nuance is far more
valuable than every special effect that money can buy. Ms. Donoghue was
protective of her work and it paid off. She went with a director who
understood the novel and who was willing to collaborate with the
author. Director Lenny Abrahamson has brought ROOM beautifully to life
on the screen. The director is true to the feel of the novel. Donoghue
has done a terrific job on the screenplay. And the two lead actors
totally inhabit Ma and Jack. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve
every great review, every award they can get. Tremblay isn't just a
talented child actor. He's a talented actor. He's extraordinary,
present in every moment he's on screen which is pretty much every scene
of the movie. Larson shows us so many layers of Ma, a young woman who
is trapped and needs her young son to help her win their freedom. We
feel her love for her son, her fear for his future, her frustrations
and her battles with the after shocks of life in Room. ROOM is a
beautiful film about the life saving love a mother has for her child
and his love for her. The only thing I wish was that ROOM had gotten
wider distribution. It's a film that is a must see.

We all have our 'room' and most of us witness that turn in our lives,
where we come out of the 'room' created by our society and start
questioning the truths, whether it is Political or religious beliefs.
This is a perfect flick to explain the lives from a third eye in an
over simplified manner and it will leave you awestruck and enlightened.It was a beautifully made movie with great cinematography with
outstanding performances by little Jacob and Brie, Though the plot was
not that logical and had many holes in the storyline if you see from
reality perspective but still a must watch for every generation with
deeper lessons about life.

The first hour of this film is as taut and compelling as any
psychological thriller, you're really in it with the mother and son and
rooting for them to get out. The writing, direction, and production
design are top notch.Once the mother and soon do escape, the filmmakers don't seem to know
what to do with them, and the quality of everything to do with the
second half is a mediocre-at-best, straight to cable melodrama. That
quality includes the acting, directing, writing, set design (aside from
he subtle "bars" in the home set.This material seems better suited for a TV drama or serial.Granted, the lead performances are spectacular.

I would like to start off this review by stating that I have been an
IMDb user for nearly five years and have rated hundreds of movies and
TV shows, but this is only my first review. I try not to give 10 out of
10 ratings lightly, but Room more than deserved it. I felt so strongly
about this film that I was compelled to try writing a review. I did not
know much about Room going into the film. All I knew was that a mom and
son were confined in a small room 24/7. I was absolutely blown away by
nearly every aspect of the film. I'm having trouble thinking of any
flaws in the movie. Brie Larson was simply incredible as "Ma". While I
have seen many of this years top movies, I have not seen them all.
Nevertheless I have a hard time believing that any actress had a better
performance. She will certainly be nominated and should win the Oscar
for lead actress. Prior to seeing Room I had only seen Larson in
supporting roles in movies and TV. I had no idea she was capable of
such a performance and I look forward to seeing her in future roles.
Not to be outdone was Jacob Tremblay, who played Larson's son "Jack".
Tremblay had what I believe to be the best performance by a child
actor/actress in cinema history. I know it's hard to make such a claim,
but I was that taken aback by Tremblay's performance. I don't care
whether or not Tremblay is nominated as a lead or supporting actor
(even though he was a lead in my opinion I know the academy often puts
child actors as supporting nominations regardless of their role) as
long as he is recognized for his incredible work. I truly felt
emotionally invested in these two characters. I genuinely cared for
these characters and felt helpless alongside them trapped in "Room". In
the scene where Jack is in the back of Old Nick's pickup truck I nearly
yelled at the screen. I usually don't show such strong and outward
emotions in real life let alone when watching a movie. Emma Donoghue's
story is incredible as is Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I feel the need
to single out the amazing job done by cinematographer Danny Cohen,
especially in the scenes when Jack first sees the world outside of
"Room". I felt like I was truly seeing the world through Jack's eyes.
Everything looked so vast and bright even though all I was seeing was a
simple neighborhood. I may need to give myself more time to digest this
film (and perhaps and other viewing), but I think I have to already say
this is one of the best films I have ever seen. It could even be in my
top 10 films ever, although, like I said, I may just being saying this
because the film is so fresh in my memory. While Star Wars: The Force
Awakens is still my favorite movie of 2015, Room edges out both Star
Wars and Spotlight for my choice of best film of 2015. I will be
rooting for Room throughout awards season and hope to see it win the
Oscar for Best Picture.

Right from the first scene, Lenny Abrahamson shows us so much with a
simple piece of information. Ma loses a tooth, making us realise she's
not seen a dentist in years; Jack falls in love with a mouse because
it's real, remaining us that he's likely never seen a living, breathing
creature. We ache for Jack's lost innocence but also the same for his
spiritually broken mother. When the two of them scream at each other,
we feel the tragedy for both of them. Eventually, of course, Jack and
Ma make it out of Room and Abrahamson does a terrific job at conveying
Jack's terror at a world he doesn't understand. Shots from Jacob's POV
are filtered, shaky and intrusive with extreme front-lighting, making
us flinch back from the screen. The choice of music creates a sense of
wonder but also a sense of sadness, and the inspired choice of casting
the doctor to look exactly like their captor makes Jack's fear
palpable. The whole film is cleverly from Tremblacy's point of view,
replicating that spectator experience Jonathan Demme created in Rachel
Getting Married. It is like you are there with Jack the whole time. The
escape scene has the emotional resonance that Frank Darabont brought to
The Shawshank Redemption, and even some of the small spats between
Tremblay and Larson are reminiscent of Rian Johnson's Looper.The film breathes on the achingly beautiful performances by Brie Larson
and Jacob Tremblay. Larson's spirit is completely broken and we learn
that early on from a rape scene where Old Nick is chatting nonchalantly
as if she's a normal relationship. We see naked emotion play clearly
across Larson's face as she is traumatised by a terrible interview
question, scared by the knowledge that there may be no way for them to
rescue her even if Jack did escape, embittered by her realisation that
her friends all lived normal lives, and enraged by her father's refusal
to acknowledge her son. Her performance is truly spectacular, but of no
less import is Jacob Tremblay. He carries the film on his tiny
shoulders and does such an incredible job in portraying Jack's
emotions. A scene in which he cries about his imaginary dog will make
you long to console him and then a later scene where he meets an actual
dog will bring an enormous smile to your face. William H. Macy feels
underused but is solidly excellent in his small role as Joy's father,
whilst Joan Allen is a firm hand on the final third of the film and
sets up a great Oscar-scene between herself and Larson.Emma Donoghue's screenplay is well-balanced between Jack's discovery
and the events actually taking place. The character of Old Nick, whilst
well-acted, is a great testament to Donoghue's writing more than
anything else. There is a demented sense of morality in his words that
show you he feels no remorse. That is what makes him a great villain.
Donoghue's superbly written scenes make the movie what it is,
everything else is a vital but supporting piece. This film would have
stank with a lesser screenplay.Room is a film of small scope but grand effect. In many ways it is the
Boyhood of this year. There's so much naked emotion floating around in
this beautiful film that it's impossible not to be touched.

"Room" starts in the middle of a horrifying tale of abduction with
little back story and little history. And that works wonder. It places
us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main
characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me
almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film,
"The Act of Killing." There are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and
melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music,
being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie. The framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the
feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are
terrifying. The acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the
five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the
complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We
aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.There were so many times this film could have gone for cheap
sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and
happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well
writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve
stunts or explosions. Rating: Pay Full Price"Room" is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the
issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail
regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were
dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic!
The music? Terrible. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations. Peace, Tex Shelters

"Room" is based on the 2010 novel of the same name, written by
Irish-Canadian author Emma Donoghue who was also responsible for the
film's screenplay. It tells the story of a 5-year old boy named Jack
(Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma (Brie Larson), who are living in the
confines of a small enclosure after Ma was kidnapped by a man when she
was 17, and has been held captive there for last 7 years. This same man
was responsible for Jack's birth, so Jack knows nothing or has seen
anything else in his life apart from this room he's currently holed up
in. After a daring escape plan finally frees Ma and himself, both
individuals must find a way live a customary lifestyle again, but
things are much harder than it seems."Room" works simply because of how unembellished and dreary it's
narrative is and how seamlessly Larson, Tremblay and Joan Allen fit
into this world of hopelessness. The acting from the two leads are
stunning; you will not see a more genuine and heartbreaking Mother &
Son relationship as this for a long time. Their rapport and on screen
chemistry was dazzling. Larson exudes that devoted motherly persona, doing her utmost to keep
her child protected at any cost and blames herself forcefully for the
situation they find themselves in. She doesn't care about her own
wellbeing; everything she does, all her actions and rational thinking
is about how she can get her child out of this nightmare and how to
bring his life back around to normality. If you loved her in Short Term
12, she takes it up another notch here with a monumental display of
sadness, anger & pure unadulterated love. Amazing, Oscar worthy stuff
and if she won it would very much deserved; a performance that packs an
almighty wallop.Tremblay couldn't have played this role any better and he can easily
join the ranks of the greatest child performances I've ever seen. It's
a difficult part to play, but like Larson he gives his character so
much depth and complexity and carries the same amount of care and
affection for his 'Ma' that she has for him. Being such a young age, he
doesn't quite understand what's going on, so he takes whatever his Ma
says as gospel. He only knows 'Room'. He only knows what he see's on
the TV in Room. He only knows the sky is blue. He doesn't know there's
a huge universe out there waiting for him, that there are more people
like him and Ma, that the dogs and cats and trees he see's on TV are
real. The growth we see Tremblay's character experience and the way he
conveys it is utterly transfixing; it's hard to believe he's just
9-years old. A big, big future ahead for this hugely talented kid.And credit must also go to Joan Allen, whom I've admired for a while
now but hasn't had a role like this in years. It's such a delicate and
thoughtful performance, perfectly nuanced but enough there to feel her
woes. It reminded me of Dern in last year's 'Wild', and I was so happy
when Dern got a nomination because I loved her in that. I feel the same
way about Allen. The direction is very much on point and the gorgeous score has been
criminally under-appreciated. It's not in your face but it doesn't need
to be, as composer Stephen Rennicks elects to keep a smooth, perfectly
apt melody whilst only increasing the strings slightly for the more
intense moments. "Room" is a film that will stay with you for days. It's subject matter
is dark, leaving very little leeway for humour or any sort of respite
from a grim situation. What we're presented to us is a highly grounded
tale of human nature, the ugly side of it, but also the true beauty and
strength of a Mother-Child bond.

The novel written by Emma Donoghue was fantastic and very captivating.
I was glad that the movie version showed more of the outside world for
both Ma and Jack. The movie was just outstanding and amazing that I
bawled at least thrice.There were scenes were I couldn't take the loneliness, the anguish, and
the desperation portrayed by Ma. It was truly heartbreaking seeing her
broken but she still tries to remain courageous and holds on to her
hope for her son.Brie Larson definitely needs to be recognized as a fantastic actress.
All the actors need enough credit, and the film itself is just too
precious. I'm still shaken.I would recommend this film to anyone who wishes to see something
heartbreakingly precious. This is such an amazing film.

First off I'll say it's best if you go into this movie fresh with as
little known as possible, that way you will have at least that going
in.So you're trapped in a shed by a man who kidnaps you and rapes you
practically every day for seven years. In this shed there is a door
which is locked by a combination keypad lock, you have been provided
with sheets, some clothes, water, food, I think there is a glass or
two, matches, an oven/heater/microwave, and there is a skylight in the
top of the shed. The guy comes in to have sex with you and he eats the
food you cook for him and he sleeps in bed with you(not sex, actual
sleep). After a while you bear a child Now I'm pretty sure quite a bit
of you reading this would have come up with quite a bit of plans within
five minutes or at least a number of complicated plans within a span of
a week, or at the very least hatched a convincing plan when your son
was born and of a decent age to run. The woman in the movie however
comes up with two really bad plans, one of which surprisingly works.
Well actually her first plan consisted of hitting him that one time
with a really heavy thing, him damaging her wrist..somehow and she not
trying anything after that from what I can recall. I am still surprised
that the end plan actually worked considering how asinine it was,
didn't seem very logical and didn't line up with how a captor of this
woman would behave.Ignoring all that though, I thought it was a movie about the psychology
of victim and kidnapper/captor/rapist, or the mom and her son within
the confines of this shed and how they cope with being held against
their will and the child somehow not knowing this. Nope. I said okay
then fine, maybe it's about the plan and coming up and following
through with a plan that sets them both free and- nope. Then when the
escape takes place I thought it was then going to be about the kid
escaping from the guy and finding help. Nope, he finds it within a
minute of jumping out the truck. Okay then I thought, well the guy who
'saved' the kid didn't bother to take a photo of the truck or even
bother to note the license plate so I thought it would be a manhunt for
the guy and a race to get to the mom before the kidnapper-No, no, nope,
they find her within like five minutes. She's okay. Then maybe how
about she and her son living with the constant threat and presence of
the one who kidnapped her still on the lamb, free to swoop in and- no,
they arrest him in some aside news report. Well fine then, no action, a
quality drama about how this woman adjusts to losing all that time in
her life, dealing with how the world is now, getting a job, settling
back in, adjusting to men having being raped for seven years(or just
adjusting in general after being raped and confined for seven years and
having a baby for your rapist), picking up her life and how her son
adjusts to all this and being-No. Nothing of the sort really, or kind
of. They sort of go for some of those things, then stop short and drop
them. She gets depression but it's nothing that significant or rather
not shown to be that impactful, just seemed like the sort of depression
that I've seen in a number of teenagers. I figured we'd have much more
in the form of the son, but no, he's shy and has bad grammar, but it's
not really that out of the ordinary for a kid with say aspergers. Late
in the movie a random kid(I was actually thinking none existed in this
movie world since no one really came over to interact with the kid or
mom when they got back but is somewhat understandable) and he got along
fine with the other kid kicking a ball. Maybe about the family
dynamics, her parents aren't together anymore, maybe then about the
family why and how they split apart, how they must adjust to finding
their daughter and their son and-no, not really.It just sorts of superficially goes for things and then stops short, it
felt like watching a well made Lifetime movie of white middle America
drama. I guess it was partially my fault for seeing the numerous ripe
dramatic and tense places the film could have gone and then never going
there.You don't have to give me action, suspense, terror etc, but you could
have given me some solid drama to sink my teeth into, and unfortunately
this movie didn't have any of that for me. My wife liked it though, so
I guess it's more for the women Lifetime audience mom crowd.

We all know how the Academy continually gives out awards and award
nominations to the wrong movies, while snubbing movies that are
superior in every other way. HOWEVER, the Academy really dropped the
ball here.I am a huge movie buff and will pretty much watch anything even if the
premise doesn't have mass appeal. This one clearly has less mass
appeal, but the critical acclaim drew me in and wasted 1 hour and 20
minutes of my life (I couldn't watch the last 40 minutes and after
reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I was relieved/upset to find out
I didn't miss anything.)The character development flat out sucks. I'm all for movies with a
slightly ambiguous nature, but you gotta satisfy the viewers somehow by
letting them know what's going on and having the movie make sense. Brie
Larson is decent in the main role, but her character isn't really
explored and there isn't enough depth to her character. Jack (don't
know the actor's name) is a basic 5-year old and I've heard a better
child-centric voice narration from a Disney movie. The only reason I gave it a 5 and not something lower is because there
are a few aspects of the film I liked. *SPOILER ALERT* The scene where
they finally escape from the room is engaging, but after that the film
drags on as the people who made this film don't have any knack for
quality storytelling. *END SPOILER ALERT*Don't waste your time on this movie as it doesn't do justice to a very
disturbing subject matter and only leaves you asking one question: Why
did I waste 2 hours of my life? Congrats Academy for messing up again.
It just really sickens me that great films like Love & Mercy, Straight
Outta Compton, Sicario, and The End of the Tour get not nearly the
acclaim they deserve by the Academy (Sicario and Straight Outta Compton
deserve more nominations) or fail to be recognized by the Academy at
all (Love & Mercy, The End of the Tour). The Academy sucks and this
film re-confirmed it for me.

Room is one of those movies that people read rave reviews about and
then adopt it. Having just watched a UK preview screening I wanted to
let you know what kind of a movie it really is.For starters it is really...well...cold. The director has tried a
silent approach to take out the emotion and concentrate on the subject
matter but has gone too far and left it a bland and dim affair. I was
expecting a lot more from the confined direction but not once did I get
feeling of claustrophobia. Every character was also very one
dimensional and stereotypical.Too many issues all going at once but none of them were dealt with
properly. It's not a bad movie but I think the bland direction and lack
of narrative let it down...I would imagine the book would be far,far
superior. Still worth a trip to the cinema because I love movies on the
big screen...where they should be...and it will not show well on T,V or
DVD.One of those movies that try to make you think but come across as
somewhat pretentious and believes it's own hype..will not win a single
nomination...let alone an award.

At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are
living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson)
has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that "outer space" is all that
exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel
truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.It is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as
the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside
world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new
experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to
Room, encounters different obstacles  the world has moved on, and she
doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.I had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring
escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a
novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.)
Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside
Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to
convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have
is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but
everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely
real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and
(relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her
captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack
and herself.To say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things.
We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the
entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing.
We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon
the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to
have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see
that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small
Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to
it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered
lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I
began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in
Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything
happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the
first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still
waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot
out of watching a whole lot of nothing.Once they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts
from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents,
played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to
the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them)
grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have
separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her
mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's
a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress
factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.The acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative,
and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy
also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and
that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good  as is his
character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than
in the outside world (and with good reason).But the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script.
Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it
weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is
no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I
look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time
contemplating things and not enough time doing them  or at least
discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more
reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled "A
Series of Plodding Events." The second half goes a long way toward
saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh
setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie.

This is Claustrophobia at its best! I usually hate these sort of
movies, but this movie somehow made it work! You would naturally think
how could been in whole movie work so well without been boring? Well,
this movie made it work. The direction and acting in this movie as just
so powerful that it could not be boring for a second.Ma and 5 year old Jack have been placed in a room for years and years
by a man by the name of "Old Nick." Old Nick never lets them leave.
Jack has never left this room before. Ma somehow manages to make a
small little room the whole world to Jack. She manages to convince jack
how fun it is been in one little room, and she convinces us too! Then
one day Jack escapes to make a terrifying and thrilling journey to self
discovery.Brie Larson was amazing as the Mother who has been abused and is
raising a kid to be strong and show him the real world. She deserved
the Oscar. I remember seeing Brie Larson is "21 Jump Street" and
thinking she will never make it in a movie like this. I was proved
wrong once again! My hates off to Jacob Tremblay who played 5 year old
Jack. He's one of the best Child Actors I have seen. He made every
scene seem so believable. Director Lenny Abrahamson brought this movie
to life with his amazing skills.Great movie. I would have loved to hear about "Old Nick" and seen more
of Ma's parents on screen, but that's only mild. Not even close to
destroy this whole film's powerful message. I give this 4/5 stars.

The story behind the movie is breathtaking on its own. Being held up in
a room for that long and not going insane is by itself a miracle and a
triumph of mind over matter. I loved the fact that the movie focused on
what happens after, which is a big deal on its own. Everyone seems to think that it's all about getting out of a hardship
when it's also about handling the aftermath and making it over such an
experience. This was not a sad movie. It was a movie about courage,
about never letting go and keeping it together. I will forever remember the dialogue when she says to the kid "I am not
a good mom" and he replies, "well, you're mom". This was the one phrase
that defined the movie. Nothing more needed there. This movie, while
not a 9 or a 10, it's one of these movies that will stay with you
forever.

For me good movies are the ones that leave me thinking about the
storyline and what happens even after the movie is over and that
happened with Room.The storyline is not complex at all and that's a good thing because I
could actually focus on the amazing performances by Brie Larson and
Jacob Tremblay, who's character seem annoying at times, but that makes
the performance even better.But then again, it's not only about the characters and how the actors
played them, the movie is so simple that you can actually understand
what's happening and get caught in the story and it's emotions.

Every once in a while a movie such as this one comes along, and if you
watch it you'll understand why I say "less is more"; I am talking about
simplicity, frame what you need in order to tell the story, and be
intimate, capturing the emotions giving by the performers, and all of
this is the combination of well written script  great actors  and a
just fine directing. But on top of everything we have Jack, and the
world seeing through his eyes when he finally has a chance to have that
encounter, furthermore, leaving us with the challenge, and that is,
bring back that innocent being we all once had, as it was suffocated by
the world we live in today. Jack shows how that can actually be done:
white is white  simple is simple  real and not real Let the sun
shine, even if it is through a small tiny skylight, for that we know
there is a God above everything.

Room is the story about 5 year old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his mother
Ma (Brie Larson) who are a typical loving mother and energetic son
filled with curiosity and imagination in an anything but typical
situation. They are both living, surviving, trapped in a 10 by 10 foot
space that Ma has called Room in her best efforts to protect Jack from
the absolutely unthinkable nightmare that is the only life he has ever
known, a life she isn't sure will ever be anything else. However,
miraculously, through Ma's ingenuity and guts and Jack's courage, one
day, they escape. With their 10 x 10 Room behind them, they face a new
world (literally) of hopes, possibilities, challenges and fears. I
wasn't sure if I wanted to watch Room or Spotlight next with the Oscars
upon us, but a good friend of mine, Steve Williams, strongly
recommended Room. I'll be watching Spotlight next, but thank you to
Steve for the recommendation. It was powerful. Larson has had
supporting roles in Trainwreck, The Gambler and Don Jon along with
multiple TV appearances, but this is her first leading role and she
also looks right at home. In fact, her performance has not only earned
her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but many critics are
predicting she will go home with the win and after watching the movie,
it would be an award well-deserved. Room opens on Jack's 5th birthday.
We find out later that Ma was abducted 7 years earlier and Jack was
born and raised in Room. Her abductor makes regular visits (conjugal in
nature) with Jack tucked away in Wardrobe. We already know from the
preview that they do eventually escape and are given a chance to have a
life outside Room, so that's not a spoiler there. I won't give it all
away, but the escape will leave you breathless with white knuckles as
you cling to whatever you have nearby. I really only had two minor
issues with the movie. First, after she is reunited with her parents,
Ma is unsettled to discover they had split and her mother (Joan Allen)
had met a new man. Her father (William H. Macy) flies home to be there
for the reunion, but quickly leaves and can't even look at Jack or
address him. And then we don't see him again and are left wondering
what happened. The second minor issue I had was that the preview uses part of its
limited time to share a scene after their escape between Jack and Ma in
which Jack is concerned about their abductor finding them again. Ma
reassures him that it will never happen. And it doesn't come up again
at all. It's handled just fine in the movie, but the issue is that the
preview seemed to indicate it would be a factor in the aftermath. It
wasn't. The aftermath of adjusting to the real world was dramatic
enough as it was and didn't need to be in the preview.Room is a touching, heart-warming, intense, gripping, original and
well-acted and well-told story that I thoroughly enjoyed. I predicted a
solid 4 stars: worth the money in the theatre, worth watching again,
and has a good chance of making it to my home collection, and that's
exactly what I'm sticking with.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com

A fantastic mix of genre, this film is a psychological thriller, a
horror film, a drama, a character study and all of this it is doing at
the same time seamlessly in what is one of the darkest films of the
year.This story is incredible and opens up naturally to an endless list of
themes that get explored and there is so much that can be done with
this core material that it would be practically impossible to include
it all, that's why Room succeeds. It understands what it is and doesn't
try to reach too far out of its zone in what would certainly result
overbearing. By putting the focus solely on the mother/son relationship
it doesn't feel like the film is missing anything.I have been telling everyone since I saw her in 21 Jump Street in 2012
that Brie Larson would be going a long way, this is proof of that and
whilst I still reckon Rooney Mara or Kate Winslet to be the best
actresses of the year, she sticks to a close third. There were times,
especially in the first half, where everything, every emotional beat
fell on her performance and she managed to rip your heart away. The way
in which she portrays a mother's worst fear is harrowing. Yet, her
fictional son, steals the show away from her. Look it is easy to get
too excited about a child performance just because it is good, but this
is not what's happening here. Jacob Tremblay has possibly upstaged my
favorite young performance ever (Tye Sheridan in "Mud") and I didn't
think that possible. He really made a character come to life, there
were no filters, it was a true performance that made him disappear from
the screen.I think that has also to be credited with Abrahamson fantastic work.
This is one of those few films where you really feel the director's
presence and it doesn't get in the way of the film. He really had a
strong vision for this and you see how powerfully it makes the
transition to the screen. You feel the confidence and the inspiration.I had a fantastic experience with the film, whilst it doesn't manage to
achieve what other sad films like, the example I always use, "Requiem
for A Dream", in other words to be depressing but at the same time give
you that rush of adrenaline and experience you kind of want to relive,
it is still a deep and insightful drama.

Screenwriter Emma Donoghue (adapting her own novel) designed an
intriguing structure which makes Room difficult to categorize. Is it a
thriller, a domestic drama or a character study filtered through an
unusual perspective? Don't worry; it's a rhetoric question, and I
prefer not to get into too many details, because the less the spectator
knows, the better the story will work. So, I will just say that Room is
a provocative and very interesting movie with an innovative premise,
amazing performances and solid direction. The story is generally
developed through the eyes of the kid Jack, something which offers an
incomplete vision of the facts; but thanks to the screenplay and Brie
Larson's extraordinary performance, we can quickly fill in the holes in
order to realize the scale of the situation and the way in which the
main characters assimilated it. But that's just the beginning. It can
be said that the "conventional" ending of the film happens during its
half, creating a brusque and significant thematic and narrative
transformation which brings new challenges to the screenplay and the
performances. Fortunately, both elements work, and they take us to an
ending which isn't necessarily happy, but definitely satisfactory. As I
previously said, Larson makes a magnificent work in her role (in my
humble opinion, she should have already won an Oscar for her
performance in Short Term 12), while the kid Jacob Tremblay also brings
an excellent performance, absolutely natural and convincing from the
beginning to the end. On the negative side of Room, it was a bit
difficult for me to adapt to the second half after the suspense of the
beginning; but that's when the previously mentioned character study
comes into scene, and once I comprehended that strategy, I recovered my
interest. Even though I liked Room pretty much, I don't have particular
wishes to watch it again; however, it deserves a recommendation because
of its originality and unusual execution. And, personally, it confirmed
me the damage the trailers make to the films they pretend to sell. If
you are interested in watching Room, don't watch any of its trailers.

7 years is a long time. It is a 5 year old whole and complete life. The
story behind this movie is so much more than possible displayed via a
screen. A life taken away from the world is gruesome. A life coming to the
world inside a maybe 10 square metres of a room is so far away what the
ordinary thoughts can grasp. I were so emotionally involved in the way
the mother had routines, structures and organization to build both her
and her sons life. Amazing! The whole concept of a human settle down in
its own mind and accepting a room for life is breathtaking. Accepting
the fate and raising a child for 5 years inside a shed. If I only think
about that, I feel so alive and proud of the freedom in the world...
the freedom in making own decisions. So...all right....enough with the
philosophy and the realistic point of view for this one.Oscar nominations has brought attention to the picture. And that is
fair. This movie has great acting, great production, great aspects of
the whole storytellling and a really good director.Maybe there could be even more realism considering the boy is out in
the world for the first time in his entire life.... and, on the other
hand... the mother had raised and educated her child in such a good way
that the courage took overhand in situations and helped them escape.The way back into the world can be long. The way back into the world
can be devastating. Sometimes is the sad thing the only thing to hold
on to...the habit of having something.I am so impressed by the way the story and the movie rolls out.
Splendid and important movie.8,3 out of 10

Room is one of those few movies which maintain the crisp of the
literary work they originated from mainly because the same person wrote
it for screen adaptation. If it were a young adult novel with fan
following, studios would have teared the novel into at-least 2 movies
so when one watches it, should remember that he is getting double the
fun and why not, Room is a powerful movie with all the elements a
blockbuster entertainer lacks these days.We open our eyes to the screen and we are in a small room with two
inhabitant. We spend a substantial amount of time in that tiny room but
never we ever feel suffocated because of the freshness maintained by
the director and drop dead performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob
Tremblay. One wonders if it is going to be a usual torture or survival
movie but it is bigger then that. It is very much common that movies
are taking a more realistic and social approach towards crises then
that of only physical ones.Room is based on a very strong idea and is made by a brilliant
director. Performances are of worth watching. Brie Larson is
magnificent, although much appreciation should be given to the casting
director who opted for her, as most of the praise Brie is getting, is
due to the persona she brought to the movie which is different then
regular cry baby. And that was the decision of who ever casted her as
they at that time gave the movie something other lacked. Jacob Tremblay
is brilliant in his role and it's very disappointing to see that many
of the award organizations have over looked his work. Although the script is very strong and to the point but the Jacob's
escape from the room seemed little weaker. Second half of the movie was
much inspired from Irwin Winkler's 'At First Sight' and Clind
Eastwood's 'American Sniper. Brie's performance is very good but not as
much as she is getting rewarded. As I explained, it's mainly her
personality which brought something new into this genre of movie. Rest
of the cast were good too. One last mention is for the art designer who
worked on the interior of the room which kept us interested in it all
the time we spent there.A work of art in the head of a blessed team.

Greetings from Lithuania.Here is what a professional film critic from New York Post has to say
about "Room" (2015): "Dopey as the film is on a plot level, it's
equally vapid in its psychology". Here is what i have to say to this
"professional film critic" - "Dude, please, change you profession,
ASAP, thank you"."Room" (2015) is THE best drama that came from 2015. It features great
performance by Brie Larson for which she deservingly must win Oscar,
great supporting work from veteran familiar faces, and probably THE
best acting from a child i have ever seen. This movie could have felt
apart very quickly if it weren't greatly played by actor portraying
Jack, in my opinion the key character in this story. Fortunately Jacob
Tremblay gives unforgettable, jaw-dropping performance that glues this
movie together. Superbly crafted by director Jacob Tremblay and
amazingly written by Emma Donoghue (based on her own novel), "Room"
tels the hard, gritty, and sometimes very difficult to imagine story,
that unfortunately has happened in a real world just months ago
(without children as i read). The first hour of this movie is simply a masterpiece. I won't spoil
anything, but the second hour goes in a different direction, but never
looses it's reality or great movie craftsmanship. I was waiting for
this movie months after i heard about it, and finally seeing it i'm so
glad it delivered everything i have hoped for - not that i wanted to
see such a story - i wanted it to see happening on the screen, in a
movie world. "Room" is as good as movie drama gets it.Overall, i can't praise this movie more - this is the best movie that i
saw in 2015. There are more movies from Best Picture contenders that i
haven't seen it yet, but those will be more visceral experiences.
"Room" is different kind of drama. It unfold just in front of, keeps
you glued to the screen for all it's running time 1 h 50 min. Sometimes
it will be difficult to watch, but don't turn away - this is the best
movie of 2015.

This just... this just... This movie just broke me. When I started
watching this, I taught it would be sad and everything, but not THIS
kind of sad. I mean, I cried in most part of the film. I cried watching
a boy eat cereal, that's how powerful this movie is. With a very hard
and deep topic, solid performances and the greatest photographer,
screen-writers, directors,etc ever, Room will be one of my
all-time-favorite-heart-breaking-movies. You want to cry? Just give
this movie like, ten minutes, ant then we talk. Another great thing
about Room is that, yeah, it's heart-breaking, it deals with a pretty
taboo topic and is very real; but at the same tame is fast-passing and
its so easy to connect with the characters... And I just love the
hopeful message at the end.This movie was simply too much for me.

although what Ma and Jack are suffering is not a thing that likely
happen to you or any one you know but this film makes you feel related
to them and it leaves you emotionally drained. the moment jack returns
to his ma you feel relived, and jack explanation to his surroundings
gets you to feel absurd.when Ma was having the interview and doubt got to her about what she
did for jack was the right thing it gets to you either. this was the

Okay. Wow, did I just fall in love with Brie Larson? Hell yeah! But was
it the soft gentle Brie I've grown accustomed to over the years, or the
Brie who was Jack's mom? Possibly the latter. This movie is a must- see
for so many reasons: good directing, great score, amazing acting. I
mean, Jacob Tremblay can act. There is no question he is the main
character of the film, the reason why this story is being told. And of course, where there is a yin there is a yang. The reason why
it's so easy to be sucked into Room right from the get-go is Brie
Larson aka Joy. While I was watching this, I guess I was waiting for
her to take over the action but she never quite did. Instead what
happened was that she and Jack shared this beautiful synergy, which
signified what this movie was all about: the bond between mother and
son. Some points in the second act (of the story) were dull, but the
relationship between these two made the first 45- 50 minutes of the
film grade A. In my opinion, Room is definitely worth the watch. The facts aren't all
that pleasant, but just hearing "The Mighty Rio Grande" during the
bridge between the first and second act, is enough to give you
goosebumps. Wasn't surprised by the acting, but more so by the
creativity, and that's always the toughest component to find in movies
today.

The film Room tells the story of 5-year-old Jack and his mother, Joy,
told in Jack's perspective. All of his life, Jack has lived in a small
world known as "Room," which his mother convinces is his reality, and
that everything beyond is fantasy. The room is small, fixed with only a
bathroom, a small kitchen, a television set, and a skylight. They
essentially live in an average bedroom.To the audiences, it becomes apparent that their living situation is
much darker than Jack perceives it. Through her sugar-coated stories,
Joy explains to Jack why they are in "Room;" Joy was abducted as a
teenager and kept in a security-locked garden shed by a man only known
as "Old Nick." When Jack becomes old enough, Joy uses him to finally
free the two of them from their prison. From there, Jack experiences
the outside world for the first time and begins adjusting to his new
life beyond "Room." What makes Room such a great film is that it places
the audience into the world of Jack. It lets the audience experience
how Jack comes to know "Room" as his whole world, and how he processes
seeing the real, outside world for the first time. The photography
employs hyper-focusing on objects in "Room" to accentuate Jack's
familiarity and never shows the outside world until Jack finally
escapes. From there, the direction of the film manages to make the
audience feel so acquainted with Room that everything else seems alien
for a moment.The film is multiple films at once, which is a good thing. The entire
premise of the film touches on Platonic themes explored in the famous
The Allegory of the Cave and incorporates those themes into a
contemporary issue, making it philosophical. At the same time, the film
deals with the emotional drama and friction that occurs not only with
Jack, but also with Joy. Joy struggles with trying to teach Jack about
the outside world, as well as trying to gain her family's acceptance of
Jack, since she is dealing with the fact that Jack is Old Nick's child,
while dealing with the media circus surrounding her story. The film
details the emotional experiences and side effects that occur when one
leaves the world and sees it for the first time again. It's
philosophical, psychological, and emotional.Fantastic performance from Brie Larson as Joy; she encapsulates the
deep emotional scars that her character carries from Room. She takes on
multiple roles as Joy; a strong mother figure for Jack, but also a
helpless, adjusting woman to her family. Jacob Tremblay gives an
excellent performance as Jack as well; he helps bring the film's
innocent perspective to life and provides a great emotional dynamic and
contrast to Joy.

Room is a very moving and depressing. It is extremely well acted and
put together. Brie Larson is my front runner for the Oscar, and little
Jacob Tremblay put together a great performance for being so young. I
didn't expect to see a phenomenally acted movie, but instead a
compelling story line. The first half of Room had both! Brie Larson is
a new star! Its hard to imagine that anyone else could have done as
well as she could. Tremblay was a great supporting role that
complimented Larson as well. His emotion and commitment to the role
really added to the terrible nature of that locked room.I was really expecting a great story, which there was. The entire movie
was a great story, but the first half did a much better job of telling
that story. After they escaped the room, the story went from compelling
and torturous, to just being depressing and rather slow. The first half
has something devastating happening that is also unique. No one can
imagine what these two were going through, and how just Larson and
Tremblay handled the isolation was amazing to watch. Honestly, if the
movie would have ended after the escape, it would have been better. Room is a very good movie with a great story and great acting. If the
second half would have a little better, this would have been a movie
for the ages. Still, Room is definitely worth the watch; 7/10

I have to say that I suffered through this movie in every possible way,
physically, emotionally, psychologically and who knows what else. This movie takes you from being mad and frustrated, to crying nonstop
in seconds. It makes you giggle at some of the innocence that Jack has
and it makes you feel grateful for what you have. It has been one of the best movies I have seen in the year, with
amazing performance from "Ma" and "Jack". It doesn't need the physical
and evident violence to make you feel it. At all times it's possible to
feel the deep, strong shocking life that is being shown.Definitely a movie, that I might not re-watch so often, but for sure
will go into the collection.

A prison is certainly always synonymous with a room where the arrest or
punish someone who has conviction. But what if in fact the prison does
not always serve to restrain an inmate? What if it turns out the prison
is actually a place that offers privacy and comfort for its occupants?
All the questions about prisons, prisoners, and discussed through the
perspective of freedom that could be considered interesting in this
film. "Room" is an adaptation of a Emma Donoghue's best seller novel,
winner of various awards. Emma also wrote the script for this Lenny
Abrahamson (Frank, What Richard Did) movie. "Room" starring Brie
Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy.
I should let you know that this review is contain SPOILER , because it
is difficult to discuss this film without having to mention the
important points on the core story of the film, so it would be better
if you watch the film first before continuing to read."Room" tells the story of Joy (Brie Larson) and his son, who was five
years old, Jack (Jacob Tremblay). They both day-to-day life in a room.
Although the room is not very large area, but it has a volume that was
already enough for lunch Joy and Jack survive. All their basic needs
are there, ranging from bed, TV, dining table, heating, bathtub,
toilet, and a kitchen for cooking. Every day they were also supplied by
Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), even every Sunday, Old Nick will give
something that Joy and Jack want."Room" has a touch of philosophical about life in restraints. We will
continue to be made ​​ thoughtfully and wondered whether the true
meaning of freedom. Through voice over from Jack we will be invited to
see the world from his perspective. Jack, who was born and grew up in
that room would see the world in a different way. For Jack, the world
was limited to the room where he and his mother lived. Therefore all
the things that she had never seen in the room will be considered not
real by Jack. All of it made ​​Jack's perspective on the world to be so
narrow. But Jack actually enjoy it, just enough for him to stay in that
room, all his needs are met, then there is no reason for Jack to look
for something new to the outside world.Meanwhile, Joy has a different problem. Joy was formerly a woman who
had his day with normal, therefore, certainly he will feel tremendous
restraint as a result was confined in the room. His desire to return to
live freely so high. This causes the present conflict between the
characters Joy and Jack, Joy wants freedom, while Jack was very
comfortable with her ​​life and so lazy to look for something new. All
the contradictions and problems are present not just end there.
Entering the second half, "Room" slaps us by presenting the new
problems. Once freed from the room, the character of Joy and Jack are
confronted with a reality that does not match their expectations. Joy
is so wanted freedom, without realizing it now instead turned into
someone trying to curb anything. On the other hand Jack is already very
comfortable living room, to be very surprised and unprepared to face
real life. The outside world was not like what's in Jack's head. It
made ​​Jack becomes difficult to adapt to the existing environment.The two parts in this film makes us so constantly thinking and
contemplating what the real meaning of freedom. When Joy and Jack was
out of the room and get the freedom they want, when they returned it
was also getting a cage with different forms, it is physically they
were freed, but not with their souls. From here we can take a lesson
that freedom or something we want does not always correspond to what we
expect. Sometimes, something that we think is best for us it is
something very bad for us. All contemplation of the meaning of life and
freedom that can be said is full of complexity successfully delivered
well by Emma Donoghue, make all the tricky thing was able to penetrate
easily into the deepest of our hearts, and raises questions that will
continue to arise in our brain.One more element that successfully made ​​"Room" appeared outstanding
is the acting from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Brie performed
perfectly as a woman who "corrupted", we will be able to understand all
the suffering experienced Joy, due to the confined and sexually abused
for seven years. In order to get the maximum results for the play, Brie
Larson made ​​preparations to confine himself for months and do a
strict diet. While Jacob Tremblay success leads us to feel to be a boy
of five years old for the first time seeing the real world, after all
this time just to live in a small room together with her ​​mother. We
will understand why Jack felt fear, wonder, once amazed to see the
outside world that has never been imagined by him earlier. The power of
chemistry presented Brie and Jacob was spelled out very remarkable.
They were like a mother and a child for real, there is no distance and
stiffness that occurs, all flowed very naturally.Brilliant directing from Lenny Abrahamson, the great script from Emma
Donoghue, and a dazzling performance from Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay
success makes "Room" as one of the best film in 2015. "Room" is also an
example of a movie that perfectly successful capture all aspects of
life. We will be laughing, crying, and pondered with him. A movie with
a wonderful floated like a poem from a first class poet.

I remember hearing about the book a long time ago but never got around
to reading it.This film is beautiful. A painful but inspiring story told from the
eyes of a five year old boy who's been raised in a tiny room his whole
life. His mother did the best she could with the tools she had.
Allowing him to believe that the room was the whole world so he didn't
know what he was missing. Until she decided enough was enough and
creates a plan to escape. Amazing performers by both leading actors.
You will cry, you will laugh and you will think about the small things
in life a little differently after seeing this!10/10 amazing.

Brie Larson is Joy, a 24 year-old mother who has been abducted and held
captive in a room for seven years. Her son Jack(Jacob Tremblay, with a
stunningly believable performance) share the screen together for a long
stretch and are absolutely riveting in this heart breaking film. Joy
has somehow been able to teach Jack to read and expanded his vocabulary
to a high level while trapped in hell. Through sheer willpower they
eventually exchange one form of emotional torture for another. The
story does not go the way I expected it to, and this is not a
criticism. Life is not a bowl of cherries with everything working out
in the end. Room is a realistic view of the world carried with two
outstanding leads in Larson and Tremblay. One of the ten best movies of
2015.

Of all the films coming out last year, I would definitely have to say
that Room was one of my most anticipated releases and one of the films
I was most looking forward to. Having now seen the film, I must say
that it did not disappoint. I was mentioning in my review for Brooklyn
about how we are getting a lot of really good female driven films that
have great female performances and great perspectives from a woman's
point of view and I would certainly add Room to that list as well.
Room, is not based upon a true story, but the events in the film were
most likely taken out of the newspaper headlines because we have had a
lot of these cases surface and come to light within the past couple of
years. The film does an excellent job of conveying what being trapped
in a small space would have been like and while the film is quite
disturbing at times and leaves you with an unsettled feeling it is also
emotionally very powerful and also has moments of great beauty and
humanity thrown into the film giving it a wonderful balance of both
tragedy, loss and despair as well as hope and love and knowing that
with time that everything will turn out okay. The two lead performances
from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are amazing and two of the best
performances of this past year, or really any year lately. Larson has
proved what a talented actress she is with films like Short Term 12 and
now Room will definitely be the film she will receive a much deserved
Oscar for. I was really in disbelief though that Jacob Tremblay did not
receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jack. Here is a young
kid who delivered one of the best child performances I think I have
ever seen in a film and he proved himself totally capable of handling
and delivering a performance in what is an emotionally really intense
film and one that I think even people more than half, or triple his age
would find difficulty in doing, but he makes his performance so natural
and believable and we believe every second what he is thinking and
going through and with his total fascination with the world and the
things around him. This was a great oversight for the Academy by not
nominating him because it was certainly one of the top performances of
last year and worthy of an award. I am so glad that Brie Larson was
nominated though and her performance is so great that I know she will
be walking away with Oscar gold. Here is a character who goes through
the unthinkable and yet while she still struggles during and after her
circumstances, we see what a brave and independent woman this is and
how for all the years in captivity she put her young son, Jack and his
needs in front of her own and always looking after his best was just
amazing and completely heart warming to watch. As others have said this
film truly captures the deep and personal relationship between a mother
and son and the endless love that goes with it. Larson's character is
loving and caring for Jack, but we also see how she is strong and even
later in the film while dealing with depression and trauma for what she
went through we are completely with her every step of the way and again
this is such a beautifully natural and realistic performance and one
that must have been extremely emotionally draining and challenging to
play each and every day, but Larson pulls it off flawlessly and is
totally deserving of what is sure to be her first of many Oscars. The
film would unfortunately maybe be too difficult for some to watch
because of the heavy emotional content and the subject matter of the
film, but I would challenge any serious film goers to give the film a
chance anyways because it is such a wonderful cinematic experience and
one that will surely move you and challenge you in many ways. Often
throughout the film as I mentioned earlier, there is also scenes of
love, family and maybe even in a sense coming to terms with yourself
and the events of your life and these such moments did bring tears to
my eyes and deeply moved me. This is a film where we certainly see that
there are a lot of bad people in the world who do terrible things to
one another, but the film does not let us lose hope because we are also
confronted and experience the love between this mother and son and a
relationship that does get challenged, but never broken and the
strength that family and the right people in your life can have. This
is not a film about despair, or the evils of mankind and yet while it
does deal with that, this is overall a film about hope and overcoming
your past and struggles and finding your peace in life even after a
terrible trauma which is further helped by your loved ones. The film is
certainly realistic and gritty at times, but all the more natural and
real because of it and this is one of the most emotional and best
cinematic experiences I have had of last year because we identify with
these characters every step of the way and we feel hope and compassion
for them and in many ways see that the outside world and things in it
are truly beautiful and a wonder to behold and that personal growth and
healing can happen to us all no matter what our circumstances.

I didn't know anything about the movie until the Oscar buzz started. To
say the least, I had my apprehensions before getting into the movie.
Why? Because, I read the synopsis which implied that Brie Larson would
be playing a mother. That didn't make a lot of sense to me, cause until
2 years ago she used to portray the role of teenagers in high school.Anyway, once I did actually start watching the movie, I was totally
captivated by what I saw. The first 10 minutes hook you into the story
and I kept wondering what will happen next?Brie Larson shines in her portrayal of the psychologically petrified,
abused, yet selfless mother who gives everything it takes to protect
and nurture her child. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance,
because prior to this, I've only seen her in 21 Jump Street and
Trainwreck, which are fun and campy movies, but her performance didn't
stand out. Here, her performance is very nuanced and subtle, that it
didn't feel like I was watching a movie, the events were unfolding
in-front of my eyes and most of the credit goes to Larson for giving a
stellar performance.Jacob Tremblay is phenomenal as Jack. Apart from Jacob, part of the
credit goes to the casting directors who chose him, because you can't
easily teach 7-8 year old to act, you need to choose a child whose
demeanor and personality corresponds well with the character he/she
will be portraying so that his performance comes across as natural one.
If they hadn't chosen the right actor to portray Jack, the film
wouldn't be getting the recognition it's getting right now. I'm excited
to see what Jacob does next.The rest of the cast, which included the likes of Joan Allen and Matt
Gordon play their roles beautifully.Lenny Abrahamson is a great storyteller and I'm really pumped to see
what he does next. Let's see if he beats this one.I won't divulge much into the story, cause you need to experience it
for yourself. The IMDb synopsis is enough to give you an idea of what
you would be getting into. My only problem with the movie is that it felt 15 minutes longer than
it should have been. The movie deals with the repercussions of what the
characters endured in the room, which in my opinion was stretched
longer than what would have sufficed.PS. Don't take my word for it, experience it for yourself. You might
even cry at a point in the movie, when the characters achieve
redemption.My Rating: 8.5/10

Really worth watching the movie. Outstanding performances from not only
Brie Larson ( which already brings Oscar) but also Jacob Tremblay. We
can all be surprise how big imagination of the children's can be.
~spoiler~ Grandma referring the room: Wasn't it awfully small? Child
replies: It went every direction,all the way to the end. It never
finished. I love the story and the movie. Yes we all love happy
endings. However, the story reminds us that such stories can be real
and we are not lucky to always have happy endings. Hope, that this
story will not be only for having a great 2 hours and we show our
sensitiveness for such realities.

I rarely give 10 scores. This film is so well-written and well-acted,
and is so emotionally true and harrowing, it deserves the top score.Much of the movie takes place in the "Room," where we see the
relationship between the mother and son and the great lengths to which
she goes to make her son survive emotionally. The escape scene is
harrowing, which just goes to show you don't need special effects or
superheroes for suspense; in fact, there is more suspense without them.
I was expecting more of a grim story, but even though the subject is
grim, this movie is about survival and it could be seen as uplifting.
There is a complete lack of sensationalism, which I appreciated. Brie
Larson is phenomenal. One of the best films of the year.

I always enjoy reading books before they become motion pictures. More
often than not, the film does not hold up to my interpretation and
visuals created by the source material. In this case, the movie hit
every note necessary from the book and any omissions went unnoticed.
While I don't like when movie adaptations alter too much of the story
line, I would have liked to have seen a few more creative decisions
made to enhance the story in a way that only the film format could have
done with the story. Overall, a small criticism in a film that was
superbly acted and executed. The story required extraordinary
performances to give the story justice, and both both Larson and
Tremblay turned in two of the best performances of the year,

*** IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS FILM - DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER AND TRY
TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SYNOPSIS' - THE TRAILER ESPECIALLY SPOILS WAY TOO
MUCH AND GOING IN AS BLIND AS POSSIBLE IS THE BEST WAY TO EXPERIENCE
THIS MOVIE***'Room' is a Drama that focuses on the relationship between a mother and
her 5 year old boy as they are trapped within the walls of a single
room with no signs of ever getting out. This movie was truly amazing,
it was intense, emotional, had a beautiful, unpredictable and gripping
story, fantastically written characters backed up by even more
incredible performances, and was directed and shot amazingly. The plot
of the film was amazing in terms of the events of the film, but where
it really shines is when it explores this very interesting and unique
relationship between Jack and his Mum, and you get to understand these
very fleshed out characters and learn a lot about them. I was
completely mesmerised from start to finish and not once was i bored, as
the story of these characters is so emotional, heartbreaking,
heartwarming, and dramatic that you care for them as if they are real
people. Going into this film without seeing the trailer made this film
infinitely more enjoyable and surprising. There were sequences that
made me feel ways that no other film ever has. I have experienced
intense edge of seat moments in films before but there were part(s) of
this film where i could feel my heart beating like crazy and no other
film had ever done that before. That is really a testament also to the
amazing directing by Lenny Abrahamson, i have not seen his other films
but the way he captures all of the emotion and all of the drama in such
a unique and effective way makes me interested to see what he works on
next. The way the film was shot was so confronting that you feel like
you are going through everything with these characters, and that you
are trapped in this room with them. The performances from both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were
absolutely phenomenal. They delivered every line and gave off every
emotion so perfectly that it sucks you into the film and it makes
everything incredibly grounded, realistic, and personal. Brie Larson
was astounding, you could tell her character was very damaged, and you
didn't need much of an explanation of what she has been through, simply
from the way she talks and acts in certain scenarios you can gather a
lot of information about her past, and that shows how amazing she was
in this film. But even more surprising was the astounding performance
by Jacob Tremblay, this kid is going places, usually you have child
actors who show signs of being great but never really make it, but this
kid has just put in what is probably my favourite performance from a
child actor ever. He commands the screen in every scene and was one of
the biggest highlights of the film. But even more astounding was that
neither one overshadows the other and both of their amazing
performances are front and center the whole time. So overall this is an incredible film, from the directing to the
performances, to the plot, everything tied together really well and
made for a very gripping, dramatic and intense story. Late in the film
it does get a few pacing issues here and there but nothing so
substantial as to dampen my overall enjoyment. This is a must see film,
and although it will most likely not win Best Picture, i think it is
the dark horse in the competition. 9.3/10

Joy was kidnapped 7 years ago: since then she has lived in a single
room with her 5-year old son (by her kidnapper) Jack. On finally
escaping, both mother and son need to connect to a world which has
moved on for Joy, and which Jack has never known.This is a psychological drama on three acts: there is an expository
section which shows us the limits of Joy's and Jack's world (and, as it
is the only world Jack has ever known, it is perfectly normal to him),
then there is the drama and excitement of the escape and, finally,
there is a lengthy section in which we see what happens afterwards.
This final section was the part I loved because it simply plays with
your emotions as you follow the progress of Joy and Jack, and Joy's
family, as they meet assorted issues which must be dealt with.Brie Larson as Joy ("Ma") is wonderful, and young Jacob Tremblay as
Jack is simply astonishing. Jack is a complex character and far from
easy to play, but you never for a second think you are watching a child
acting: Tremblay IS Jack.This is an excellent film.

Room, directed by Lenny Abrahamson, is a magical film about the big
world inside a small room and the big world which proves to be a small
room, as a mother and son escapes into the real world after years of
being captivated in a room.As the film begins, we meet Joy Newsmen (Brie Larson) and her 5-year
old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who are locked up inside a small room by
their captor Nick (Sean Bridgers). Enraged by Jack's perception of the
outside world, Joy devises a plan to get them out, which succeeds. The
rest of the film deals with them trying to adjust with the world,
painting a thoughtful irony on how the bigger world is also a tiny
room, but also teaching us the luxury of life that we have, which often
goes unappreciated.The film explores and depth-fully portrays the connection between a
mother and child, making us feel connected with our own mothers and
children. The characters are portrayed so realistically, will all the
actors doing an unbelievable job that we find ourselves wondering if
they are real, just as Jack wonders what is real and what is not.Although the film's genre is Drama, Abrahamsson has presented the film
in such a way that it offers zero-drama, which at times goes to the
extent that it seems so real, as if it was a recording of a real life
event. Emma Donoghue's writing seems to be based on a true story, and
the fact that is not can be only be explained as "magical".Well balanced with scenes that will make you cry and scenes that will
make you cheerfully delighted, and the morals that it offers, Room is a
must-watch masterpiece, that is deep, lively, and thoughtful, and will
undoubtedly room you in its infinite wisdom with only a few characters
and limited space.

'Room' tackles a very dark and complex subject matter. It is centred on
a fictional incident of a man abducting, imprisoning and raping a young
woman for several years. There are many ways a writer or a filmmaker
could approach this topic. Some may choose to play up the abuse to
invoke a visceral reaction from the audience while others may focus on
the resulting media blitz. 'Room' does depict both the abuse and the media reaction but it does
not dwell on them. Instead, its main focus is the relationship between
the woman, Joy, and the son she birthed in captivity, Jack. This is a
great way to approach the premise as it allows the audience to get to
know them, which makes us care for them. In some moments, I found
myself rooting for the characters and hoping that they would succeed.
In others, I felt bad for them when they irrationally acted out in
anger instead of feeling annoyed. These well-developed characters are
brought to life further by two very strong performances. Brie Larson
(Joy) and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) bring out the emotional depth to their
characters that makes us empathise with them. Although Larson has been touted as the lead of the film, Joy shares the
position of protagonist with Jack. Many shots were filmed at low angles
including those from Jack's point of view, allowing us to see the world
from his perspective. This directing choice also makes Room, the name
Joy and Jack gave to the garden shed that acts as their prison, seem a
lot bigger than it actually is, reflecting how it makes up the entirety
of Jack's world. To top it off, there are montages that feature voice-over narration by
Jack, which reflects the images on screen. Unfortunately, I found
myself focusing on the visuals and missing the narration. I don't know
for sure why I did this. Maybe I wasn't in the mood to listen to prose
read aloud. I'll have to wait for my second viewing to get a definite
answer.The one complaint I have that does feel definite  although minor  is
the music that accompanied the start of an important sequence. The
piece of music was designed to be emotional and intense in a way that
would be more appropriate for the climax of such a sequence.
Fortunately, the sequence did become emotional and intense as it
progressed. I admittedly find it difficult to connect with characters
on an emotional level but the time spent developing the characters made
me feel the impact of this scene.I will need to watch this film again before saying I loved it but I
definitely liked it a lot. If you are looking for an emotional film
with strongly written and acted characters, seek 'Room' out when you
can.

This is a dazzling movie.The film is superbly built; the first half is set within 'Room'; for
Joy (Brie Larson) it is the shed where she's been held hostage, for her
little boy Jack (Jacob Tremblay) it is the only world he knows. Joy has
told him that the only thing outside of Room is outer-space and
anything seen on TV only exists in TV-land. One of the most intriguing
aspects of the film is the contrasting lenses through which Joy and
Jack look at the world and specifically Room. For Jack it's all he's
ever known; he affectionately names each object - sink, bath, plant,
wardrobe. For Joy, it represents oppression, for Jack, it's life. And
yet, the promise of trees and leaves and dogs is still alluring - Joy
eventually lets Jack in on the truth about 'outside' before hatching a
plan to escape. The intensity rises throughout the opening sequence as
the desperation of their situation becomes more apparent. As Jack plays
dead and their evil captor loads him into a truck wrapped in a carpet,
I have never wanted anything more passionately in a film than for their
plan to succeed - it had to. My heart wouldn't cope if it didn't, such
is the strength of connection that Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay
create through their incredibly forceful and convincing performances.Thankfully their plan did work and the film could easily have ended
here; a story of brutal oppression, despair, hope, uncertainty and
ultimate victory; a classic tale. Mother and son out in the open. Free
with trees and leaves. Granny and Grampa. It would have been a good
film.The reality had far more depth. Joy had escaped; it'd been all she'd
wanted, all she'd thought about but now she was there, she wasn't
happy. Jack wasn't happy either, although his reasons are more
immediately apparent; losing the comfort and security of home and the
close proximity of his Ma. What Joy was processing was far more
nuanced; perhaps an element of guilt-ridden anti-climax, what-now
syndrome, a remorseful and personal look at how life had moved on
without her - her parents had separated and gotten on with their lives.
Did she even matter? Overwhelming insecurities over her parenting
naturally arose.All of this drives her to the edge of death as she attempts to end it
but this moment gives her some perspective. Jack cuts off his hair -
his 'strong' - and sends it to her in hospital. This display of love
and affection empowers Joy and she comes back a stronger, happier woman
and a stronger, happier mum, scarred by trauma unimaginable but on the
road to a better life.It's two magical performances from Larson and Tremblay. It's a
mesmerising tale that is expertly woven together into an exceptional
film. In my opinion is deserves Best Picture and if Larson doesn't win
Best Actress then I will eat my hat and wonder what the world is coming
to.

Experiencing this film, and it is quite the experience, you will see
why actors Brie Larson and Jacob Temblay are receiving accolades left
and right. Director Lenny Abrahamson manages to capture limited space
with beauty and elegance, when neither are in play within this film. He
is helped with this presentation through the terrific writing,
screenplay and novel by Emma Donoghue, who provides the audience a look
inside the world of the missing child. The story, according the
Donoghue, is not based on any one story, but one can't help feel the
story is familiar and current. Within the film there are a variety of
additional stories that make one think, such as News Reporter (Wendy
Creson) Q&A's, the kidnapper's (Sean Bridgers) thought process,
parental (Joan Allen and William H. Macy) accountability, and a whole
lot more. The combination of relatable story lines makes this project
important and relevant. Cinematography by Danny Cohen ("The Danish
Girl") takes the audience inside young Jack's (Temblay') point of view
as he discovers the world he never knew, adding yet another layer to
this amazing film. Don't miss this one!

Simply put, "Room" is an emotional film. And it seems as though half
the time you do not even know what you're feeling. Seamlessly the film
manages to portray happiness in a tragic way, depressingly dark
situations yet present some optimism and make you feel genuinely scared
and/or worried about its fictional characters. Room is emotional in a
very real sense; it's not just another movie where a romance falls
apart, or where a loved one gets a terminal illness and it doesn't tug
on your heart strings with cheap bullshit. Room doesn't try to trick
you into feeling things, its realistic tone and grim story is enough.
Not to make light of the cinematography, music or any of anything else
which made the film, these are all good too, however we are really in
this one for the writing and acting; the story and characters. The film follows its protagonists as they live their day to day lives
trapped inside a small dirty room with no way out. Locked in by a
nameless man that they call 'Old Nick,' The characters are a mother and
son 'Jack,' 'Ma' has been inside this room for seven years and her son
has never experienced anything beyond the room in his life. For around
half of the movie we stay in the room with these characters, we as an
audience never leave the room until the characters do. Personally I was
beginning to feel the claustrophobia myself, the movie makes you feel
as trapped as the characters are. The room feels hopeless as it does
small and the atmosphere is actually quite haunting. Now though, that Jack is five years old, Ma believes that it's now time
and that he is finally old enough to help her make their escape.
Through a series of events, the two do make it out of the room, however
we are still only about half way through the film as we follow their
lives after leaving 'room.' The films point of no return; leaving 'room' is both scary and cheerful
for both us and the characters in the film. The juxtaposition of being
stuck in the room and the freedoms of such an open and unknown world is
mind blowing. Yet, before they leave and it is uncertain whether they
will succeed or not, you almost don't want them to try. Jack pleads his
mother to wait till he is six years old and this is a terrifying theme
throughout the film; Comfort and security over freedom. Jack's life and
world may have been horrible, however the thought of leaving was
frightening and almost made no sense to Jack. The movie manages to portray a horrible situation without feeling like
a cheap horror movie, this is to be taken seriously and manages to
portray despicable acts and conditions of the characters, without
reverting to gross out moments or cartoonish dark villains. The villain
of the film, is definitely disgusting and hateable, but ultimately is
not the point of the film. The maturity of the film dealing with a
sickening character and subject is appreciated. Another running theme
of this film was the experience  or really inexperience of
five-year-old Jack. He'd never known anything beyond this one room his
entire life, basically; 'room' was his world. And this is such an
interesting concept to me. Jack's concepts of fiction and reality blur
and at such an age he is vulnerable to information. It's important to
learn the truth however almost incomprehensible due to his extremely
limited knowledge. Possibly my favourite shot of the film, has Jack creating shadows with
his hands in the partial sunlight that comes through via sunlight. This
shot has obvious relation to 'The Allegory of the Cave' philosophical
theory. Put simply, if a caveman never leaves his cave, and all he ever
sees are shadows, this is what he believes in, this becomes his
reality. And the same goes for the child in the film. 'Room' is all he
knows, and beyond stories he's told or what he sees on their
television, Jack's sense of reality is inaccurate. He knows about
animals such as dogs and cats, he knows about grass and trees and he
knows about general bits of information, however due to his isolation
he cannot separate reality from fiction and therefore will not know
which things are real and which are not. A dragon for example is as
real or fake as a dog in his mind. The themes throughout the film and the emotion that these themes bring
are all portrayed through the actors; who all did a fine job, but the
performance that really stood out was child actor Jacob Tremblay as
Jack. Children are often not the best actors, they're still young;
still learning, but this kid is ahead of his time, ahead of his age
really. For such a thematically complex film as well as a mature and
grim one, Tremblay did an amazing job making me believe in his
character, as well as his collaboration with Brie Larson as mother and
son, their relationship is strong and convincing. The film gave me chills when it needed to in moments of pure intensity
the beautiful moments were made that much nicer in comparison to the
dreary and depressing ones. It even gave me a new perspective on the
world and the way we might look at it. What if we are all experiencing
some version of Jack and Ma's 'room?' But, this is just a movie review,
I don't want to get too philosophical. "Room" is saddening yet uplifting. It may be hard to watch for some yet
I'd think also hard to stop watching, and overall the film has the
ability to change ones' perspective. "Room" is shocking, yet beautiful
and most of all unforgettable. This is Drama at its' best. 10/10

A fantastic feat in directorial achievement from Lenny Abrahamson, Room
gives the audience a front row seat to the power of love and
unrelenting devotion. Revealing the commanding force of love between a
mother and her son when they are the only two people in their world,
Room is an incredible tribute to the essence of human existence. The
first half of the movie is filmed in the garden shed prison shared by
the captives, proving Lenny Abrahamson to be a phenomenal director more
than capable of creating a powerful film with little space. If you see
no other Best Picture Nominee from this year's Academy Awards, please
see Room; for it is truly the most captivating piece of art up for this
year's top prize.The audience is immediately thrust into the gripping story of Ma, who
used to be known as Joy (Brie Larson), and her son Jack (Jacob
Trembley) prisoners in a reinforced garden shed attempting to
"celebrate" Jack's fifth Birthday. We soon learn that Joy was kidnapped
7 years before by a man, only known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) who is
holding them hostage. Repeatedly raped, Joy gave birth to a son since
her kidnapping. Jack and Ma, as he calls Joy, are never allowed to
leave the shed, called Room, and Jack has not seen the outside world in
his entire life. With as active an imagination as any 5 year old boy,
Ma tells Jack stories to keep him entertained and distracted from the
grim reality in which they live; a reality where pants are treats only
delivered one day a week. Reaching the end of her psychological rope,
Ma devises a plan to save herself and Jack, allow her to return to life
in the outside world, and give Jack a proper childhood among family and
friends, trees, wind, and even bugs. Escaping Room proves to be more
daunting than happy, as Joy has lived in constructed isolation for so
long that her adjustment to the outside is difficult. Jack, having
almost no immune system, must make an extremely careful entry into the
world; a world that he has only been introduced to in his 5 years of
life to an old television with a blurry picture. Seeing everything the
world has to offer proves overwhelming for Jack and he seeks out Ma
more than ever. Rediscovering and creating human identity, rejoining
family and friends and a normal life, and creating a life for Jack
illustrate the journey that one woman will traverse to give everything
possible to her little boy.Brie Larson is one of the year's standouts this year in the role of the
embattled, psychologically exhausted Ma. She eloquently displays the
desperate yearning for life outside the garden shed, yet shows her
complacency of not seeing a way out in extraordinary fashion. The child
actor, Jacob Tremblay was also a force as the boy whose entire life has
been lived in four walls. He excels when he shows the wonder of a 5
year old out in the world that he has never had the opportunity to
experience. The two work together so well, and develop a compassionate
chemistry on screen, creating a truly powerful experience for the
audience. Watching the two only have each other, desperate for things
among everyday life that seem so inconsequential was an incredible
experience.Identity and love are the cornerstones explored in Room. Joy lost her
identity once she was kidnapped; she is then tasked with creating a new
one for herself and her son in order to simply be able to live through
their shared experience as captives. Jack, on the other hand, is robbed
of developing his own identity apart from his mother. Once out of room,
he is exposed to parts of the world he thought didn't truly exist, and
being in contact with all of life's wonders in such a short amount of
time was magical, yet overwhelming for the young boy. The depths of
love explored in this movie are unparalleled by any other film in 2015.
Constantly having her body violated, Joy became pregnant by her captor,
eventually delivering the baby inside the garden shed. This all happens
off-screen, but is a difficult concept for the viewer. Able to look
past the harrowing truth behind Jack's conception, Joy loves him and
would stop at nothing to protect him. Likewise, Ma is the only person
Jack has ever known, his autonomy is solely based within her, and he is
so devoted to his mother that he keeps a tooth of hers that fell out in
his mouth so he always has a piece of her. Compelling is the story of
how deep love lives within human beings, despite the circumstances we
encounter.Without question, Room is the standout as far as art pieces recognized
by the Academy for their top prize this year. (I am still upset that
they missed out on recognizing Carol) I sincerely hope that Room pulls
out a dark horse victory for the highest honor this year. If nothing
else, I hope that Todd Haynes wins a statuette for Best Director, as
the range he gained from the two actors inside four walls is unmatched
in skill and product. A gripping tale of love and identity among
on-going psychological hell, Room is uncontested in delivering its
message. One can only cross their fingers that The Academy gets this
one right.

I found "Room" to be a wonderful movie. It's the typical story of the
teenager who gets kidnap one the way home from school and spends years
locked in a room by her captor. During those years she gets pregnant of
her captor and give birth to a child that becomes her reason to
survive. Upto this point it's a story that has already been told a
million times, but, here comes the spark of this movie, this one is
told from the child's (born in captivity) point of view. From the first
scene on, the director takes us on trip inside this little 5 year old
kid. How he structures his word, his conception of what the word is,
and isn't. What is real, what is imagination, what is TV, and so. On
the side we see an extremely strong Mom who somehow managed to make of
that terrible reality a happy one for her child. And then they finally
get out and the movie starts... A wonderful movie indeed. I strongly
recommend this movie to all psychology students or those who are
interested in such topics. An already told story from a whole different
point of view. Totally worth watching!

A story of a five-year-old boy and his mother escaped from their little
world and found new discoveries.I can't talk more because I might spoil it.This is an inspiring and empowering movie. Gives you an impression of
innocence. It has the ability to make you cry, laugh and be thrilled.
Combine this with the great and artistic cinematography. The story line
has smooth transition and was executed perfectly. The plot and
character development jives together which makes this a more watchable
movie than any other non-animated-character-driven movie.As an audience, I don't have a problem with this movie.This is one of the best movies of 2015. You must watch it.

Room was a film that i was very intrigued to see to the extent i
actually did go out of my way to see it. I knew barely anything about
it, i had seen the trailer a good few times in front of other movies
but i never looked into it a great deal. It is one of those rare films
that never strikes as something that would be worth going out of the
way for, until it is actually released and then you think about it and
realise you in fact do want to see it because it peaked my interest a
great deal. With that being said, i do not regret my decision. It is a
film i highly recommend in fact.First of all, Brie Larson stars as the main character, a young woman
who was abducted from a young age and is forced to raise her son who is
now five years old in a confined space that they deem 'room'. She gives
us an incredible performance, i had only really seen her as Jonah
Hill's love interest in 21 Jump Street, but she is so different here
that it is hard to recognise her without prior knowledge of who she is.
The stand out however is young Jacob Tremblay who plays the young boy
Jack. I will say this now, he is really going places and will be a big
star in the future if he carries on with performances like this. As a
child actor his performance sucked me in as much as the big nominations
currently in the Oscars. Whilst being vague, when you actually get to
see him experience the outside world for the first time it really
brought tears to my eyes because he plays the role in such a way that
you really believe he has only known that one plave his whole life. For
example he sees 'Old Nick' (the man who is keeping them captive) as a
sort of magical being who brings them clothes etc. Because he has never
even seen another person in his life. This makes it all the more
interesting when he experiences real life people for the first time.At it's core the film is really a powerful story about the bond between
a mother and son, but as well as this it is a metaphor for life itself
and how we can take it for granted. With such amazing performances from
the two leads it became something really special and whilst it is
shocking and heartwrenching in places by the end it becomes a real
uplifting, inspiring gem. As much as it may be tempting to ignore this
film in favour of all the terrible comedies January is notable for,
please don't. This is a film that must be seen. When i first saw it i
thought maybe it dragged on 5 minutes too long, but in fact looking
back i wouldn't take anything out. It shows us that nothing is more
powerful than love and for that alone it deserves to be seen.

Room is the splendid unique film that explores the world through the
eyes of Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Only knowing the environment of one
confined space, the young boy and his mother are welcomed back into
society, where Jack slowly begins to discover a whole new planet.This storyline is so cleaver and heartwarming, as it explores mothering
relationships, childhood, and discovery. Brie Larson is amazing as
being the perfect mother in an imperfect situation, her winning leading
actress at the Oscars would be no surprise. And of course Jacob
Tremblay plays the wonderful, adorable, real Jack who is so convincing
in his performance if it wasn't for Revenant he deserves the Oscar. His
performance brings you in to the film and makes you feel like
discovering the world for the first time.The whole film is uniquely shot, and feels completely new and different
to other films. It makes way for all the emotion that is to come.To the middle of the film it begins to get a bit slow for me, but that
is really part of the narrative.In my Oscars list I will hope Brie Larson wins that award, and for the
screenplay, but for the moment the big won for me is hoping to go to
the Revenant. However Room is beautiful film that will make you draw
tears three times and is a clear 9/10.

I did not really know what to expect before going to see this one. I
certainly didn't expect the film to cause me to cry so much. It's a
powerfully emotional experience and wonderfully performed. To say
anything to spoil the plot robs you of the surprise this film is, so
please try and avoid any description of the plot. It will give you the
wrong idea anyway. But go see it! Brie Larson is so good - and the
story so immersive. Can't recommended highly enough. also, William H
Macey gives a great turn in a small role, but one that packs so much
punch I don't think I can forget that moment. It's strange, whilst wa
thing the film I was so moved but had no desire to watch it again -
because I didn't want to feel so moved again. But now I'm planning on
going back.

Room is one of those film that is hard to talk about without disclosing
what happens in the film but basically it's the story of a mother and
child who have been held captive in a room and when they get the chance
to escape the boy finds the word outside that he was always told wasn't
real. It's a wonderfully acted drama that has you thinking throughout .
You think the worst has happened but perhaps the worst is yet to come ,
especially for the young boy ? Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are
superb as the two leads and understandably this has got a lot of
accolades since it's release. I think it's one of those films that I
will like even more the more when I think about it and look back on it.

Here's a small budget movie that will top the lists of 10 Best of the
year. Award worthy performances make it work. While Bri Larson is
excellent and billed as the lead, Jacob Tremblay carries the movie. It
is really his story. He is on screen in nearly every scene and does all
the voice overs. It is the discovery of the world through his eyes that
raise the movie above harsh drama.The writer gets the credit for the good and perhaps the blame for some
things that were so heavy handed red flags nearly popped off the
screen. Perhaps it was better developed in the book but the William H.
Macy character and issue felt rushed and distracting. The Dr. handing
out sleeping pills when sleeping wasn't an issue was a jolting red
flag. The news reporter interview was so far in bad taste to be
realistic. Both mom and attorney sat by to set up another unlikely
scene. The male characters were all written as insensitive clods. That
includes the male cop. Even the male dog while kind sure wasn't much to
look at.Ignore the flaws and admire the performances. The movie may be hard for
some to take as it deals with abuse issues and aftermath. It is in
limited release so if you can't see it in the dark, it will be almost
as effective on a home platform. See it somewhere as it one of the best
movies of the year.

This is my review of the ever so uplifting Room (spoiler free)Cast: Academy Award nominee Brie Larson*, Jacob Tremblay and 3 time
Academy Award nominee Joan Allen.Plot: Ma (Larson) is kidnapped at the age of seventeen and she is kept
prisoner in a 10 foot room in a garden shed. She is constantly trying
to escape her prison while her son, 5 year old Jack (Tremblay) is
always wondering about the outside world.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson known for the quirky yet witty comedy
Frank (2013). Room is a truly inspirational story and is always
heartwarming from start to finish.Brie Larson (Trainwreck) has always been threatening to outbreak and in
this film she does exactly that, however nine year old Jacob Tremblay's
performance is beyond awe-inspiring, normally a child actor is only
ever as good as their director but that is not the case in this
feelgood and at points heartbreaking picture.This film literally open's a new door in the art of film making and
will have you gripped from start to finish, this film will make you
smile or make you cry, it will grab you by the heart and it will never
let go. This is a film that is painful to watch I completely 100% recommend it,
in my opinion this one of the best films of the year and it is a must
see, even though it is very painful to watch at some points I think
this is a total masterpiece 10/10. Just perfect.*Best performance by an actress in a leading role Room, 2015

Room is easily one of the most emotionally devastating movies i have
ever seen. Period.It completely draws you into this world that both of its characters
inhabits and never lets go. The story of a mother and son kidnapped and
living in a room for years is equally haunting and beautiful.Movies of kidnapped inhabitants are a dime a dozen these days, but what
makes Room so special is the realistic and empathetic approach to its
story. The "villain" isn't astonishingly evil, but frighteningly real.So is Joy, the mother of Jack. She isn't Jason Bourne, she has no
particular set of skills. All she has is her love for her son and that
keeps her going for the both of them. Instead of focusing on the
gruesome details of rape, abuse and kidnapping, Room chooses to focus
on the humans in the story, and their survival through mutual love.You might be surprised most by Jack, the boy who grew up in Room. You
cant help but be heartbroken as you see how much he loves the jail cell
he grew up in. Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson both give performances
for the ages. As is the direction and music. This could have so easily
fallen into the cliché revenge plot or melodrama, but it never falls
into those trappings.Visually, the movie intentionally traps you into the Room for the first
half, never letting you see outside of it. It really makes you feel the
characters predicament and the "Room" itself becomes a character.Of course, they do escape as written in the plot, and i wont spoil what
happens after. Just know that the performances are incredible, and you
will leave the cinema with memories of this film that will stick with
you. You will remember Joy, Jack, and Room.As the hype for Room increases, i suspect certain audiences might leave
slightly disappointed from how grounded and realistic the film is. No,
there is no twist, no gimmicks and no flashy moment or revenge plot.
And the film is all the more better for it.Despite its subject matter, Room manages to inspire, and is
surprisingly heartwarming. I didn't expect myself to love the film that
much but i can say wholeheartedly that this film is a triumph of human
emotion and it is the must see movie of 2015.

Movies have the ability to transport you to many places. Places that
are familiar, places that are strange and different or places you would
not visit otherwise. It can take you to "A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy
Far, Far Away", or it can take you to visit the "Pirates of the
Caribbean" or, sometimes - if you are very lucky - it will take you to
ROOM.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, ROOM tells the story of "Ma" (Brie
Larson) who, as the movie begins, has been held hostage for 7 years in
a windowless 10x10 enclosure. She has dubbed this enclosure "ROOM" for
the benefit of her 5 year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who is held
imprisoned with her. The first half of the movie takes place entirely
in this enclosure where Ma has helped create a world for Jack. It is
very much Ma taking care of Jack. The second half of the movie takes
place "afterward" (I will not spoil anything here).Ms. Larson, in her Oscar nominated role, is fantastic as Ma, imbuing
her character with the right combination of strength and weakness of
one imprisoned for so long, but you can see the love she has for her
son and that she will do anything to protect him. While the first half
of the movie is worthy of her Oscar nomination (and Oscar frontrunner
status), it is the realistic affects to Ma (who we find out is named,
ironically, Joy) during "afterwards" that really cement the role. We
don't see a "superwoman" here, we see a real person dealing with a
traumatic event and it's aftermath. She is ably assisted by strong
turns by Joan Allen and William H. Macy as her parents, as well as Tom
McCamus as "Leo".The surprise for me is how strong a performance 9 year old Jacob
Tremblay gave as 5 year old Jack. While Larson, rightfully so, is
receiving critical acclaim, I am surprised that Tremblay isn't
receiving more. Larson is the rock of the first half of the movie, but
it is Tremblay who holds the 2nd half of the movie together. Jack's
warm and loving soul radiates throughout the back half and keeps things
together when it looks like things are falling apart.Director Abrahamson gives a strong hand to the proceedings, having us
focus on just what we need to focus on without it becoming too
depressing, maudlin or sappy. He knows when to pull in and when to pull
out and has you rooting for these characters from the start.This movie is not for everyone and I am sure that more than 1 person
will have a tough time making it all the way through it (I had a strong
desire to go home and hug my family afterward, much to my son's
chagrin). I was warmed by the strong love of mother and son and how it
takes a subject that could have been a downer and has made it
heartwarming and life affirming.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)

ROOM:  poses an interesting question: How does a five year old boy,
Jack (an excellent Jacob Tremblay) comprehend and react to a world he's
never seen? He and his mother have been held captive in a 10 X 12 shed
with a skylight his entire life. His only contact with the outside
world is a distorted picture on an old TV and the sky. His only human
contact is his captor and his mother who's been held for seven years.
He perceives most things as a two dimensional TV image. She must help
him differentiate between what is real and what is fantasy. He's never
seen a tree, a car or a building. He's a healthy, bright kid who must
sleep in a wardrobe while his captor visits nightly to rape his mother
(Brie Larson). She devises a successful plan to help them escape. The
always wonderful Joan Allen plays his maternal grandmother and with
gentle love and encouragement, helps Jack find his way in a very
strange world. He's never seen stairs Larson is excellent as the mom.
Room, is disturbing to say the least but director Lenny Abrahamson lets
the story unfold at a nice pace and lets us see the desperation of
their situation without letting it get maudlin. Score: 8. GO.

If you get to watch just one film this year, let it be this one. Hell,
I'd say if you have to watch just one film in your lifetime, choose
this one. This movie shows what the power of love can accomplish. And
not just any love.. A mother's love; the purest, warmest, selfless
thing in the whole world.ROOM is a rare gem... A kind of movie that would make even the cruelest
of hearts kind. I am not kidding. If you want to change yourself, if
you want to become a better person, just spare two hours of your time
and watch this movie. It makes you realize how precious a thing love
is.. And how unfortunate and ungrateful we are to take it for granted
and not cherish it as much as it deserves to be cherished. Thank you so much everyone who was involved in making this film. You
guys have created a gift for the humanity. And the actors.. Wow! Where
to even begin! Brie Larson gave the perfect performance. She nailed
every emotion, every vulnerability, and deserves all the awards for it,
no doubt. And the little kid was just breathtakingly good! Seriously I
mean.. Not once did it even feel like we were watching a boy who was
acting! It was so real. The supporting cast added to the amazing work
and helped make the film a modern classic. Once again, thank you all of
the people who helped make ROOM a reality. Bravo! I pray that all of the moms in the world get everything they desire and
may all their wishes come true. =)

The best movie of the year by a mile. Arguably the best movie of 2010's
till now. One of the most brilliant movies that has ever been put on
screen. The world from child's perspective is innocent and hopeful and
at the same time enlightening. In my humble opinion, the kid gives the
best performance of the year excluding Rooney Mara in Carol. The movie
has so many strong scenes that keep your heart racing, and literally
make you cry. A great book to screen adaption by author Emma Donnoghue
and Lenny Abrahamson. The production house A24 has been doing really
good this year, 1st with Ex Machina and now with Room. Brie Larson is
finally getting the attention that she deserves thanks to the movie,
although I liked her performance in Short Term 12 way better.

"Room" (2015)Director: Lenny AbrahamsonStarring: Brie Larson, Jacob TremblayReviewer Grade: 8ishReviewer: Lane FortenberryIt's fascinating to listen to a child's take on the world. It brings
laughter to hear what they believe certain things represent and what
those objects actually do. The adults would then correct the child and
explain what it really is and what's really out there. Normally, adults
don't have to do this twice  in two different worlds.In "Room," well, it is a different world. Young Jack (Jacob Tremblay)
is locked up in a shed, known as "Room," with his mother, or Ma (Brie
Larson). They survive with the necessities, basic food, plumbing, a
bed, but have no contact with the outside world. Old Nick (Sean
Bridgers), who is responsible for locking them away, brings supplies
through a password-protected door. The only natural light comes through
a skylight atop the shed.Jack believes everything on TV is magic and doesn't truly exist. He
believes there is only Room, like it's on its very own planet.
Voice-overs are provided by Jack explaining what's going on inside his
head, and what everything means to him. He has a fear of ever going
outside, but must if he and Ma plan on escaping to a better life. Jack
is almost born twice, and experiences the world twice  once in his own
and then the real one. A bond between a mother and her child can never
be broken.Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay shine so brightly in "Room." Larson
is emotional, understanding and at the same time expresses the
exhaustion of raising a child, especially one who has never had
exposure to the real world. She's genuinely authentic and outstanding.
It's going to be a real competition for Best Actress between her and
Saoirse Ronan.Tremblay shows his bright future as an exceptionally talented young
actor. You will fall in love with this boy and truly feel for him and
what he undergoes during the film. His voice-overs are hilarious, but
saddening at the same time. The writing was superb for his character.
There are no flaws with the rest of the cast, as well."Room" does such a fabulous job with letting us see a child grow up in
this unfortunate, but unique circumstance. We have no idea how we would
coup with such an experience and the psychology behind it. Being in
that situation would be ever so frustrating, but Larson handles and
deals with it the only way it could be dealt with. It's another
beautiful film from A24.Check out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!

From the very first scene to the last, scene by scene is well carved
and crafted. This movie gives scrupulous details to almost everything
that has screen time, starting from the character's outfit to the every
bit of emotion they felt on the screen. Hats off to the director, he is
such a genius. The plot is a bit slow, still I neither felt distracted
nor bored. It is a worthy watch. This dramatic movie is a window to
look into our own emotions. And also makes us to think in a different
dimension all together. It forces us to wear their shoes and walk a
mile to feel exactly how they feel. P.S If you didn't cry after watching this movie then you don't love
your mother as much as I love mine.

This movie is just brilliant! I didn't know anything about it before
watching it, but it was truly a wonderful surprise. I won't tell
anything about the plot cause i think this movie can really be
appreciate if you watch it knowing nothing (or almost) about it before.
I've never felt so emotional watching a film, it was heartbreaking and
it's truly one of those movie that you can't stop thinking about after
you watch it. Everyone involved did a great job, but Brie Larson and
Jacob Trembley were just terrific, their dynamic was amazing and they
deserve all the recognition they get. I honestly cannot recommend this
movie enough!

Because of me being an idiot, I finished reading the book Room
literally an hour before I saw the movie. The good side of this was the
novel was still in my head, but the bad side was also that the novel
was still very much in my head. Usually when this happens, you become
critical as you constantly go "Where's this bit? Where's that bit?".
The novel is pretty intact with this adaptation, and is also a pretty
much perfect adaptation.A lot of Jack's internal monologues are narrowed down, obviously as
this is a visual medium and not a novel where you can get away with
this, and this shows how Emma Donaghue takes over lovingly crafted
novel and makes it work with a film format. And when she has produced
the script with the same tone and sensibility, albeit with some scenes
appearing slightly shortened (notably the interview scene, which in the
book brought me to tears and felt a little hastened here), she gives
that script to very talented people to bring to life. Irish director
Lenny Abrahamson shoots the movie with very tight shots - around 80% of
the shots are ECUs or CUs, which is mixed with a cooler pallet to make
the world seem cold, and as the movie ends, we see a final wide shot of
our two main characters walking from the camera to give a great
resolve. It's a very tight, clever piece of storytelling with
camera-work. The cast are also stellar. Joan Allen features prominently
as Jack's grandmother, and is great as a woman who's trying her best to
warm to and love Jack whilst also making her own daughter's return to
the world more accessible and is great, Tom McCamus plays 'steppa' Leo
who is the first person to really coax Jack out of his shell, and uses
his warming and caring voice, and subtle, gentle expressions to gain
his affection. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick, the captor and creator of
Room; Sean Bridgers deserves a lot of credit for being genuinely
repulsive, despite only being seen a small number of scenes, and for
creating a quiet unassuming quality about him - that no-one would ever
expect him - while also being horrifically calm with everything he's
done. Now onto the main players: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Brie
Larson has come a long way since Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim, and she
creates a TOTALLY realistic portrayal of a traumatised woman who is
also a genuinely loving person/parent. In her already mentioned
interview scene, where she's asked horrifically insensitive questions
to provoke, your heart breaks for her. As Jack, Jacob is our eyes of
the movie as we follow him wherever he goes, and he's so adorable yet
wise in his way; he says things like his "strong" is in his hair, like
Samson, and you find it utterly adorable and endearing at the same
time. He is really good, and it's good he is because if he wasn't then
whole movie fails.I can't think of any flaws with the movie at all actually, and if there
are they are pretty minor. There are obviously differences with the
novel, which is always frustrating BUT as a movie, this is perfect.
Brie Larson is particularly wonderful, as is the script and the
minimalistic movie score. Hopefully Oscar for Brie, and all around good
things for this movie.

Room completely blew all of my initial expectations away with a very
empathetic and human story with phenomenal performances from its two
leads, as well as an incredible screenplay and fantastic direction.Going into Room as someone who didn't read the book that this film was
based on, I was expecting a mystery/thriller that centered around the
escape/finding of the mom and son that the film focuses on. Instead,
what I got was a very emotional, and very human look at the
relationship between a mother and her son, as well as how these two are
damaged by what they've experienced within a very confined space, and
how they recover from and cope with said damage. Emma Donoghue, who
wrote the book that this film is based on, did a beautiful job writing
the screenplay, and part of that is because these characters she
created felt like real people with real problems that pretty much
anybody can relate to no matter who they are.However, the characters wouldn't have been so realistic if it wasn't
for the actors who play them. Brie Larson is an absolute revelation,
and is, in my opinion, the front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar this
February. I've always been a fan of her's, from her commercial work in
films like Trainwreck, 21 Jump Street, or Scott Pilgrim vs. The World,
to her smaller work in films like Short Term 12 or Don Jon. Her
performance in Room is some of the absolute best work I've ever seen
from her, and this is because she portrays the shock and stress of
returning to a world that's been snatched away from you for seven years
so brilliantly. She captures the heartbreak, and sadness, and anger of
this sobering situation perfectly, and it shows it the incredible
transformation her character undergoes throughout the film. As great as Larson is in this film though, it would be unfair to
overlook her son played by Jacob Tremblay, who is as important as
Larson is, possibly even more. This is because Jack is the character
that the audience sees the film through; he's the person that guides us
all through the events that take place. And that is absolutely
fascinating to me, because essentially Jack is experiencing the world
for the first time ever. So because of this, he is filled with wonder
about this new world, especially in a fantastic scene involving him
laying in the bed of a truck looking at the sky, and the score is just
overwhelming the entire scene with how loud it is. And that's the other
thing about him; he's overwhelmed and apprehensive about what the world
holds, but he doesn't always understand why. And as an audience member,
we're able to piece extra bits of the story together without being
told, but instead shown what things are like. When you're able to
understand something without having to explain it, that's great
storytelling, and it makes the character of Jack one of the most
fascinating of the entire year.This film wouldn't be what it was without its director, Lenny
Abrahamson. I've heard that Abrahamson took a lot of inspiration from
learning how to raise a family for directing this film, and it really
shows in every scene that he directs. You really get the sense that
this was a film that was made with care, and love, and not just towards
the respect that the book and its characters deserve, but in crafting
something that felt genuine, that felt relatable to anyone who
experienced growing up or raising their child. It feels like the
director just wanted to tell a good, relatable story with the material
that he was given, and he did just that.Room is a movie that really affected me. I'm notorious for literally
never crying in movies, but in Room, I cried for literally the entire
second half of the film. And that's because the characters of Ma and
Jack, what they go through, and particularly how this affects other
people that Ma knew before being taken away from the world she once
lived in, felt so real to me; I actually believed that these events
actually happened. And when a film does that to me, it's film that I
know that I'll be revisiting time and time again, and Room is exactly
that kind of movie. If I had seen this before the end of 2015, it would've been my favorite
movie of the entire year. Without a doubt.

At the start of the film Jack (Jacob Tremblay), the five year old
protagonist and from whose perspective the story is told, has spent his
entire life trapped in a ten foot by ten foot room. His mother (Brie
Larson) has raised him with the belief that the room they live in is
the entire world. She does so to protect him from the fact that they
are prisoners, held captive by a man who uses her as a sex slave.
Dealing with subject matter that could easily tip over either to
unbearable bleakness or cliché melodrama, director Lenny Abrahamson,
writer Emma Donoghue and the two excellent actors do an incredible job
at creating a film that feels both honest and empathetic. A number of
intelligent decisions in presenting the material are made, including
telling the story from Jack's perspective, not making the captor a
'movie villain' and choosing to deal with the fallout of the climax,
which occurs in the middle of the film. The result of these decisions
is one of the rawest emotional experiences of the year and further
proof that Lenny Abrahamson can do no wrong (Frank and What Richard
Did).

I have seen them all now. I saved "Room" for last because quite frankly
I was afraid of the subject matter. I almost did not watch it.I was afraid to see some sort of exploitation of the ordeals suffered
by the three Cleveland girls. Their stories touched me very personally,
as for so long when I would stop at the gas station or the 7-11 to buy
smokes (so long ago now) I would see their "missing" posters. And as
time went by, those 8x11 paper posters began to fray at the edges, to
become ripped at the tape holding them up, and then to disappear; just
like the girls on them. I do not recall noticing when the posters
disappeared... and that makes me feel guilty. Especially after they
were freed, and I remembered that I had forgotten them.So I put off "Room" for last. I didn't want to feel guilty all over
again. (No escaping Catholic upbringing.)I am pleased to report that after 10 minutes I felt no guilt watching
"Room". I am even more pleased to report that I felt many other
emotions: fear, revulsion, despair, hope, patience (is that an
emotion?), sympathy, and empathy. That last is surprising, since
nothing in my life could prepare me to empathize with a 5 year old boy
who only knows the inside of a back yard shed, then suddenly must deal
with the world. The real world. Most of all, I felt astonishment. At this late date it is hard for me
to imagine discovering the world. But it was so easy to share Jack's
astonishment. I felt like a five year old who knew nothing but the
inside of a small room then suddenly must deal with the world. I felt
what Jack was feeling. And for me, that makes it the best movie of the
year.A tender, thoughtful movie. The one that touched me, instead of just
entertaining me.My choice for Best Movie. I know it will not win. But what do the
voters know?

I knew I was wrong, but I avoided this movie for so long because I
couldn't help but think it was somehow associated with 2003's The Room.
A sequel, remake, reboot, whateverthat unintentionally hilarious,
albeit awful Tommy Wiseau film from 13 years ago still haunts me.And now, this 2015 film haunts me. Only, in a much different way.Other than my own dumb fears about the similar title, I knew almost
zero about it going in, and I would like to try and keep my review to
the bare minimum for anyone else who hasn't seen it. In fact, if you
have NOT seen it, and you absolutely MUST, stop now, bookmark this and
return. I won't spoil anything significant, but even knowing more than
me going in, or about 1%, is too much.Okay, you're back? Good. Here goes, to the best of my ability, my
effort to non-spoil this.Getting the synopsis out of the way might help explain my thoughts and
feeling following. Movie opens with a mother and her child in a small
room. Within minutes, or less, you realize that is their world. As
expected, more and more is revealed on how they came to live in such a
small room. And for how long. Too long. It also becomes apparent that
the boy knows of nothing else IN HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE but "Room." Or
the mysterious man that enters nightly, brings "presents" on Sundays
and is not allowed to see.Annnd, I'll stop there. There's so much more I want to say. Feelings,
emotions, fear, anger, hate, longing and ideas on how to solve the
problem. That last onethat's just me. I'm always trying to put myself
in the character's shoes and attempt to fix whatever problem, or
plainly, "what would I dobetter?" After some ideas, luckily, I
realized: I am NOT in her shoes. I never experienced what she went
through. I doubt 0.00000001% of the world's souls ever has. So, I'm
glad I could shut down the "obvious solutions" to this mother and son's
imprisonment. So, there you go. The movie's about a kidnapped mother and her son in a
tiny room. How would you cope? How would you care for your child when
all he knows is those four walls? How would you escapeif you ever
could? How would a five-year-old experience the real worldif he never
has before?This movie is harrowing, magnificent, brilliant, tough, original and
has some of the best acting I've seen in years. Of course, Brie
"Mother" Larson was fantastic. Never once did I not believe her, she
was as real as it gets. But, damn, that boy, (at the time of filming)
8-year-old Jacob Tremblay was incredible. I did love his mother's
performance, but multiply that by two for Tremblay. You can't help but
be captivated for what he has to go through, or learn about "the real
world" outside of Room.The other performances were solid  ALWAYS love me some Joan Allen  as
was the cinematography, score, directioneverything. I can barely think
of one thing I didn't like here. Okay, well, maybe one thingEven though I still grant this movie my highest honor: 10 out of 10
stars and it does nab my top pick of the eight Oscar nominated Best
Pictures of 2015 so far (still have yet to see Bridge of Spies and
Brooklyn,) my only complaint is that I wanted to know more. More of the
aftermath, and the details of what's outside Room.Guess I need to go buy the book this is based on. My one gripe, which really isn't a complaint, isn't enough to lessen
how incredible my experience was with this movie and how perfectly it
was shot and performed. You must see Room.Um, to clarify, don't see "The" Room. Just "Room."

Wow, this is such an incredible film.The acting is simply flawless and Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are
sensational in their roles. Lenny Abrahamson's direction is great, the
shots are excellent, the pace is spot on and the film's score is
rousing and beautiful. The film's story, which I really don't want to
spoil, is brilliant - it's so well thought through and so tight,
nothing falls through the cracks, no scenes or lines are unnecessary or
useless, the film has no wasted material.Emma Donoghue's screenplay is excellent; sad, uplifting, tragic and
wondrous, the film captures all of these feelings and emotions and
Donoghue's script aids this immensely.Please go out and see this film, it really deserves all the credit and
money it can get. One of the best, if not THE best, films of the year.

First things first, I do my absolute best not to ever write a "spoiler"
review. I'm going to honor that pledge with this review, but I have to
say that this is a hard movie to do justice to without spoiling it. But
I think I can, so read on.I decided to go see a random movie this afternoon after seeing the 2016
Oscar nominees were released. This movie is nominated for Best Picture,
and it was the one of the three nominees playing at the local
indie-flick theater in town that was about to start when I arrived at
the theater, so I chose to see it. The most important thing you can know about "Room" is that it's worth
seeing at least once. It's a pretty simple, low budget movie, so no
special effects or anything like that, so if you'd prefer to wait for
the digital release you can. Regardless of when you view it, though, my
suggestion is to try to go into this movie without knowing virtually
anything about it. Seeing it cold, without having read any reviews or
heard a thing about it, will greatly augment the experience.I say that because that's how I went about seeing this movie, and not
knowing what it was about really made it quite powerful for me. So
while it's fine to wait to see it at home, don't let anyone tell you
about it between now and when it hits digital release.Now, here's the one, tiny spoiler--nothing huge here, but just one
slight tidbit that I have to reveal in order to write much of a review
at all: This movie has a significant plot twist to it. That's all I'm
saying, but the point here is that in going into this movie cold and
not knowing a thing about it, I thought I was watching a certain story
play out on the screen, and then the plot twist hit........and WOW.
Man, oh man. I did NOT see that coming.That said, I'll finish here by saying a few words about the quality of
the film. The acting is great. The cinematography is great. And for a
low budget movie, it does what it sets out to do very effectively.The only thing that I might be slightly critical of is that as the plot
develops this movie gets a bit odd--not in the content of what the
story is about (although that is odd in and of itself), but rather that
after that plot twist happens it seems like everybody in the film
becomes a very irrational actor. For me, this made the film suffer a
bit, as I kept looking at the decisions that people made as the plot
moved on and I thought, "That's not very believable." And yet, the more
I think about it, the fact is that the irrational decisions and far
fetched mindset that so many of the characters have in this movie may
actually make it more believable, since people tend to be irrational
creatures.That having been said, I'd give the early portion of this film a 10,
and the rest of it a 7. It gets worse as it moves on, but at no point
does it ever become a bad movie. The other downside is that it's not a
film that would be very re-watchable--it's probably not one that you're
going to want own on Blu Ray so you can see it over and over again. But
it's definitely worth seeing once. All in all I'd call it an 8. So, 8/10 stars for me.

'Room' is an immensely powerful film. It has the ability to make its
audience care from minute one right until the dying seconds. There
isn't a weak scene any where in sight and the result is two hours of
magnificent cinema. It's rare that a film can succeed in so many
different aspects. The drama throughout is second to none, taking the
audience on an emotional roller coaster that is genuinely moving. There
is a scene of suspense that Hitchcock himself would be proud of. The
intensity in this scene would struggle to be matched by the absolute
best action directors Hollywood has to offer today. I haven't been that
on the edge of my seat in a long time. The script is also incredibly
thought-provoking. The character of 'Jack' played by Jacob Tremblay
delivers some truly beautiful voice-over work. If you truly listen to
what he's saying, in context, you can appreciate just how much we all
take for granted the small things in life. Behind everything else the
film has a wonderful message.Director Lenny Abrahamson, who has deservedly been nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Director for his work in 'Room', has done an
unbelievable job of balancing all these aspects of the film. He was
helped a lot too by his two leads giving near flawless performances.
Tremblay gives one of the best performances by a child-actor I can
remember in a long time. Sadly the category of Best Actor is simply too
strong for a child to be nominated in it this year, but make no
mistake, anyone who sees this will be blown away by his performance.
He's definitely one to be watched out for in the future. Brie Larson
has received a nomination in the Best Actress category and deservedly
so. The girl can act. She's been around a long time now but has really
found her niche in the last couple of years seemingly. Here, she
perfectly puts you in the shoes of the character and makes you feel
every emotion and every shred of desperation as realistically as if you
were actually in that situation. Based on what I've seen here, I'd call
her a shoo-in to win the Oscar.There's not a lot else to say about this work of perfection, other than
make sure you see it. The title could be considered a little bland and
I hope it doesn't put anyone off giving it a chance because the product
itself is anything but. Perfect direction, a beautifully written script
and superb performances, all equal one of the best films of the year. I
don't think it has quite enough momentum behind it to win the Best
Picture award in what is a very strong category this year, but the fact
it's been recognised with a nomination, and thus more people will get
to see it, is a bonus if nothing else. A flawless film.

I had just recently watched The Revenant in the movie theater and I
though that it was the best I had seen this year and by far during last
year as well, but I watched Room, and now I am thinking to myself - how
can everything be so perfect about the movie, perfect to the point
where tears are streaming down my face all because this film was too
special and too irresistible not to cry about it. This is a must watch
for anyone who loves movies, stories and splendid acting. Brie Larson
and Mr.Jacob - you guys were unbelievable, so natural, so emotional, I
fell in love with both of you and can never get you out of my heart,
you reached that very core and I can never take out your characters out
and I do not want to! This movie was something out of this world.
Nothing else I can say. SPEECHLESS.

Those that have not yet seen Room have not seen it because it is an
independent film. Indies are usually hard to come by and are often
expensive. Having seen that this was one of the highest rated films of
2015, I felt obliged to give it a watch. I was totally overwhelmed by
how much of a psychological impact it had on me. Sometimes,
psychological impacts are bad. Room is not one of them.Room focuses on two characters: Ma/Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack
(Jacob Tremblay). Very, very rarely are the two main characters of a
film as good as Larson and Tremblay. One of the few movies where the
main girl and the main guy are this good is Silence of the Lambs. Room
is at that level. After receiving her Golden Globe, Brie Larson is nominated for an
Academy Award for Best Actress--a role which she WILL win for. Larson
is one of those familiar faces seen in the backdrop of movies such as
Trainwreck, but Room finally exposes her acting ability and lets her
shine as she deserves.The one that really steals the show is young Jacob Tremblay. He is a
cute little Canadian kid who gives the performance of a lifetime. I was
actually rooting for the kid to win or at least be nominated for an
Oscar. Being nominated for an Oscar is a victory in itself. Say
Tremblay did win, imagine how angry other people would be if a
prepubescent beat them. When its good, its good. Tatum O'Neal was 10
when she won. Justin Henry was Tremblay's age when he was nominated for
Kramer vs Kramer. Room is a very depressing movie full of redemption that will make you
cry sadness one minute then tears of joy the next. When Brie Larson's
character was in her late teens, she helps a man find his dog.
Unbeknownst to her, she falls prey to a kidnapper and is placed in a
10x10 foot shed and kept there for almost 10 years. She has tried
multiple times to escape, but is never successful. She is raped and
eventually gives birth to a baby boy called Jack. Jack has never been
outside of the confinement and thinks that is all there is in the
world. Joy loves her son and shields him from the horrors of the
reality. Jack is a happy- go-lucky imaginative young man. A few days after Jack turns 5, Joy tells him the realities and
practices an escape plan. When Jack ventures out, he is completely
overwhelmed. When they both get out, the adjustments to life outside
seem almost impossible. Jack has never seen outside the Room and Joy's
reconciliation with her family after years in captivity seems almost
impossible. Room is based on a book based on a true story of a Austrian father who
kept his daughter locked in a basement dungeon for over 20 years. But
the movie touches base with so much more. The very idea of kidnapping
is depressing. But it also shows the importance of family. Joy and Jack
love each other more than anything, and we feel it. Joan Allen and
William H Macy play her parents, and we feel when they reunite. But
perhaps the most important thing Room shows is how precious life is and
how much there is in the world. Jack was a happy boy, living in a tiny
space. His journey outside is the biggest treat of his life. And of
course, the acting by all is superb.Room really hits home. It is one of the very best, emotionally-charged
movies I have ever beard witness to. One of the 100 best movies of my
life.

Adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel, this Fritzl-esque tale of
brutal long-term abuse may come across as the easier, Hollywoodised
alternative to Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but that description misses
the point. Room goes beyond the horror of physical incarceration and
explores arguably the more challenging issue of the psychological
incarceration that follows. It's easy for cinema to show suffering;
harder to portray recovery, especially the stuttering kind.Joy (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) are
imprisoned in a tiny room by an abuser known only as "Old Nick" (Sean
Bridgers). Jack hides in the closet when Old Nick visits Joy every
night. During the day, Joy teaches Jack about the world outside Room
(note the lack of definite article). There's wonderful humour and
pathos in her struggles to explain reality and fantasy via images on a
fuzzy old CRT TV. But for all her efforts, Joy comes to the conclusion
that she must help Jack escape and see the world for himself.I'll plant a minor spoiler alert here.We have a movie of two halves. The first half takes place entirely in
Room. The second follows the escape of Joy and Jack, and their efforts
to recover in the brightness and busyness of the wider world. There's
no trial for Old Nick. This is not a movie about the all-healing power
of justice. It's about a mother and son adjusting to long-term trauma,
and how it affects their relationships with the (grand)parents who've
been living in their own dreadful dark for the past seven years.It may be surprising to hear that this comes from Lenny Abrahamson, who
last brought us the relatively slight and irreverent Frank. While that
movie was distinguished by its irony, the earnestness in Room is almost
suffocating. It's not always subtle, proudly wearing its intention to
devastate, making it not so much a weepie as a complete and utter
bawlie, expertly tailored to tug the heartstrings. In some scenes this
can be a curse but overall it's a blessing. It's no small feat to
reduce an entire auditorium to a blubbering mess.As Joy's mother, shattered by her relief, Joan Allen almost steals the
show with an amazingly detailed performance. In the middle is Larson,
playing Joy as powerful and principled, carrying her hidden brokenness
out into the real world. But the movie belongs to Tremblay. Abrahamson
has drawn an astonishing performance from the youngster. For a start,
the kid really acts like a kid  it's not one of those creepily
precocious manchild performances that American cinema sometimes
conjures. Through Jack there's a sense of genuine wonder at the world,
whether it's within the confines of a sound-proofed shed, or outside
where the sky goes on forever. The youngest Best Actor in Oscar history
up to this point was almost 30. Just saying.I can't say I was on board with every filmmaking decision. Stephen
Rennicks' soaring, Johann Johannson-style music is frequently grating,
seeming to exist to make us the audience feel all fuzzy rather than
having any real relationship with the narrative. And there are certain
scenes which don't quite ring true. For example, the primetime TV
interview  an exercise in awkwardness  is unconvincingly thoughtless.
I mean, as if we need any more help sympathising with Joy. Perhaps US
TV journalism really is that insensitive, but it felt like low-hanging
fruit to me.There are no answers to the evil of Old Nick, nor for the suffering of
those he's abused. But uncertainty and doubt are not the same as
hopelessness. I felt manipulated  but that's what good movies do. In
its soul-scouring search for truth, inevitably the film dips into
sentimentality. But let's applaud Room for bringing to a broad audience
an extremely difficult subject and making it as accessible as it can
possibly be.

Jack is a spirited 5-year-old who is looked after by his mother, Ma,
who dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him
with warmth and love and doing typical things 5-year-olds like to do. Their life, however, is anything but. They are confined to a
windowless, 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has named Room. She has created
a whole universe for Jack, and will stop at nothing to ensure that,
even in their situation, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling
life. But as Jack's curiosity grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking
point, they enact a risky plan to escape, bringing them face-to-face
with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet, the world
outside.......Depending on who's point of view you see the film from, Room has two
different connotations. From the point of View of Ma, it begins as a
prison drama, her and Jack being held captive against their will, and
Ma being subject to abusive on an almost nightly basis. And then
there's the road to freedom, enlightenment, and finally, subjection and
coming to terms with the years that she lost, the most important years
of her life, and in turn, beginning to resent Jack for being the
creation of her imprisonment.From the View of Jack, it begins as normality to him, he and Ma are the
only people in the world, apart from the man who visits every night
while he is in his 'room', the wardrobe. His life here is the norm,
being born with a built in Helsinki Syndrome helps the falseness of his
world, and the love from his mother is unconditional, likens other
Mothers love.So when he finally leaves his world, he is subject to a whole new
world, an unsettling domain where he is made to wear a mask and
sunglasses as he will be vulnerable to a host of new germs. And no just that, new emotions are abound, such as Ma acting
differently, not the always there person he is used to, but someone who
is distant and weary.Plus the fact that there are a host of new people he meets, who react
differently, not forgetting the fact that they haven't seen Ma in an
age, relief turns to anger, turns to guilt, turns to neglect.It's a fascinating movie, heart breaking in one sense, and forfilling
at the same time, because not only can Jack start his new life, Ma has
to grieve her lost life, so an element of jealousy can be seen in some
scenes.Larson is wonderful as Ma, showing so many emotions in such a short
time, it won't be surprising is she wins every award this season.Tremblay is a major force in this film, putting in one of the best
child performance I've seen in while. Here's to a wonderful career
ahead.But the film belongs to Macy. There is one scene at the dinner table
that is so devastating, so sad, Grandpa denying his own Grandsons
existence, and uttering a syllable,Mis both should destroying and the
core of the film.Jack isn't to blame for anything, he was just created amongst the
chaos, he is the blessing, and to see a world full of hate form the
view of a five year old, especially when your free, you would long for
that one final visit to the room.An exceptional movie.

Overall, this is a beautiful film, driven by a brilliant story and
outstanding performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.Larson is hugely deserving of her Golden Globe win, and I hope to see
it replicated in the BAFTAs and Oscars. Conversely, Tremblay's lack of
Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations is mad, his performance was one of
the best parts of the movie! How does an 8-year-old even begin to
portray the role of a 5-year-old who has only ever lived in a tiny
room, while his mother is routinely abused by their captor, before
being expelled into a harsh and alien world? I saw a quote from a
review that said Tremblay's performance is "a revelation" and I
couldn't agree more!However, I was surprised to find that the author, Emma Donoghue had
also written the screenplay and yet changed so much from the original
text! I'm not naive that films can't be rigidly faithful as certain
things do not translate. For example, one of the most innovative
elements of the book is that it's told completely from Jack's point of
view, so work needed to be done to map that onto a film script, and
naturally some changes would have been needed.But why change things like names? Officer Oh became Officer Parker for
example. It's a trivial change, but having read the book only recently,
it jarred and seemed unnecessary.Then there were the larger changes that undermined some of the story's
power. Where Ma and Jack originally stayed in the hospital for what
felt like a much longer time (admittedly from Jack's perspective), and
greater care was taken not to expose Jack to the world before his
immune system was ready, the film seemed to accelerate his transition.
The passages in the hospital highlighted the desperate contradiction
between Ma's need to heal and Jack's need to always be near her, which
the film seemed to gloss over. Overall, the speed at which Ma and Jack
progressed from escaping Room, through a brief hospital stay, her
suicide attempt and their eventual adjustment to life Outside,
undermined the complex emotional and physical struggle for both
characters that Donoghue describes in the book.All that said, it was still an excellent film. Horrifying subject
matter, told in a way that was moving and funny without being trite or
disrespectful. If I hadn't read the book, I would probably have rated
it a 9. Ardent lovers of the original book might find themselves a little
disappointed in places, but I'd recommend it to all.

This is a very brutal film, but it has to be expected from the fact
that it is about abduction. It feels very menacing the whole way
through, as things aren't all sunshine and rainbows on the outside.
There is very little musical score to the film, which I think makes the
film feel even more empty and desolate. The child actor Jacob Tremblay,
who plays Jack, is very good in this, one of the best child actors I
have ever seen. And yes, the child is a boy and is played by a boy,
despite how he looks for the majority of the film, which some
film-goers around me at the cinema were shocked to find out. There are
parts of the film in which I was left asking what happened to some of
the characters, but it was a pretty good film nonetheless.

This film was absolutely amazing! Best film I have ever seen, it was so
breathtaking and memorizing. The story line was incredibly wrote and
all of the actors were just outstanding. Could easily watch this film
everyday for the rest of my life and never get sick of it. It was
incredible! Everything about it was so imaginative it almost seemed real.It plots
you straight into the story and straight away makes you plead with
sympathy for Jack and Ma. Would absolutely love the thought of a second
one of this film. Easily impressed. I recommend it to anyone and
everyone. Definitely a 10/10 in my opinion.

After reading all the comments I just had to see this movie. I expected
it would be about the difference in feelings between mother and child
about their situation (In the Room as well as outside). And in a way it
was, especially the first half of the film, which was really good. The
second half disappointed me a little bit. It even was a bit boring and
sometimes over the top sentimental. Where the movie made me cry in the
first half, the second half made me laugh. Because it was funny to see
how over the top wise Jack was. And everything was done to make the
viewer feel something. However sometimes less is more. Over the top is
funny. But the American audience will love it.

It came to me as a big surprise. I love when I don't have any
expectations about a movie and it turns out to be a jewel.Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are very impressive. The first has
proved in this movie that she could fill a dramatic role, although I
also love her in her comedy roles. Jacob was a discovery for me, but
he's very authentic. I am sure he will has a successful career before
him.I just resent the fact that Ma's character did not get developed
thoroughly. There are a couple of lose ends there, and his discomfort
with the whole story is not really explained properly.It's worth for the story, and for the acting. But as you can guess,
it's not an easy topic.

This movie blew me away. I'm too used to the usual tripe version: too
much dwelling on the sick nature of what happened in gory details to
shock the viewer rather than focusing on the characters, and usually
the movie ends the second they escape, off to an instant happy ending.
This movie is refreshingly different and focuses on the personal
experiences of the boy in particular and his mother, with almost half
the movie dedicated to what happens after the escape. Because of this
it's very effective at making you feel for the characters and connect
with each rise and fall. Not an instant happy ever after that people
swaddle themselves with, but a true raw connection with the human
difficulties and consequences of a horrible ordeal. It's celebrating
how people adapt and dust themselves off that is inspiring, not a
whitewashed instant gratification. Well worth the watch, best movie
I've seen in some time.

If there is one life changer of a movie, "Room" is one must witness on
the nearest screen possible to experience a heart-stirring tale of
mother and son. Though as simple as the premise is of a mother and son
taken captivity, what makes "Room" stand out is how it can take the gut
right out of every emotion to convey the complexities of the source
material by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) with the the
help of Lenny Abrahamson's subtle direction. Brie Larson is at her best
ever, since "Short Term 12", playing the scorned Ma, having to make
ultimate sacrifices for her son Jack, played by the excellent Jacob
Tremblay. It is their performances what made "Room" hit all the
heartfelt notes in an unforgettable way. Every individual and duel
moment from them will take your breath away. From the claustrophobic
scenes in "room" to the breathtaking touches of "space", the experience
is one of a kind.

Very powerful. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give tremendous
performances as a young mother her five-year-old son who live in the
eponymous room. As their story unfolds, the film begins to tighten its
grip, so it's a pity that around this time in the story there are a
couple of not very believable aspects to the plot. Never mind: once
they're out of the way, the final section of what is essentially a
three-act drama raises the emotional temperature further. I confess I
was a tear-stained rag at the end.The presence of Joan Allen and William H. Macy in supporting roles is a
testament to the quality of a project they clearly felt they wanted to
be part of. Sean Bridgers, Tom McCamus and Amanda Brugel also make
noteworthy contributions.On the basis of this, and of that excellent, eccentric movie FRANK,
it's easy to see that Lenny Abrahamson is a superb director of actors,
with an interest in and an understanding of the complexity of people's
relationships.

There are only a handful of films that I can think about during a
regular day that get me lost back into the theater to re-experience the
beauty and magic of those films. "Room" is one of them. This is a film
that can transform your emotions so quickly and so authentically that
you forget your watching a film. "Room" controls you and manipulates
your feelings to a level that no film has done before. We enter the
film in a tiny room, which is actually a shed in a man's backyard that
Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) have been held
captive for seven years. Joy is repeatedly assaulted by the man (which
is how Jack was conceived) and is trapped in a nightmare. The two make
the best of their situation, and once they escape, try and see the
world for the beautiful and larger room that it truly is. Let's start
by saying that Brie Larson gives perhaps the greatest performance by an
actor in cinematic history. Her emotions and realistic approach to her
character are so full of detail and has the ability to put you to tears
due to her character's tragic situation and her remarkable comeback.
This is the best actress alive today. Jack Tremblay also makes a
startling revelation as one of the world's most talented young actors.
"Room" is a beautiful film with spectacular direction by Lenny
Abrahmson, who shifts from beautiful scenes between a mother and son,
to a heart-pounding escape, and finally to the powerful and beautiful
struggles and joys that life has to offer. "Room" will alter your
feelings greatly throughout, but will leave you speechless due to the
breathtakingly beautiful writing by Emma Donoughe and the glorious
implications of hope and beauty in the world.

I had picked Brie Larson as the favorite to win the best actress this
year and she might juts pull it off though this movie has an
anticlimactic ending that doesn't explore the full extent of the
horrible events depicted. Room is based off a book by the same name
written by Emma Donoghue. The novel won all sorts of awards and
shortlisted for many others. I have not had the privilege to read it
but I've heard good things. Donoghue also adapted the screenplay. The significance of this movie cannot be denied as I clearly remember
hearing the horrifying tale of the three women in Cleveland and the
other awful experiences of young woman at the hands of derange men.
This movie takes place in Ohio too. Overall this movie is very sad and moving, a real downer. Jack played
by Jacob Tremblay steals the show. I'm surprised he didn't get
nominated for a Golden Globe. His young performance was only outdone by
the young man of Beasts of No Nation, Abraham Attah. This doesn't take
away from Tremblay's performance. He dominates the film and his
voice-over brings us into the strange world of room. The back and forth
between him and Larson's Joy, or Ma, was real and grew steadily
nerve-wrecking as they plan their escape.See the rest of this review and more at swilliky.com

The title is "Room" not "The Room." The more general term makes the
film about the space in our lives and in our selves and our need to
escape whatever walls or restrictions that others  or we ourselves 
have imposed on us. So our experience really is reflected in this
freakish story. The film is about the vast room we have at our disposal
not the small room to which we might accept restriction. Unlike most of us, this boy's first five years are spent in a small
enclosed shed with no other outside experience but a usually blank
skylight sky and the confusion of realities on the wavering TV. No
cable there, no proper connection. His Ma has nurtured his delusion
that there is no real world out there, concealing their imprisonment
until he is old enough to handle it  i.e., to escape. When they do get
out she's troubled by his slowness to make a "connection" to anything,
but he does, first (of course) to Lego, which enables him to start
building his own world, then to a neighbour pal. Unlike most of us, Ma, nee the lost Joy, had her high school joy and
promise smashed by seven years of sexual enslavement. But as she was
the anchor on her school relay team she's the anchor in her Jack's
life. And he becomes her reason to survive. Their (non-umbilical) cord
isn't broken until well into their liberation. Only then does she stop
breast-feeding him. The film ends with Jack and Ma going back to Room to say goodbye. Of
course the past is not the same: the evidence has been removed but
mainly, it's not Room any more with the door removed. Its essence was
restriction not space. The two leave restriction behind to embrace the
expanse of freedom. But psychological restriction remains. Ma's suicide attempt and the TV
interviewer's insensitive probing show her still scarred. Jack seems
stable when he pulls out of his Ma's embrace to go play with his
new/first friend Aaron. This story is a bleak parody of Eden as a
parable of our origin. Their captor "Old Nick" evokes Satan. Joy's two "families" curiously contrast. Her relationship with her
captor is a bleak parody of marriage. Jobless, Old Nick is a loser who
asserts his false authority by enslaving and abusing Joy. Imprisoning
Joy gives him a power and potency he lacks in real life. Enough
families, alas, live like that without the literal abduction. Joy's one firm rule is to insist Old Nick will never touch or even see
little Jack. She enforces that principle to the point of hysteria. She
will save Jack from her contamination by Old Nick, later even denying
his paternity. Once reunited, Joy's father can't bring himself even to
look at Jack. For him, the boy embodies his daughter's and therefore
his shame. The boy's father's imposed restriction parallels the
grandfather's self-imposed containment.In contrast, Joy's mother Nancy's new man embraces him in a sensitive,
respectful manner. Jack opens up to him: "I had a dog once but he
wasn't real." Luckily, Leo brings him a real dog, Shamus, a cozier
creature than the big black lab who's Jack's first contact in the
outside world. As Nancy admits, Joy's was not the only life destroyed by her
abduction. Obviously the parents' marriage was another casualty. The
father moved away and remains remote. But Nancy immediately accepts
Jack. Her first words to him are thanks for saving "our little girl."
Jack saves her again by sending her his "strong" in the hair he lets
Nancy cut off and bring her. In a touching irony, Joy's horrific
enslavement has not diminished her adolescent tensions with her mother.
Bonding is like that, as restricting and yet as liberating as  the
room through which we live.

The first 45 min are not bad. It gives idea of the claustrophobic
situation and the desperation of it, although very little. After the
escape (hello! No spoiler, it's in the description the movie) out
becomes unbalanced and drags on as a drama. Nothing about the
investigation. Just to many scenes of getting back into the real life.
The narration a boy who is far too old to be a 5 year old is about as
irritating out gets but I get this with American child across a lot.
The story is rather flat, in dialogue, in relationships, in storyline.
I know it happens to people like kampusch but that just isn't enough to
compensate for poor directingand flat writing. Not impressed.

I saw this film as part of the LFF and can't recommend it enough. Even
though the subject matter is dark, the film is truly uplifting. I would recommend even for fans of the book as in my eyes this offered
much more. It doesn't have the sense of time you get from the book nor
perhaps Ma's desperation but I thought it dealt with the matter
beautifully. It wasn't sensational at all where it could have been. The acting is fantastic, Brie Larson was excellent and I thought she
would be good when I heard she was cast as she impressed in short term
12. No disappointments there. The boy, Jack, was just brilliant, I see so many films where the child
actors overact and are over cutesy. He did neither, he was perfect. He
really broke my heart with the smallest expressions and quiet words.I would like to see them both nominated for Oscars and this is without
doubt one of my films of the year. Enjoyed this much more than the book. Go see it. It's fantastic. Bring
a tissue!

This is the movie that happens every year that isn't good, but wins
critical acclaim by being distinct and including a child actor. It's
disturbing, but without the tact required by the writing.Now to spoil things. A woman is held hostage as a sex slave for seven
years and at some point has a baby boy, who she convinces the "Room" is
the entire world. During this they play uplifting music and it is
absolutely tonally daft. Once they escape Room they are better off.
Then, "Ma" feels bad about how horribly she treated her son and thus
tries to kill herself, to make it all better.Also, the boy in this movie looks and sounds exactly like a girl and
has long hair. So I'm expecting maybe "Ma" lied that it was a boy, so
her kid wouldn't be a rape target. Nope. Toward the end you realize
it's a boy, and you go, "Whoa, why was I distracted by that for
absolutely no reason?"Then, they revisit Room. And Ma feels better. Because going to where
you were repeated raped for seven years makes you happy. Absurd,
ridiculous, fantastical film that is unintentionally insulting.

Kidnapped at fourteen and locked up in a room for seven years with a
five year old child conceived through violence, director Lenny
Abrahamson's film inspired by Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name -
a composite of true events - is titled ROOM; a delicate and harrowing
story of two people caught in a private space, where they live a life
of extreme tenderness and tension. The actors are excellent, Brie
Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack create a
home/neighborhood/community/country inside a small, cluttered "room"
with occasional shafts of light beaming down from a skylight that
displays the stars and moving clouds - the outside "world" a dream
beyond their reach.A television sputtering on the blink allows that other "world" entry,
but for young Jack, what he sees flickering on the screen is both real
and "make believe" ; distinctions have been erased and are unknowable.
The relationship between mother and child is stunning - the connection
between them is acutely poignant, as if the umbilical cord had never
been severed. Days are spent exercising, running back and forth- sharp
turns are necessary after a few steps, making us aware of the
claustrophobic feel of the space; and Ma's attempt to teach her son to
read and maintain a somewhat "normal" existence is impressive and
heart-rending. Jack's poetic and descriptive use of words to describe
his circumscribed environment invokes the originality and charm of
expressing and interpreting what we see and feel through language
tailored to one's unique cosmos. We also witness the chilling visits of
"Old Nick" her captor whose step on the stairs on his way to the "room"
is a sign for little Jack to hide and feign sleep behind a shuttered
closet door - the presence of "evil" glimpsed through cracks in the
battered and weatherworn slats.When Jack turns five his mother decides he is old enough to participate
in an escape plan involving resilience and courage which eventually
succeeds. Mother and child are hospitalized and the second half of ROOM
begins. How to acclimate one's self to being separate individuals,
after the powerful link between them is sundered - a tie which was both
nourishing and restrictive? Accommodation to "freedom" begins, and the
aching awareness of the familiar becoming unfamiliar, as well as the
unfamiliar becoming familiar, are daunting and formidable.ROOM is an exquisitely fragile story of the pliancy of the human
resolve to survive and adapt to suffocating circumstances and adjust to
the shock of change after flight and rescue. A child's ability to
embrace the magic of his new environs - as one Dr. mentioned in
examining Jack, "he is still plastic"; and an adult's more complex road
to acclimatization which includes grieving the loss of a singular bond
where the "other" completes you to the exclusion of everyone else.

Room (2015): Dir: Lenny Abrahamson / Cast: Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay,
Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen, Tom McCamus: A room can seem gigantic to a
boy whose only glimpse of the outside world are that of a television.
He is Jack and this room is his world along with his mother Joy. She
raises him within that room heightening his imagination with various
activities until bedtime in a closet. Nights are chilling because that
is when Old Nick returns. He keeps them locked in this room and abuses
Joy who protects Jack. When all seems lost Joy schemes a plan for
Jack's freedom and the result is a spectacular yet intimidating image
of adapting to a bigger universe. Director Lenny Abrahamson does an
intriguing and detailed job at showcasing this outside freedom from
both perspectives and how both Jack and Joy adapt differently. Brie
Larson has become one of the most dependable talents with a resume of
diverse roles. This is Larson at her best as she struggles to raise her
son within confinement and then prepare him for an escape into an
unseen world. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick whose footage is brief but
important as his sadistic choices become clear. Joan Allen plays Joy's
mother who eventually introduces Jack to his very first hair cut. Tom
McCamus plays her second husband, Leo who accepts Jack when his
grandfather cannot muster up the ability to look at him. This is a
powerful and emotionally charged film about motherhood at its most
extreme. It demonstrates what a mother will go through to allow her son
a promising future and an escape from the enclosed space that was room.
Score: 10 / 10

Wow that is what comes to mind when I think of Room and especially when
I think of Jacob Tremblay's performance. Room has one of, if not, the
best child acting performances of all time.No doubt Director Lenny Abrahamson worked his ass off to make this
possible along with the rest of the cast and crew which also do a
tremendous job to make this film come to life.One thing that I think makes this film so great is it's screenplay. It
is written by someone who knows the source material more than anyone,
the books author Emma Donoghue. I loved how events in Jack's life where
told by his extremely imaginative and optimistic point of view even if
deep down what he is describing is extremely dark and traumatic. The
whole film opts for a hopeful, feel good tone which I appreciated as it
easily could have been much darker.Since I saw her in the indie flick Short Term 12 I remember saying that
one day Brie Larson would win an Oscar. I may be right as she
beautifully portrays a loving mother who is strong when she needs to be
for her son. It's a fantastic performance with a believable on screen
bond between the two leads. Although Brie Larson being Oscar worthy,
Jacob Tremblay's mesmerising lead role in the film outshone her by far,
but this may be due to personal expectations.Go see Room, it is an extremely well made film from it's wonderfully
unique screenplay (and dialogue), it's astonishing child and adult
acting and of course it's directing that has successfully brought
everything together as we cut the cord and say "Hello Jack!"

There's a common saying that goldfish grow to the size of their bowls.
This, in turn, is used to describe the limits or extent of a person's
world view, often implying one of two things  either that you can have
a very narrow and limited view of your environment if you allow it to
be that way, or alternatively, that by pulling off someone's blinkers,
you can set their mind free into all kinds of untold possibilities. Room explores, brilliantly, both of these extremes in a way which is
touching, tender, emotional, yet also has tension, precision and power.
The first section is claustrophobic in the extreme in some respects,
the goldfish clearly trying to be kept restricted and contained. Four
bleak walls and one distant skylight form the landscape, with tattered
crayoned pictures and grubby misshapen items offering little relief. Yet the creativity and determination of Joy towards her young son Jack
lights up much of this segment. At least initially. Things very quickly
take a more sinister turn as we're introduced to old Nick, their
captor, who is initially a shadowy and ill-formed figure, viewed from
the wardrobe.As plans are fomented to deal with the situation at hand, the action
and acting, accompanied by the music, interplay in quite magnificent
ways to ratchet up the dramatic tension. Even then, little moments of
tender humanity and humour are allowed to show their faces, making this
feel like your peering into their tiny bowl. And when finally the break
for freedom happens, you're left almost unable to breathe with fear and
hope, as the brave new world swings tantalisingly into view.The second section, unsurprisingly, takes more than a few blinking
moments to come into view. Suddenly the bowl is huge and scary and
although we're allowed to breathe again, it's in a short shallow
slightly shaky way. We meet more people who we're given to understand
in an understated way have also been finding things difficult to cope
with. This is in many ways at the crux of what we see unfolding,
although there's also a beautifully played subplot about growing up and
letting go.There was one what I felt was a slightly clunky moment during a TV
interview, but with hindsight, I can see this was a plot device used to
take you deeper into the mindset of Joy, helping to explain subsequent
events. The juxtaposition happening before you is unsettling at the
same time as it's uplifting and yet the director manages to tie things
up and bring closure to the production in a beautiful way. Although
certainly elements are harrowing, it is never mawkish or gloom-ridden
and it strikes a particular balance between dark and light throughout. The score, edits and photography are superb, really adding to the piece
overall, with the music in particular hitting the sweet spot. I've
spent most of the past 24 hours with things from this movie bubbling
around in my mind, in particular, picking over details of what we've
seen as well as wondering about what happened next (I know I know, it's
fiction but that's how engaging and embracing I found this). One of Jack's little soliloquies towards the end in particular had a
resonance that went far wider than the contained events we were
presented with  he's outside the bowl looking in now methinks. 5

Holy SH#%"! I had to write my first review after watching this movie!This is the most horrible claustrophobic story portrayed in a most
amazingly calm and beautiful way. I saw this movie without knowing what
I went in to, and was amazed and torn up at the same time.The story unfolds perfectly and every detail was explained to just the
right amount, making it horrifyingly realistic and plausible.A movie has never lingered in my head for so many days after watching
it, almost adopting the eerie claustrophobic powerlessness of the
situation. I just want to do anything else than stay in my
room/apartment!Watch it and weep - like I did...

Emma Donoghue adapts her own successful novel for the big screen in
this Oscar-nominated drama that could be based on real events. Room
begins in a tiny room, a converted shed in the back garden of an
abductor. Brie Larson (this is surely a breakout role for the
supporting actor from comedies such as 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim
vs The World) plays Joy, the woman who has been trapped there for 7
years, and this is all her five-year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) has
ever known. His conception of the world is limited to "Skylight" and
"Wardrobe", with the place outside the room merely outer space. I don't
want to say much more - don't watch the trailer! - as you should
really, definitely, see this film. Room, at different times over the course of its runtime, sets different
tones. The beginning is harsh, uncomfortable and harrowing. The
claustrophobic direction, with Danny Cohen's expert cinematography,
honestly makes you feel like there is nothing outside of this Room. The
entire lives of our two central characters are on display, with
literally nowhere to hide, and the nasty, desolate situation is equal
parts hard to watch and finely crafted. From this desperate, harrowing
scenario comes suspense, with a tense, breathless atmosphere concocted
with almost no action. However, what I perceived as the prevailing tone
of the film (chiefly due to my optimistic nature) was the beauty and
wonderment of the piece. Somewhat like Inside Out, the only way to
describe Room is simply beautiful. The relationship between mother and
son is rarely so sublimely depicted. Even through all the pain and
suffering that they go through, director Lenny Abrahmason conveys the
love wonderfully, helped by skilled, natural performances. Whilst some
scenes are sad enough to bring a tear to the eye, I found myself closer
to crying in some of the less depressing scenes - embraces, reunions,
etc., which is helped by a score that seems jarringly loud due to the
still quiet of most of the rest of the film. When the music kicks in,
you know it's a special moment. The convincing nature of the piece is
supported by two giants of performances in the form of the astonishing
Tremblay, who hopefully has a bright future ahead of him, and the
rightly-award-tipped Larson. Tremblay helps steer Room from the
pitfalls of a precocious, irritating child actor with a natural and
believable role, conveying wonderment and joy at the situation that we,
and his mother, know as horribly bleak. His tantrums are like watching
a real child in motion, and he comes out as the lead actor - a tough
feat, but successfully achieved. Meanwhile, as Joy, Larson bears all
the sadness and anger that is the inverse of her innocent and wide-
eyed son. The supporting performances, especially from Joan Allen as
Joy's mother, and William H. Macy as her father, are equally brilliant. I struggled to think of anything wrong with Room. And it's true; very
little keeps it from being a perfect 10. And having waited a couple of
days, I have still not come to any realisation of negativity. I suppose
all I can say is that it is not incredibly memorable - I may not watch
this film much in the future, and it's tough to watch. However, Room
holds up as one of the very greatest films of 2015. 95/100.

This wonderful film might easily be over looked with the likes of Star
Wars, Hateful 8, The Revenant and Creed taking up most of the headlines
but this is such a wonderful film, don't let it slip away without
giving it a watch.Initially set in one small room where a Mother (Bree Larson) and her 5
year old son (a spellbinding performance by Jacob Tremblay) are held
hostage. From the first shot you're instantly struck by the superb
cinematography and the way one room can be portrayed. The simple and
beautifully easy way of life for the 5 year old boy is fascinating to
watch and draws you into their world with ease.It's a long, slow film but doesn't feel like it in either case. Full of
emotional, nail biting scenes it's a brilliant roller-coaster of
emotions; you can't beat the odd tear of happiness when watching a
film.Bree Larson is up for Best Actress at the Oscars for this role and it's
easy to see why, some wonderful acting on her part and indeed the
entire (quite small) cast. This is a delightful film and I'd absolutely
recommend taking the time to see this one.

The premise, a mid thirties woman held captive in a single roomed
windowless garden shed for seven years, molested by her captor
resulting in a pregnancy, and the resultant son living his entire five
years of life in the shed, is not encouraging. But Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack have to be seen to be
believed. They are so good you forget they are actors. The other roles
are competently supporting, and serve to focus one's attention on Ma
and Jack. The storyline unfolds with unpredictable twists and turns,
but the emotion it finds in virtually everyone who has seen this film
I've spoken to make it one of the best cinema experiences of the year.

I really had no idea what this movie was about when I was going see it
and it was truly an amazing story! Brie Larson fully deserves all the
wonderful recognition she is getting. She delivers such a heart-
wrenching, powerful performance in "Room." Such a sad and emotional
story, Larson connects so well with the emotions of a person in such a
terrible scenario allowing the audience to go there with her. With the
help of her small but incredibly talented co-star, Jacob Tremblay,
Larson gives the performance of a life time. The relationship between
the two of mother and son was one of my favorite aspects of this film.
I also appreciated that they gave the audience an inside look at the
aftermath once the victims finally were blessed to escape from
captivity. I was blown away to see what life had brought for Carol and
George, now 17 years old! Director Lenny Abrahamson creates such a big
story in a small space. Between the directing and the music, there is
no way you don't shed a tear at least once during this film. Tears and
all, this film is worth the watch. It has taken award season by storm
and I'm glad this film is receiving the recognition it deserves.

There are many levels to what makes a great movie. You can talk about
the technical aspects, the pacing and the writing all day long and know
that it's great. But what makes an incredible movie? For me, it's the
emotional value.I watched Room towards the end of 2015 before I saw any of the
frontrunning best picture nominations and to be honest, it was the most
memorable. The writing had me invested in the story, the acting had me
invested in the characters and the film making was incredibly unique
giving me even more of an appreciation for the movie. As I said though,
what had me hooked the most was the fact that the content of the film
was hitting me on an emotional level. Whilst following their own
personal arcs, I was experiencing the same emotions and understanding
where they were coming from. That's intelligent movie making.I can only say good things about this film. The only reason I didn't
give it a ten is because I'm a sucker for sweeping environment style
cinematography that obviously didn't have relevance in this kind of
film, however, upon a rematch I may be inclined to change this and give
this movie a rating of ten.

When I first heard the tiny voices of a five year old child describing
how he/she (Sex wasn't specified at the time) has made a connection to
every object in a shabby "Room", I opined in my mind that maybe it was
a cheap ploy to draw out pity from the unsuspecting audience, who were
totally unaware what they were in for. But without enough information
on the context in which the child's words were conjured up, blended
with the fact that the film was within a time frame of 5 minutes, I
resolved to continue. And for the remaining 90 minutes I was left
astounded because I had never seen a film that is so "tortuous" and
"touching" at the same time-each "T's" given their own half and ground
work to manifest, shine and totally connect with the audience in
ripples.It all starts in a room-claustrophobic it is: a room that serves as a
"world" to 5 year old jack and his Ma/Mum (played by Brie Larson).
Immediately, it becomes visible to the audience that the duo are
inhabiting in a poverty stricken situation, especially when you hear ma
telling 5 year old Jack that the vitamin he is currently taking is his
last or even when she tries to kill a rat, which is normal but with a
discomfited explanation: telling jack that "It might steal our food".
Enough bases are laid to show how deprived they are living with little
exposition for their living conditions. Lo and behold, while concerned
with their state of affairs, there is a high tendency to forget that
all this takes place in just a "Room". No movement is shown on how they
move into other quarters, which sort of leaves the viewer in a state of
guesses. Is Ma a prostitute- considering that she locks Jack in the
closet when a male visitor comes around? Or Ma might be living on
government support while trying to maintain her crack addiction
(far-fetched though). My guess was the first question and the most
logical for anyone to conjecture. But it also goes to show how the
hush-hush of the plot forces one to reason otherwise. A water closet without a lid, virtually no windows except the small
glass sun-light entry at the roof with a lavatory, bed and a
bathtub-all in one small space-a "Room"! The most intense moments in
the film come with how Jack views his environs. It is his world. He was
born in it-very in touch with the virtually non-existent happenings
that take place. Things like cars, trees, the sky and even other humans
are all abstract. At first sight, I thought Jack was a girl because of
the long hair, but given the circumstances, one would understand why
that came to be. I remember that scene where Ma tells him that there is
a whole other world out there and not a planet like she had previously
told him-his feedback was with disgust-vocally and vehemently hostile
to Ma's words. Even when he goes out of "Room"-the yearning to go back
guides his every being, how he reacts to every touch and fails to
connect. Jack is played by Jacob Tremplay in one of the most pitiful as
well as endearing performance from a child taken from his small
confines and thrust into the world-finding it hard to fine-tune into
the larger- than-"Room" earth. But his recovery is visually
soothing-done in a step by step manner though with a little touch of
let's-do-it-for- convenience-sake.It was a kidnap by a middle aged man that put Ma and Jack in the
"Room". Only he knows the code to the room. He kidnapped Ma when she
was 17, raped her and Jack was the product. Ma waited until Jack was 5
before she used him to find freedom. The scenes leading up to their
escape no matter how valiant swings back and forth between borderline
irresponsibility of a mother and last minute attempts at
freedom-literally. Unfortunately for Ma, it takes Jack a little while
to understand why Ma rolls him up in a rug or why she places a hot rag
on his head so he can pretend sick. And in the process convince the
captor to take him outside-a means by which Jack escapes. Brie Larson
has played a mother before. See the film (Train wreck), in which she
played Amy's sister: 2015's best romantic comedy yet! That
protector/guardian/Mother role is a comfort zone for her; she plays it
as if it is a second skin. But here, her work is laden with a puddle of
grief and she lives up to the billing wedged between a downcast figure
who reserves strength and optimism and a woman who struggles in the
aftermath. The scenes after her character is rescued shows how much she
is in touch with her sorrowful side, which is aided by the poignant
feel of the film's score. "Room" is a harrowing experience. 2015's best-----yet! From my own
perspective, this is the film to beat. Last year (2014), it was the
dark, brooding, righteously-themed business drama: A Most Violent Year,
but this year (2015) presents a melancholic-esque claustrophobe:
"Room". It's usually small scale, little budget, independent,
non-franchise films like this that makes the most sense-telling a story
that reaches out to the heart and apprehension of its audience. I would
bear false witness if I said it wasn't distressing-it is! The
perturbing narrative claws at the gorge of human consciousness, and
replicates itself there like a cell undergoing meiosis-it spreads and
plants, adhering, which leaves the viewer to imagine him/herself in the
same gloomy hopeless picture of a woman who has lived in a particular
room for 7 years-no sun, no air, no human contact. This is the kind of
film that will uplift the mood of prisoners after seeing it-who will in
turn thank their stars for their plight-at least they get to feel the
sunlight and interact with humans.

"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know
everything!"It doesn't feel right to call Lenny Abrahamson's latest film a small
one because it is such a rewarding and emotional experience. Yes, it is
a low key and small scaled film, but it has such a profound impact on
the audience that it is far from being small. The first half of the
film takes place in a very confined space, which makes the second half
of the movie even more rewarding as the world around these two
protagonists expands. Very few times in film has a director captured
such an interesting and authentic mother and son dynamic as we find
here with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances. Larson is
guaranteed to win the Oscar for her lead role here and she fully
deserves it as this mother who has endured the worst of times, but
found a means of surviving through her son. She truly lives a
nightmare, but Abrahamson doesn't focus on that as much as he does at
making us experience their world through the young son's eyes. He is
innocent and has never seen the world outside of the small room in
which he unknowingly has been held captive since his birth. His mother
has done everything she can to give him a happy and normal life despite
the situation. Tremblay delivers an equally impressive performance, and
his young age shouldn't have been a factor when it came to voting for
the best performances of the year. He was outstanding and held his own
in each scene he shared with Larson. The two performances are the main
reason why Room has achieved such greatness. Room is based on Emma Donoghue's best selling novel about a 5 year old
boy who experiences the world in the confined space of a small room.
The only person he has direct contact with is his mother. His only
contact with the outside world is through a small TV, but his mother
has told him that the images are of other universes far from theirs.
Jack also knows there is one other person that exists in their world,
as some nights a visitor comes into the room from a locked door, but
his mom orders him to keep away from him and stay in his wardrobe.
Jack's mother has done her best to give him love and nurture, but as
his curiosity begins to grow there is only so far she can go with her
story. What will happen when young Jack realizes that there is actually
more to the world than the small room in which they have been confined
in? What follows is a deeply emotional and profound thriller that shook
me to my core. Lenny Abrahamson is known for delivering original and unconventional
stories. Previously to Room he had directed Michael Fassbender in
Frank, a film in which the main protagonist wore a giant paper-mache
mask throughout the story. Room however goes a step further delivering
a thriller in a very unconventional way as we get to experience the
harrowing events through the innocence of a five year old boy and the
depths his mother goes through to give him a normal life. From the very
opening scene we know there is nothing normal about their lifestyle,
but at the same time the film avoids the typical atmosphere we are used
to seeing in crime related films. I don't want to say too much about
Room because the less you know about it the better, but the second half
delivers even more thrills and engages the audience with even more to
ponder about. Finding freedom is only have of the battle, and most of
the time these films fail to focus on it, but Room manages to deliver
on both ends. This is an effective and powerful film and I'm finding it
incredibly hard to put into words how much it affected me.

This is a drama that holds from its two protagonist. Brie Larson is
amazing and very much deserving of the Oscar this year, and Jacob
Tremblay's performance as her son Jack, is stunning. Despite its grim
subject matter about the complexity of the relationship between a
mother and her child that being kept captive, "Room" never wallows in
darkness, but instead stares defiantly into the light and the hope. It
is an emotionally powerful story and an honest film that is great
through its simplicity. The script from Emma Donoghue is truly
spectacular. Never again a fictional story could feel so much like a
true story...

Room tells the story of a 5 year old boy named, Jack(Jacob Tremblay) &
his Ma(Brie Larson). Ma was abducted by Old Nick(Sean Bridgers), when
she was 17 years old. Her son Jack & her have been held captive in a
tiny room for a couple of years. For little Jack, that room is his
whole world. He has lived there, all his life. Ma tells Jack that,
"Room" as they call it, is all there is in the world. Anything outside
the room, is space & aliens. She tells him this fantasy tale, to hide
the truth about Old Nick. Somehow, Jack & Ma get the opportunity to
escape & miraculously, they do. Now, Jack has to face the real world in
its entirety. Ma has to cope with the world after a long gap & help
Jack get accustomed to his new life. Room is a flawless & mind blowing film! It is a one of a kind
experience. Director Lenny Abrahamson has masterfully adapted Emma
Donoghue's novel of the same name. One of the highlights of this movie
is that, everything is shown & explained to the viewer, from Jack's
perspective. From the camera angles, to the adorable narration, we see
the events of the film unfold through Jack's eyes. Apart from being an
emotional & feel-good drama, Room also has a few thrilling moments.
These will have you on the edge of your seat. At its core though, this
movie is about the infinite love that a mother & her child share. The
performances are the main highlight of the film. Brie Larson has given
the best performance of her career, as Ma. Larson has proved her
versatility by acting in a variety of movies, ranging from adult
comedies like 21 Jump Street(2012), to indie dramas like Room. Brie
Larson truly deserves all the appreciation & accolades coming her way.
Jacob Tremblay is the standout performer, as Jack. At a tender age,
Tremblay effortlessly showcases a variety of emotions as Jack. Jacob
Tremblay has a bright future in Hollywood. Sean Bridgers is great as
Old Nick. Joan Allen is brilliant as Nancy. William H. Macy is awesome
as Robert. Tom McCamus is excellent as Leo. The supporting cast did a
superb job, as well. Room is a must watch. It is not just the best
movie of the year but also, one of the best movies of all time. An
instant classic!

Rounding out the Best Picture nominees that I hadn't already seen (I'll
be getting to the rest, don't you worry), is Room. This one is about,
according to IMDb:After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed
surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a
thrilling discovery."A strange one, based on a book that I haven't read. So, I won't be
making any comparisons to the book in this review. Plus, an adaptation
should be able to stand alone, and not require extra reading to be a
complete experience. Moving on.Ultimately Room is a success, it's got some pretty great performances
and direction, and the movie is put together really well. Brie Larson
does a really great job, and you are pulled into her world and really
feel her frustrations. Jacob Tremblay is massively annoying, but I
think that falls directly in line with his character. While Jack and Ma
are stuck in Room, you feel the tension that the small space creates in
very believable ways. Still though, he's really irritating.One of the biggest standouts of this movie is the editing. Especially
once Jack escapes from the titular Room. You see the world from his
perspective, and the way the scenes are shot and edited together fill
you with a very real feeling of being overwhelmed, and experiencing an
entire world that you've never seen. It's nice to see filmmakers who
know how to SHOW and not tell.This certainly won't be making any of my "favourite movies ever" lists,
but it really does work to communicate an effective story. It's not my
pick for Best Picture either, but I'm not going to pretend that it's
unwatchable.This one is up for Best Picture, Best Lead Actress (Brie Larson), Best
Directing, and Best Adapted Screenplay. There's a good chance for
adapted screenplay or maybe Lead Actress, but those are the strongest
impressions for me.The main characters are Ma and Jack, so you do have a solid female
character driving the movie. She's pretty dynamic and interesting too,
the things that she is willing to do (or more specifically, have Jack
do) in order to escape are pretty intense and staggering. That said,
like Brookyln, this movie is lacking in the department of characters
who are not cisgendered, heterosexual, white people. (With that total
sitting at zero, once again).

How many times in your life have you been forced to finish a bad movie,
book, or story, all the while just wishing it would end? Rarely is that
longing as desperate in our reality as it is for the characters in
Room. When Jack screams at his Ma, "I want a different story!", you
know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime
yarn. Her response, "No! This is the story you get!", punctuates their
situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly
knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life
suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle
moments of love to make it one of the year's best. If you can't tell,
I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's
a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson
(maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of
intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room
could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly
optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and
beautifully grace-filled This compassion for its subjects is thanks in
no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young
actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful
look at childish naïveté, he gives us one of the most amazing examples
childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme
(determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as
much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is
a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured.

My journey with Room started in July last year. I saw the title on the
source material I use for film release dates and I was intrigued by it.
I read the plot and viewed the trailer and very quickly decided I
really wanted to see it. Extremely rare for me. I thought it was
strange. Then I read up. I discovered there was a novel to this point I
was unaware of and that the novelist had done the screenplay. Nothing
changed opinion wise until three weeks to a month ago when the reviews
started arriving. On reading them numerous people were saying from all
sides how emotionally affecting it was and how marked Brie and Jacob's
performances were. Fast forward to yesterday when I finally sat down to
see it. At this point I felt as if it was equal in significance to any
film I've seen accounting for my emotions towards it and feedback
response.Believe me it did not disappoint. Incredibly emotional throughout and I
really felt it. I think because the seriousness of their situation is
so expertly vividly outlined. You understand that they are struggling
to survive without many essentials and there's obstacles at almost
every turn.Brie and Jacob's performances were astounding and filled with
tenderness and massive emotion. Lenny Abrahmson dealt absolutely
brilliantly with portraying the situation without overdoing the
dramatic feel. In fact he captured it perfectly. I've never reacted to
any film in the manner that I did to this one. I extremely rarely show
my emotion anywhere but particularly in public. I found myself on the
verge of tears multiple times. Had I lost my composure I would have
struggled to regain it. It wasn't because I was emotionally heightened
for it due to it's ultra significance to me. Only due to the fact of
the massively raw, stark, immensely powerful nature of it. It's
possibly the most important film to me I've ever seen at the cinema.
Certainly equal as stated earlier. I won't forget this for a long time
maybe never. Bring tissues it's an extremely difficult harrowing watch
at times. Totally absorbing, incredibly moving and to echo Mark Kermode
you must see Room. It's my film of the year as of yesterday. I don't
envy the films charged by me with the task of surpassing it. I am
forever grateful to all involved. Unforgettable. 10/10

This movie has made an obvious, profound effect on me, since I can't
seem to stop thinking about it, talking about, or writing about it. The premise is both emotional and frightening. The idea can be more
horrifying than some horror movies, especially if you take into
consideration the fact that these types of things actually happen. The connection between Ma and yourself is almost immediate. Even if you
don't know what's exactly coming (my case, since I never watched any
trailers), the emotion and soul she irradiates is obvious from the
start. Through the movie you feel with her, fear for her, and just love
her for the love that she has for her son, Jack. Watching her as she
does everything she can to make Jack's life "normal" is both heart
breaking, and heartwarming. Jacks innocence, his naivety from
everything on the outside, and his own way of "coping" with something
he doesn't even realize he's coping with, it tugs at your heart. You
feel for this kid, as you feel for the mother, and yet he knows nothing
else. We want him to have a normal life, when to him, his life is
normal.As amazing and strong as the premise is, the way the film was made is
simply put, amazing. The acting is superb, especially from Brie Larson
and Jacob Tremblay. You're not watching an actress and actor play
mother and son; you are watching a mother and son. The internal dialogue the Jack provides, as well as the dial he
verbalizes, is great. This movie will definitely be tugging at serious heart strings. Bring
tissue for the tears you're sure to be shedding, and find your strong.

I remember seeing a trailer for "Room" months back in 2015 and being
almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal
mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't
adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a
film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and
I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its
review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a
film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in
attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional
narrative.Simply put, "Room" is the emotional movie-going experience of the
season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of
drama and science-fiction, "Room" is the kind of film that hits you
with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn
off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their
motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts
don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are
probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.The film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her
small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an
enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only
available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in
there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first,
their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that
they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the
constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality
soon enough.Seven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as "Old
Nick" (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack.
Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until
their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and
father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack
believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life
seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of "room," as
they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat,
and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed.Upon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand
new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His
entire life was predicated upon just him and his "Ma," as he was
largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them
a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and
learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside
of "room." His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons
that have haunted her since she was captured.If you look at "Room" from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama
about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life
in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and
potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a
woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of
Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's
perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of
science-fiction. While nothing about "Room" deals with supernatural or
"the unknown" in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has
never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not
only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien.This results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part
because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's "Frank," a strong
film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer
Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive
aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and
overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with
extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson."Room" is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and
Jack's daily actions in "room," Jack's attempts to socialize with other
adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life,
and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This
slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to
rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and
even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck
scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year).
With all that and more considered, "Room" is a wonderful treat of a
film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a
matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually
manage to do so.

With moments full of beautiful lyricism mixing with deep questions
about the proper fallout from serious trauma, Room is a mostly
successful turn of tiny cinema. It leaves a lasting mark in the obvious
but very well done climax. But with what seems to be the theme of the
year, what starts and ends strong stumbles along the way to that
ending, often rambling itself into too much. Certainly, here would be a
film that could have been just about the best 45 minute short anyone
could ask for... But I'm not sure it works for me as a feature.When it breaks into lyrical musings on Room, World, Space, etc. is when
this film is at its most effective, memorable, and thought-provoking.
This is probably in no small way a telling sign of the wonderful "book
author adapts screenplay of her work" aspect. Without having read the
book, I imagine those sections are lifted straight from the prose. If
not, they felt like it, and it was a feeling of a fairy tale story that
reminded me in some way of "Another Earth" in style that I longed for
more from this film.As far as the narrative goes... Based on the logline, I have to say
that the whole plot played out just about how I imagined. There were no
surprises for me, and I only felt that nagging me because it seemed
like the direction was pushing this as 'shocking surprise.' But for me,
it felt right into what I figured it would be.The performances are of a very high-quality... But I found Brie
Larson's character to be the supporting role here. It's a great
performance, don't get me wrong... But it's not the knockout punch she
gave in Short Term 12, nor is it the knockout punch I expected from the
awards season hype machine. On the other hand... Jacob Tremblay gives
one of the best performances of the year by ANYONE- regardless of age
or gender. Here is one of the finest performances by a young actor I
can recall. Goes right up there with Ms. Tatum O'Neill and Mr. Haley
Joel Osment. It is truly a wonder... The power he holds in his eyes, in
his understanding (or certainly the directors) of the confusion of the
situation... It's the glue that holds the movie together. It is well
worth the price of admission just to see this child light up the whole
world.After they break from room, the movie rambles and stumbles until the
final scene. Again... a SHORT of this- around 45 minutes in run time...
Would be perfect. I didn't feel enough holding my interest for a good
hour after the escape. But all in all, this is one that I am very glad
Hollywood made. Brie Larson is the future. I always enjoy her more than
J-Law, and can't wait to see what she does next. Her maturity and focus
is beautiful, and I'm definitely a fan.Room asks big questions, and I am still thinking about what the answers
are... I've always been fascinated by the feral experience, and this
almost went there. I'd love if it had, but that would probably take
away too much from that perfect, perfect performance by the actual lead
of the movie, Jack.

If those members of the Academy eligible to vote for Best Actress had
even the smallest sense of justice they'd strike a second Best Actress
Oscar and give one each to Saorsie Ronan and Brie Larson because God
knows what the other nominees, especially Charlotte Rampling, are even
doing on the same short list. But of course the members concerned have
long banished the word justice from their collective vocabularies as I
predicted right here on IMDb back in November, 2013, when I said in my
review of Short Term 12 that neither Larson nor the excellent movie
would even be nominated. What can I tell you. Those are the breaks. In
a perfect world everyone involved in Room from the Head Honcho right
down to the guy who carried beer would be recognized for their
contribution to one of the finest movies of the year. Okay, the people
responsible for nominating actresses got it right for once but, as if
to compensate they failed to even nominate Larson's remarkable co- star
Jacob Tremblay. Like Short Term 12 this is hardly Multiplex fodder
aimed at the popcorn set but that doesn't mean it shouldn't play in the
Multiplexes and expose the cgi sequel freaks to real filmmaking.

Emma Donoghue's Room (2010) is sublime alchemy, switching from heart
wrenching horror to endearing tenderness with an air of innocence
permeating throughout. It is a book that is so profoundly good that
immediately when I was done I realized that even though the world is
still the same everything feels different; I have changed. Narratives
like this don't come very often for me. I love the book so much that I
started and maintained a book thread in an internet forum
(http://www.xtremeplace.com/yabbse/index.php? topic=99456.0). In prose,
the harrowing subject matter is pushed to the background by using a
very clever narrative device - the entire story is told from the
perspective of a five- year-old child. We become privy to his thoughts,
his emotions and his voice of innocence. I had my doubts whether this
narrative stance could be replicated on film without losing its
emotional impact. From the get-go I realized my fears are totally
unfounded. Lenny Abrahamson has directed Emma Donoghue's adapted
screenplay magnificently and it is buoyed by two stellar performances
by Brie Larson and newcomer, Jacob Tremblay. How the film manages to avoid all the usual trappings of exploitation
and emotionally manipulativeness is a case of absolute marvel. Room
deftly dances around these big holes of hysterics and histrionics, but
yet still manages to make the horrendous situations feel authentic and
heart-hitting. From top to bottom the cast shines, especially with Brie
Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson has turned in a career defining
performance and I think she is the one to beat at the Oscars. Such
humanity and honesty, and through her character arc we are graced with
what a mother would do for a child. She essentially creates a cocoon to
nurture her child and to protect him from the cruel reality. Newcomer
Jacob Tremblay is also phenomenal and he carried the film's weight on
his little shoulders. He would of course say it is his long hair that
gave him "strong". This is not a dutiful and obedient boy that does
everything his Ma says. They do quarrel and have shout-fests but their
diamond-hard bond is the beating heart of the story. I do feel the movie is largely spoiler free but I don't think I should
say more on what happens after their escape from Room. The second half
is essentially their journey back into the world and I am thankful that
the movie doesn't whitewash everything into a stroll towards a golden
sunset. Just like reading the book, I came out of the cinema feeling everything
has changed, and I am grateful for the story of an unconquerable love
between a mother and her child in harrowing circumstances. This is the
first great film I have seen this year and I feel it is a profound
cinematic and emotional experience to have lived in Room for two hours.
Do yourself a favor by checking in at the earliest convenience.

Room keeps the viewer in suspense as it slowly unravels the story of
how mother, Brie Larson and son, Jacob Tremblay is stagnantly held
captive for years until finally Brie has the sudden courage for a
spontaneous escape. Brie brilliantly portrays the trauma she's
experienced when she returns home to her parents...sadness looms in the
air for the entire movie as everyone involved tries to regain their
normal life. The movie is at times slow, but Jacob saves the movie with
his innate, youthful curiosity to make sense of the world. The mellow
ambiance makes one ponder about the usage of time, the importance of
support and not taking things for granted. Overall, great movie.

This movie is pretty much perfect. The story is one that will grab you
and stay with you. I am amazed and more then pleased with how well
these characters are written. And the actors did an awesome job of
portraying them. Alison Brie is amazing and the little boy well I have
no words. I do not know how such a young child managed to act out such
a complicated role so incredibly well.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. I was enthralled from
start to finish. And I have the attention span of a 5 year old so thats
saying something.Its a movie any red blooded movie lover needs to see.

Which of the following situations would you find the most traumatic?
(1) You are kidnapped, removed from everyone and everything you know
and love, never knowing if you will ever be free again. (2) You are
born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most
people take for granted as "the world" and then are suddenly thrust
into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing,
what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation
would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see
both situations play out in the fictional drama "Room" (R, 1:58).
Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does
have a strong basis in reality  in the cases that we occasionally see
on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive
by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some
cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing
but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on.Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was seventeen when a man who claimed that he
needed help with a sick dog abducted Joy and imprisoned her in the
garden shed in his back yard. The man (Sean Bridgers), whose name Joy
didn't know (simply referring to him as "Old Nick") kept Joy as a sex
slave, bringing her just enough food and other essentials to survive.
He brought her supplies once a week, but visited her for sex every
night. Eventually, Old Nick's ongoing rape of Joy produced a baby boy.
Joy named him Jack. Jack only knows Joy as "Ma". He has never even seen
Old Nick. At a set time every night, Joy sends Jack to sleep on the
floor of the wardrobe in the corner of the room. Old Nick punches a
code into the door's electronic lock. He enters. He does "his business"
and leaves. Jack is now free to climb into bed with Ma.The days belong to Joy and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). He's now five years
old. He has never had a haircut, never seen a doctor and never left
Room. The wardrobe where he sleeps when Old Nick comes calling, Ma's
bed, a toilet, bathtub, sink, toaster oven, small table and old
television is all Jack has ever known. As far as he knows, the world he
sees on TV is all made up and the small skylight in the roof of the
shed is outer space. To Jack, there simply is nothing else but Room,
the mysterious voice of Old Nick, and Ma. For her part, Joy does all
she can for Jack. She "cooks" the meager rations that Old Nick brings
and she breastfeeds Jack. She's his teacher, his playmate, his
protector and, basically the only person who exists.As hard as Joy works to make a life for her and Jack in Room, their
situation is starting to change, calling their long-term survival into
question. Joy has tried to escape before, but it becomes clear to her
that she has to try again. Maybe Jack is now old enough to help  if
she can get him to understand her plan. It isn't a spoiler to reveal
that Joy's escape plan works, because that is what the second half of
this movie is about. Joy is reunited with her mother (Joan Allen) and
father (William H. Macy), who are now divorced. Joy and Jack move in
with her mother and her mother's boyfriend (Tom McCamus) who do their
best to help Joy and Jack adjust to their newfound freedom, with all
that means for each of them.These adjustments aren't be easy. Jack has to learn everything that
you and I take for granted about our world. Joy has to try to get past
the emotional trauma of seven years of captivity and having raised a
son in that environment. Then, of course, there are certain legal
questions that a family lawyer is now there to handle and the media
circus that naturally accompanies such stories in real life. This film
doesn't dwell on the legal or public aspects of this case, but those
elements are there in the background, even while this dramatically
changed family focuses on finding a way to forge fresh bonds and move
forward in the most difficult of situations."Room" is as remarkable as the story it portrays. Basing the film on
the 2010 novel by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) frees
the plot to explore a wide variety of issues without being confined to
the details of one specific real-life case. Telling the story through
Jack's eyes (complete with a judicious use of well-written narration by
the boy) helps us to understand the wide ranging implications of such
an experience for Jack, his mother and his newfound family. Director
Lenny Abrahamson takes full advantage of these story-telling
opportunities with his use of camera angles and the markedly different
tone in the movie's very different halves. Topping it all off are
exceptionally affecting performances by all the main characters 
especially Larson and Tremblay. Although the pacing of the film
sometimes lags unnecessarily, there is no criticizing this film's
emotional impact and the importance of the lessons that it teaches its
audience. I have no room to give this film anything less than an "A".

It shows you how devastating is the life of a mother who has been
kidnapped for seven years with her son Jack, who just turn five. The
film in deeps the complexity of the situation by showing the emotional
repercussions of not just the mother and the son, but the grandparents
after the kidnapped; and the particularity of jack, who doesn't have
real knowledge of the real world, other than what he sees in the TV and
it's unable to comprehend properly. The story it's narrated at times
for jack, what gives it a bit of innocence and helps to balance out the
strong subject. Both actors are exceptional, especially Jacob Tremblay,
who despite of his short age is able to portray a wide of complex
emotions in a terrific way.

Brie Larson's performance in this film is beyond question one of the
best performances I've seen by a woman in a long time. This film starts
with a mother and a son living in close confines. You think at the
start they are just poor, but you begin to realise they are locked in a
shed and the mother has been held captive for seven years. She tries to
make the room a safe place for her son to grow up. But then one day
decides she has to use her son to escape. This leads to an emotional
roller-coaster of a film that doesn't let go the whole way through.
This is not an easy to film to watch, so many emotions going on below
the surface. I had seen Brie Larson in movies when she was a kid, but I
had no idea she could be this good. What her character has to go
through his horrific in itself. But she shows courage and a strong will
to survive. There is so much emotional depth to her character. She
shows love for her son, uses her survival instincts and a real strength
has a human being to want to live in the real world again. The
performance is astonishing and the performance by Jacob Tremblay as the
young son is equally powerful. If you love great movies and
performances, and can take this subject matter you must see this movie.
Brie Larson better prepare a speech at the Oscar's because this the
most sure front runner I've seen in a long time.

Sorry for my bad English but i guess writing in swiss German would not
be helpful;-)The Reason that people rate Movies like this under 8 Stars is because
the have no childreen! And people that rate Movies like this under 5
will never have childreen in their life because their heart is to cold
for love! How can it be that Users rate this with 1 Star? watching
their account and realize that they rate rape movies with 10 stars
makes me sick and i think there's already enough sick people in this
sick world exactly like the guy in this movie. it's a very long time
ago that i could not hold back my tears when watching a movie but this
one just hit me real heard. This movie just made me going up stairs to
my 6 years old boy sleeping in the bed. i just wanted to hold him and
be thankful that he has a wonderful life. Watch it, like it, rate it positive!

It's hard for me to fully express the staggering impression that Room
left on me using only the written word, but I'll have a go at it
anyway. First I'll say that it's hands down my favourite film of the
year thus far, and I left the theatre with many emotions swelling in
me, affected in a way the only a small group of films have been able do
for me. It's a patient, mature study in psychology and a sweeping
symphony of complicated emotions revolving around a terrible, tragic
situation that seems like a well of hurt and pain until in climbs it's
way out into a tenderly heartfelt, incredibly life affirming resolution
that never dips into half assed melodrama and feels earned and
appropriate. The film casts such a powerful spell that it briefly
changed the concept of time for me; Upon arriving near the end, I felt
as if years had actually passed for me in theatre since I embarked on
the film's journey. The camera, script and actors kept me so intimately
close to the characters for the duration of the piece and made me love
and care for them so much that it brought me right into their timeline
with an intimacy that rarely happens for me in cinema. Now on to the
actors. What brave, compelling work from every single performer on
screen, right down to the bit parts. Every role castes with a sharp eye
for detail and reverent contemplation of who is right for what,
creating a roster of heavy hitters and up and comers to be reckoned
with. Brie Larson gives a beyond award worthy turn as Joy, a girl who
was kidnapped at a young age and held captive by a horrible man (Sean
Bridgers, displaying smouldering volatility in terrifying proportions)
who impregnates her. She raises the child in the dour, tiny garden shed
he keeps her in. Faced with the unthinkable task of creating a
nurturing environment for her little one, she tells him that the shed
is 'Room', their kingdom, and that the people he sees on their little
TV are fake, imparting that they and their captor are the only real
ones and there is no outside world. This reminds just how mouldable our
minds are when we are small, and the film beautifully explores the
psychological ramifications of how we raise our young, how nature vs.
nurture comes into play in startling ways during the darkest of times,
and the decisions we are forced to make on our own to ensure that our
children are safe, even when things have gone beyond wrong, as they
have for the poor girl. Old Nick, as she nicknames their captor, rapes
her every few days, and treats the two of them like animals. Her son
Jack reaches an age where escape becomes vital in his mothers eyes, and
she takes her chance, orchestrating a harebrained ditch effort to break
free, which is my favourite sequence of the film. It's also one of the
most tension filled, seat gripping scenes I've ever seen, as the
character buildup has set our personal stakes epically high, which
combined with the excellent set up makes for a clammy nightmare of an
escape. The director makes the fascinating choice not to use any music
at all until they reach freedom, which I noted. As soon as they are
out, I let out a cathartic, audible sigh of relief, as the dank hell
they undeservedly spent almost a decade in gives way to a vibrant,
strange new world for little Jack. The camera takes his perspective and
pores over every aspect of the outside realm with the patience and
curiosity it takes to place us in his psyche, a child viewing the world
in its entirety and true form for the very first time, essentially a
second birth, a theme which the film handles marvellously. I must speak
about Jacob Tremblay, a Vancouver native who plays Jack and gives the
most soul wrenching performance I've ever seen from a child actor. The
levels of sheer intuition and innocent truth he infuses in his work at
such a young age are just unbelievable, and he should be in the riding
for Oscar gold as well. Larson and him have uncanny chemistry, the love
shown in the early scenes a blooming Rose of hope that fends off the
looming darkness they dwell in, which is tested by the inevitable
complications they face upon entering the real world once again. Larson
burst onto the scene with 21 Jump Street and Don Jon, fun but
inconsequential fluff. Here she shows us that she means business, and
wants to tell stories that are important, and show audiences what it
means to be human through her work. I look forward to where this
extraordinary girl takes us in her next cinematic journey. Joan Allen
makes subtly heartbreaking work as Joy's mother, William H. Macy is
briefly present as her Dad, Tom McCamus makes compassionate work of her
stepdad and like I said, everyone else is superb, right down to the day
players. I was crippled by emotion and raw with nerve jangling suspense
after this one, exiting the theatre soaring on the high I eternally
strive for in my cinematic adventures. The fact that only one theatre
in Vancouver is playing this one is an affront to the universe. Get
down to Tinseltown and see this one before it's gone. You'll thank me.

What a great story! When I bought a ticket, I didn't expect this movie
to be so deep and honest. Abrahamson's good direction and Brie Larson's
and Jacob Tremblay's amazing acting make this movie almost
documentary-like. It just all looks too real and too realistically
painful to be a feature film.Movie starts with a mother and her son, Jack, and their story about how
they were locked in "Old Nick's shed" for 7 years (although Jack is
only 5 - I think you can guess what that means). The kid never saw the
outside world and believes that everything can either belong to the
"Room world" or "TV world". The clash between him and his mom about is
she lying about the outside world or not produces one of the greatest
and best-acted scenes of the whole year.Among all the people that deserved the acclaim for this beautiful movie
and beside Amrahamson, Larson and Tremblay, I want to point out Emma
Donoghue's great success in adapting her own bestseller into a very
clever and touching screenplay. Also, Joan Allen did a great job as
Joy's mother (Jack's grandma). I really really hope she gets nominated
for the Academy Award for her performance.Talking about Oscars, I think Brie Larson has a pretty good chances at
not just getting nominated, but also winning the award in February.
Young Jacob, on the other side, has a pretty serious competition in the
Supporting Actor category (Keaton and Ruffalo, (both frontrunners) from
"Spotlight", Rylance from "Bridge of Spies", Rogen from "Steve Jobs",
Dano, Del Toro, Elba, and possibly Stallone and Hardy), so he should be
really satisfied with just getting a nod. It's very sad such a good
performance might be overlooked only because he is still a kid (and we
know Academy rarely favors child actors).If there is a movie that will get overlooked in the next couple of
months, I think it will be "Room". Go buy your movie ticket right now
and prevent that from happening. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.Movie rating: 8.9/10My "Best Movies of 2015" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls031061874/ My "Best Movies Ever Made" list: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls072746304/

Please, please, please. Can you make room for about two minutes to read
my review of the movie "Room"? This movie is a haunting look at the
emotional & survival aspects of child abduction seen through the eyes
of a young boy. That boy's name is Jack; his mother Joy was abducted as
a teen and held captive for numerous years. The despicable excuse for a
human being who abducted Joy impregnated her and the result was Jack.
The first half of the movie is captured in the shed "room" where Joy &
Jack are held captive and it shows them both go through their normal
daily routine, and their mother to child interactions. It is very
disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds
them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his
captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on
television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue
who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of "Room" is
stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy & Jack
are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the
picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers
that Joy & Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting;
my only minor critique of "Room" was in the film's unrealistic ending
which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in
my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy
who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as
Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the
real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also
strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy
as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I
will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all
those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for "Room". *****
Excellent

After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed
surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a
thrilling discovery.The difference between this film and a B-grade thriller or revenge film
is in the level of performance achieved by the two leads, Brie Larson
and Jacob Tremblay. They are the beginning middle and end of everything
good about this film. (And luckily, they are strong enough to cancel
out William H. Macy, who is horribly miscast in this movie.) There is no doubt that Brie Larson will win the Oscar for Best Actress,
and no doubt that she deserves it. After her picking up a Golden Globe
and a SAG Award, it would be very strange to applaud anyone else. She
is strong, weak, sad, elated, protective and terrified. This is just
about the fullest range of emotions that a person can have, especially
in under two hours on screen.Many have noted that Jacob Tremblay is equally good. Some say he is
even better than Larson (and that is quite possible). Yet he did not
get a nomination. This is definitely unfortunate. Whether he is on par
with Leonardo DiCaprio's strength this year is hard to say, but it
seems that Tremblay easily was more intense, more memorable than Matt
Damon. With all due respect to Matt Damon.Not having read the book, I can make no commented on the adapted
screenplay. I think the script we end up with is excellent, but if the
award is for the adaptation, that might be more difficult to call.This leaves Best Director and Best Picture. I find it very unlikely
that Lenny Abrahamson will win. He definitely deserves to be in this
category, and he has risen relatively quickly. 2014's "Frank" was a
quirky little film that deserved more attention, and "Room" is going to
launch him into the A-list. His next film is rumored to be a Civil War
story, and although that has been done to death (what hasn't?), many
eyes will now be on it.And Best Picture? That would be quite the upset. Some people have
really gotten behind the film. Richard Roeper, for example, thinks
"Room" is one of the best films of the decade. He would love to see
"Room" go home with the little golden man. But it would be an uphill
fight. Most likely it will end up taking third or fourth place (and we
are not privy to the votes).

Based on the book by Emma Donoghue, from what I heard about this film I
thought it may have similar vibe to Oldboy (without the violence), I
knew a little about the concept, but it turned out to be even better
than anything I could have expected, from Oscar nominated director
Lenny Abrahamson (Frank). Basically twenty-four- year-old Joy "Ma"
Newsome (Golden Globe winning, Oscar and BAFTA nominated Brie Larson)
and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a squalid shed
they call "Room", sharing a bed, toilet, bathtub, television and a
rudimentary kitchen, the only window is a skylight. A man called Old
Nick (Sean Bridgers), Jack's father, abducted Joy seven years ago and
has held her and Jack captive ever since, he routinely rapes her while
Jack sleeps in the wardrobe, Joy is overcome sometimes with depression
and suffers malnutrition, but tries to stay optimistic for her son.
Having been in Room since he was born, Jack has been allowed by Joy to
believe that everything he sees on television, from the rest of the
world, is make believe, and that only Room and its contents are "real".
This changes however when Old Nick tells Joy he has lost his job and
threatens he may not be able to afford future supplies, so Joy decides
to finally tell Jack the truth, there really is an outside world,
everything on television is real, he reacts dramatically with disbelief
and a lack of understanding. To stand a chance of getting out of Room,
Joy trains Jack to fake a fever, hoping Old Nick will have no choice
but to take him to hospital, but instead he says he return and bring
antibiotics. Joy has Jack play dead so that she can wrap him in a
carpet, in the hope that Old Nick will remove him from Room, he falls
for this trick and places a wrapped up Jack in the back of his pickup
truck, driving through a residential area, Jack is stunned by exposure
to the outside world, but jumps from the truck and attracts the
attention of a passer-by. Old Nick tries to take Jack back, but gets
away before he can be questioned or caught, the police question a
startled Jack about what has happened to him, he slowly explains about
where he and his mother are being held, they soon identify the location
of the shed and Joy is also rescued, they are both taken to a hospital.
In the hospital Joy is reunited with her parents, father Robert
(William H. Macy) and mother Nancy (Joan Allen), who she learns have
divorced, Nancy is now married to new husband Leo (Tom McCamus), Jack
is still overwhelmed by all the new things and people approaching him.
Joy and Jack return to her childhood home where Nancy and Leo live,
Robert cannot accept Jack and leaves, Jack initially struggles to adapt
to life in the larger world outside of Room, speaking only to his
mother about his feelings, even expressing a desire to return to Room.
Joy struggles with anger and depression about the seven years taken
from her and her son, she argues with her mother, and during a
television interview about what happened reacts angrily, she finally
has a breakdown and attempts suicide, but survives and is taken to
hospital. With his mother recovering, Jack slowly shows signs of
adapting and settling into his new life, bonding with his grandmother,
Leo and his dog, playing with toys he has been given, and he meets and
plays with a boy his age, he also finally allows his grandmother to cut
his long hair, his "strong", so he can send it to his mother in
hospital. Joy returns home and thanks Jack for saving his life again,
he asks her if he can see Room again one last time, she agrees to his
request and they visit room, escorted by a police officer, Jack feels
that with the door open and light coming in that is has shrunk, Joy
assures him it is the same place, Jack and Joy says his final goodbyes
to Room, and they leave to continue life in the bigger world. Also
starring Cas Anvar as Dr. Mittal, Matt Gordon as Doug, Amanda Brugel as
Officer Parker and Joe Pingue as Officer Grabowski. Larson gives a
compelling and career-minting performance as the emotionally drained
mother who has had life stolen by a terrible situation and longs to
escape, but this film almost completely belongs to newcomer Tremblay,
who (with his long hair could be mistaken for a girl for a long while)
is exceptional as the youngster whose whole life revolves around the
small space he lives in until being gobsmacked by the realities of life
in the bigger world, the mother-son bond is highly believable. The
novel was inspired by the case of Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man who
incarcerated his daughter in a basement for 24 years and systematically
raped and impregnated her, but obviously the crime element is lessened.
The incarceration and claustrophobia works fantastically for the dark
first half, then when the break into the outside occurs it really
delves into the complexities of the real world, this is absolutely from
the point of view of the innocent child, it is nightmarish and
emotional in and out of Room, but it is ultimately thrilling, uplifting
and a well executed story, a must see drama. It is nominated the Oscar
for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Screenplay Based
on Material Previously Produced or Published for Emma Donoghue, it is
nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated
the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.
Very good!

Some movies you watch. They may be touching, they may be entertaining,
but sitting in the dark you are always aware that you are watching a
movie that has been created to entertain you. Some movies sweep you
along, caressing your empathy and tugging at your heart, enveloping you
in the experience of the movie itself. So it is with Room, the new and
exciting film that captures the wonder and joy of life's simplicities
and celebrates the power of human resilience. With a unique voice from
director Lenny Abrahamson, breathtaking, nuanced performances from Brie
Larson and the young Jacob Tremblay and a rich visual world captured
through the eyes of innocence, Room is not to be missed!Seven years before Room begins, a seventeen year old girl was abducted
and trapped in a sound proofed, electronically locked shed by a man
known only as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers/Trumbo, Sweet Home Alabama) who
has kept...Read the full review on David 'n the Dark!https://davidnthedark.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/roomreview/

Envision spending your entire life confined to a single room, the size
of a shed, with just a small skylight as your only perception of the
outside world. For Jack (Jacob Tremblay), this was his life. This was
all he knew. Room (2015) is a film based off of the best-selling novel
by Emma Donoghue, told through the eyes of Jack, the five year old son
of Ma (Brie Larson). Jack and Ma escape from this small confinement and
attempt to adjust to something Jack never knew existed, the world.Room is a small story driven independent movie. And like many of its
kind, Room has to rely on a great screenplay, solid acting, and moving
character development for it to get wide recognition. Room delivers on
all of these aspects. You know a movie really tugs on the heartstrings
when you notice multiple viewers in the theater crying during specific
scenes. Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson are near flawless together on
screen as they depict the highs and lows of being confined to a single
room for years, as well as their transition back to society.It was very interesting to witness the depictions of what a child would
believe as real, or not, based upon what he has been deprived of.
Luckily, Jack and Ma have a television, but Ma has had to shelter Jack
from some aspects of what really is going on outside of the 10x10 shed
because she fears what this knowledge might bring to him. Real, TV
world, space, aliens, and people are concepts that are different to
Jack. The only other person he sees besides Ma, is old Nick (Sean
Bridgers), whom Jack only sees through the cracks of the wardrobe he
sleeps in.Once they escape this world called room, director Lenny Abrahamson is
tasked with showing how Jack adjusts to this seemingly alien planet.
Both trauma and confusion seem accurately depicted as Jack and Ma both
have mixed responses to what Jack has never known, and what Ma's life
used to be. By the end of the movie, it felt satisfyingly complete, as
it touched back on the initial openings, reoccurring themes, and
feelings of closure for Jack and Ma.As mentioned above, the film does receive a standing ovation from
bringing the viewers to feel deep compassion for the character.
However, the times of suspense should only get a pat on the back. The
sense of danger, fear, and urgency does not seem to suck you in. Part
of this was attributed to the score that at times seemed more redundant
and annoying. What seemed to be the same piano notes only appeared
during scenes of sadness, awe, and joy, but nothing was there to
enhance the other scenes.The only criticism of the directorial style was the lapse in direction
that the story was supposed to take towards the end of the film. The
entire time the story was told through the eyes of Jack. However,
towards the last part of the movie, there was a shift that included
some of Ma's point of view. This slightly took away from the ways a
five year old would try to explain certain behaviors or actions of
adults. Also, for those who have read the book, don't expect the movie
to include every aspect of it. Just like every other film based on
books, graphic novels, comics, or even true events, only certain
aspects can be adapted and some must be altered in order to try and
make the best move possible.Room is definitely an emotional journey through trauma and discovery.
It has very strong storytelling and acting. Room fell short in some
aspects, though they did not sufficiently diminish the overall
experience of the film. It brings different concepts for those to learn
from, such as the importance of family, experience, and empathy towards
others. If you want to escape the confinements of recent big budget
films, or want to experience something moving that you will not forget,
go see Room. Room earns an unwavering 8/10.Read more movie reviews and discussions from

Imagine, if you will, being born and raised in a small, square, space
with only a skylight from which to see the outside world. How would
living in such confines define the person? What happens to that world
view when the outside comes crashing in? This is the story we watch
unfold in "Room".In a complete change from his last film, "Frank", Lenny Abrahamson's
"Room" stars Brie Larson as Ma and her now five year old son, Jake,
played by Jacob Tremblay. Ma and Jake live together in a room with two
chairs, a table, a bent spoon, a bed, a sink, and a wardrobe. Why they
live in such a confined space is the basis for the first half of the
movie. The second half is what happens when they break free from the
room and Jake discovers a vastly bigger room on the outside. The film
is told mostly from his perspective, which could be disastrous, but
with Tremblay's magnificent acting, and a script which carefully
understands a child's perceptions, this technique works to the film's
advantage. It is not too saccharine and for the most part, believable.I would be shocked if this film does not net Brie Larson with at least
an Academy Award nomination. Her portrayal of a mother in unbelievable
circumstances is nothing short of brilliant. Easily the best movie of
the year that I have seen so far, but one so emotionally engaging, that
it left me drained. If you chose to watch "Room", and I do recommend
it, bring plenty of tissues. There wasn't a dry eye in the theater.

I had no idea what I was in store for when I saw this film. This is a
phenomenal piece of cinema. Words can't describe how incredible this
film is. It's a masterpiece. I've never seen a film dealt with in such
a realistic way. This film was an emotional roller-coaster, I was in
tears many times throughout this movie. This film has the best acting
of the year. Brie Larson gives the best female performance in years. Who surprised
me the most was Jacob Tremblay, who gives easily one of the greatest
child performances I've ever seen. Joan Allen is great as well, and I
expect all of them to get Oscar nominations. In no way was I expecting
to be as engaged as I was in this film, because I was absolutely
mesmerized. Lenny Abrahamson's directing is incredible. He allows you
to really understand these characters, and you feel all the emotion and
passion poured on-screen. This film is heartbreaking, but heartwarming at the same time. I
guarantee anyone who sees this will cry. It's incredible. I hope it
wins Best Picture, it deserves it. This is the best film so far this
year, 9.8/10.

"Flashbacks and dream sequences are traded for raw, uninterrupted life
in the room that boldly encapsulates 94 of the film's 188-minute
runtime. The shed's cold interior is wearied on the eyes, Jack and
Joy's various crafts applying faint signs of life, and as we are left
to witness a darkly beautiful incubated snapshot of a mother-son
relationship; the anger, the amendments, the curiosity, the tears, the
laughs. And surrounding it all are four unforgiving walls, which, once
knocked down, the simplest joys of a boy and a dog, bedrooms, family
dinners make for some of the most uniquely liberating cinematic moments
of recent memory."FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/10/29/room-review-indie-adam/

This is one of those movies that the IMDb rating tricks you into
believing is better than it actually is. The IMDb synopsis also makes
you believe that you are being taken on a journey - of the struggles of
being held captive, into the psyche of the captor, of the innocence of
childhood, of motherly love that triumphs. You probably imagine some
sort of "Life is Beautiful" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned.
This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a
room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue
to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one
dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You
end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal.
Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard. The quickly made TV
documentaries after kidnapped victims are rescued (as in the case of
Elizabeth Smart or Amanda Berry) look like Oscar winning stories in
contrast and are actually watchable. This movie is plain painful to
watch.

The most beautiful movie I've ever seen with outstanding performances.
Especially Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson is awesome as always. I believe
the Film makers wanted to provide another message from the movie. They
want us to see the movie from the Child's perspective who don't know
anything about outside world. That's what we are, We are just like the
child. We have made this "Room" in our own head, we don't know nothing
about anybody, we accept our destiny, whether we wanted it or not, over
the course of life and time. We just live, live and go on living our
life in our own head which is depicted as a "Room" in this movie.
Escape from what you don't want to be, You don't have to live your life
on someone else's terms. This world is beautiful if you get out of your
"Room". ❤

"Room" is certainly one of the most compelling and interesting drama
movies of this year the plot and story is just so different and
complex. The film is a harrowing tale of a young boy named
Jack(beautiful work from Jacob Tremblay)who along with his Ma(Brie
Larson)is trapped and confined for many years in an enclosed room with
a 10-by-10-foot space to live in. Thru it all Ma coaches and cares for
Jack along the way by reading him stories and singing him songs and
putting him to bed with warm love and food. It just goes to show what
it's like and how a person must make it when their life is a shelter
away from the norm and society. Then all of a sudden the second half of
the film takes a spin a twist as when the two escape an outside world
is discovered by the little boy and mom. As the grandparents of Jack
are found the loving yet tough accepting Nancy(Joan Allen)and
Robert(William H. Macy). Most revealing and different is how little
Jack sees an open world of sight and sound as it's an adjustment it's
clearly not what he was use to with Ma. Overall this film proves that
each and everyone leads their own little sheltered life in their own
way and world. And true when one ventures out a new world of sight and
sound and mind is discovered as each world and room for that matter is
of different sight and it gives off a different feel for everyone.
"Room" is one drama that sets free the character and viewer to
discovery of new sight and to a new look of life.

This is the Ugliest film i have ever seen, the idea is good but there
is a lot of weakness in the script and in directing. The boy is a clown
or what? We all thought he was a girl? What are you trying to do? Does
a boy really watch dora? Is it so difficult to cut his hair a little
bit? All you want to do is showing us how a boy can become GAY ? Or you
want him to be gay? It is really sad and the sadest thing is that
people adore such movies , 8,6 for this movie? Is this movie better
than schindler's list? Better than Titanic? And The pianist? And many
others uplifting movies? You should open your eyes people, your ears
and do not accept everything the garbage gives you.

This is a perfect example of a film that sold me just by its premise: A
boy who has been kept in one room his entire life by his mother, begins
to wonder what the limits of the world beyond the walls of the enclosed
area are. It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you
shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDb synopsis.
Just go out and see one of the best films of the year. Brie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in,
plays Joy, mother of Jack. Larson hides the depths of her character for
a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the
more powerful later on. The story of a mother and son trying to escape
this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to
greatness. The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the
film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps
going. It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and
rhythm of the movie isn't always there. Which is why the emotional
moments midway through are what stick out to me most.Jacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack. At 5 years old and an
extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some
awards attention as well. He pulls off every emotion that is called of
him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better. The
supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler
territory so I'll stick with the two leads. I also should mention Lenny
Abrahamson's directing. I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly
Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that
follow. Room as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the
performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take
you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.+Larson+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly+Emotional journey+Meticulous directing-Second half doesn't live up to the first8.7/10

Jacob Tremblay was amazing actor in the film "Room", as he could really
perform his role powerfully. I thought film had some good acting in it.
The story was weak. I did want to get into the world of the kidnapper
so that I could feel more for Ma and Jack.Why this kidnapper put them
in this situation? That would have been more interesting. I was
confined to this little room for more than 40 minutes of the film.
Suddenly Ma decides that Jack has to help them get out of this
situation. He was able to run away very easily and then the rest of the
film was about their life at the grandparents. William Macy is a great
actor but I don't know why he was needed in this role. He could have
been a good kidnapper. Ma attempting suicide was not believable as no
one who had been confined to a room would ever imagine committing
suicide after what they both went through and were given a new life.Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were good as actors so I have some hope
for them. Novels are whole different world from films.

I want to start off by saying I recommend you do not watch the trailer
for this film. If you do watch the trailer that's fine, but if you wish
to avoid knowing what the "second half" of this film is like then you
should avoid it.That being said, in order to avoid commenting on the second half I am
referring to, I'll try to talk about issues explored in the film rather
than plot content.The basic premise is that a woman and her son live in a shed, which
they refer to as simply "Room," years after the woman's abduction by an
older man. Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.What I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of
perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on
this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows
nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to
tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One
of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for
Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction
is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.I want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I
did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have
imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see
this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is
never violent or graphic.3.5/4.0

Room couldn't be further from Lenny Abrahamson's last film Frank, a
bizarre music-orientated comedy. Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made
Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have
a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The different approach is felt
immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters,
Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a
somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy
Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's
faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the
film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to
take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion. The concept of a mother having raised her son in confinement then
finally breaking free has many avenues to explore. Having not read Emma
Donoghue's book, of whom also wrote the screenplay, I mostly expected a
small scale -getting out of the eponymous room then reuniting and
resolving itself there. Instead, the film goes further than I expected,
getting Ma  also known as Joy, which is becoming a familiar
character's name this year  and Jack back to her teenage home with her
own mother. Then, in a way, it doesn't go far enough. But it's
interesting to watch it play in its happy medium. It does rely on some
key contrivances to get there, such as the kidnapper's wonky perception
and ultimately not fighting hard enough when he could have, but that
doesn't take away from the gripping escape sequence as the orchestra
swells and squeezes tears from you whether you like it or not. Room becomes a rehabilitation story as well as a discovery story, as
Joy struggles to re-adapt to home life and Jack is seeing the world he
only suspected but never imagined. The detail and convincing touches in
Tremblay's performance are what make it special, such as the fact that
Jack has never had to deal with stairs. The film is told mostly through
his perspective, but it's not held as a consistent theme though that
helps it be less on the nose. The first time Jack sees outside is not
the first time we see outside. But it's still cathartic as we watch him
finally see real trees and real telephone poles. While many can assume
that actors as young as Tremblay, who was 8 when he shot Room, are
coached through their roles then we can also assume he had expert
teachers. He may not carry the gravity of the film throughout, but he
nails the moments that count. Brie Larson had not only shown potential but delivered the goods with
2013's Short Term 12. It's a similar environment here with devoted
maternal instincts but this time it's pushed to the brink of her skills
as an actress. She's drenched in this exasperation that speaks to years
of exhaustion. In the tone of her primal performance, she paints a full
rich portrait of Joy's whole life from her carefree teen years to her
brutal capture by Old Nick when she was 17, to every little story and
lesson she's told Jack. Joy's constantly revising the way she raises
Jack and while there's bumps in the road, it's a complete picture of
motherhood. She balances resilience and vulnerability, hope and
dejection with a fine tooth comb. Most times she commands the screen
and offers one of the year's best performances. It's a film about the
harsh realities of growing up, operating for both of the main
characters, and it's a very sensitive and emotionally potent portrayal. Joan Allen, as Joy's mother, is heartfelt and shows unconditional love
in a wonderfully nuanced way, whereas William H. Macy, Joy's father, is
regretfully underused but doing the 'in over his head' thing Macy does
best. From one domestic space to another, it's easy to wish it would
spread its wings instead of remaining so confined. It's clear that
recovery is difficult but there was a lot more ground Room could have
covered. It loses a lot of steam after the escape, but at the very
least it never loses my investment in the characters. It's not working
on a defined timeline, or with hardly a goal in mind, so it leaves
itself a little elusive. I was either ready to jump 10 years to see how
they're doing or I accepted that it would simply end at a good enough
point. Story problems aside, it's focusing on emotion, and while it may
step into melodrama, it's always potent. It's hard to pinpoint
Abrahamson's voice as a filmmaker exactly, and he might be a little
overzealous with how he adapts his style so far, but he's certainly got
the right edge.8/10

Jack was a little boy who believed that the room he was born and raised
in for 5 years was the world, and only he and his mother live there
together. Than one day shortly after his 5th birthday, he has to come
to grasp with the fact that "Room" is a very small part of the world.I thought they handled the situation perfectly, especially Brie Larson
as Jack's Ma, Joy. Room was semi narrated by Jack, but this was his
mother's story, of how she used Jack to keep her sanity while in the
room, and she was still in that room even after she physically was let
out.It was interesting watching the two in the room living there day to day
life and how she explained the limited world they live in. It was
suspenseful as Mamma Joy used Jack as part of her plan to break free
and it was fascinating watching Joy readjusting to the world and Jack
discovering it.I thought it was a well done picture with some great acting going on
that revolves around Brie Larson but gives even small parts like the
one William H. Macy had, as a dad who can't deal with what his daughter
went though, the kind of subtle development that gets under your skin. It walks slowly buy says a lot, and I really like that.

Greetings again from the darkness. Tragically, stories of women being
held captive have become all too common in this sometimes frightening
world in which we live. Emma Donoghue had the high profile, real life
situations of Jaycee Dugard, Elisabeth Fritzl and Amanda Berry (Ariel
Castro) to draw from for her terrific novel upon which this film is
based. While not easy for anyone (especially parents) to watch, it's a
well made movie with outstanding performances  including a
career-changer from Brie Larson.Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, a critical favorite from last year)
takes us inside the world  or more accurately  the walls where Ma
(Brie Larson) and her just turning 5 year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay)
live. Seven years ago, Larson's character was abducted while walking
home from school, and since then she has given birth to Jack, and the
two have been held captive in a small shed with only a skylight
connecting to the outer spaces of life. The captor  known as Old Nick
(Sean Bridgers)  periodically brings them supplies, while also
regularly visiting to satisfy his more base needs with Ma.For the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right
along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she
is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though
in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain
the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order
for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time,
we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the
nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the
reports on real life ordeals.The second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young
Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world.
We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying
strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different
challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen),
her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The
film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to
stomach than others.Providing any more details would soften the impact of the film, and
this is one that is meant to be felt  even if it's a true kick in the
gut. The film is well cast and well acted, and young Jacob Tremblay
captures our hearts quickly and joins the short list of child actors
who go far beyond "cute" and into profound. Brie Larson exploded onto
the acting scene in Short Term 12, one of my favorite movies of 2013;
but it's here where she steps into the elite level of actresses. She
brings a tenacity and emotional strength that leaves us never doubting
whether she has "her strong".

It is difficult to produce a seriously dark film that makes the
audience feel good about having seen it, but novelist and screenwriter
Emma Donoghue has made the material, director Lenny Abrahamson has
delivered the look and feel; and astounding performances by a
23-year-old Brie Larson (Ma) and 7-year-old Jake Tremblay (playing
5-year-old Jack) take the audience through amusement, curiosity,
horror, and confusion to a climax that leaves them moist-eyed and
content that things will work out.The cinematography, considering the 10-foot square set, was brilliant.
The escape sequence, seen both from the astounded Jack's eyes as well
as a drone's eye view, grabs the viewer and makes him feel he IS little
Jack, if just for a moment.As the escape is executed, it becomes plain that this is a high-grade
chick flick. Instinctive motherhood and female mind games that most men
would never think of present revelations to those with Y chromosomes,
twists that that the brutal Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) never sees coming.
Brie Larson's acting, even as her character acts, convinces everyone.There are only three, well, two questions that much of the audience may
have: 1) Why was grampa Robert (in a fairly brief appearance by William
H Macy) unable to look at Jack? 2) Why did it take forEVer to get
Jack's hair cut? (This question is beautifully resolved, by the way.)
and 3) This is when you know it is a woman's story: Why, in seven years
of captivity, did Ma never think to stand the bed on its end and climb
out through the plastic skylight?Those questions aside, ROOM gets ten stars for acting, direction, and
cinematography. It loses three stars only for the minor plot fails.

Sometimes there are these special movies - high ratings, lots of ppl
loving them and you just wonder - is this the same movie Iam watching
ppl are talking about!? I was just well bored, almost bored to a
brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I
compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know,
different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is
comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time
wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I
heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a
person with that "kind of state" would, but Iam no specialist here.
Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be
all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is
for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't
attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no
sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the
legions of 10s, my "real" vote is a 3 but no more.

What is remarkable about this movie is that the audience members didn't
fall asleep for the first half of the movie and that's a great thing.
Unlike The Diary of Ann Franke (1959), the underlying and ominous tone
of Room doesn't have the constant and imminent death threat from Nazi
occupation that helps to sustain the visceral tension that Ann Frank
was subjected to. Instead the director was confronted with the
challenge of somehow making the mundane and likely boring life in a
small room something of modicum of interest. In a way, the audience
experiences the same efforts of the mother to keep her child
preoccupied as much as possible with the few resources possible.
Overall this movie has a deliciously balanced and sustained plot
development often times left out of the confined and happily released
plot outlines of most mystery thrillers.The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there
isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The
relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and
are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to
such a tragedy. The presentation mostly from the child's perspective
made the directorship's job tremendously more difficult but at the same
time more captivating and absorbing for the audience. Instead of the
usual death lurking around every corner horror genre or the
sensationalism of publicity drama, the movie narrowly and richly
captures the amazing and arduous behavior of the mother's attempts at
some form of normalcy and the doubts surrounding her own competence in
having done so.Like The Miracle Worker (1962), the depiction of a world beyond our own
universe, our senses, Room offers up a new way of examining our own
environment. Unlike Helen Keller, though the child in Room wasn't
limited by his senses, but by his limited surroundings. Nevertheless,
the audience is exposed to a refreshing and innovative way to
re-examine our own limited senses.

"Room" (2015 release; 117 min.) brings the story of a young lady named
Joy, and her son Jack. As the movie opens, Jack wakes up and can't wait
to tell Ma that it's his 5th birthday. He goes around the room,
exclaiming with joy "good morning rag, good morning TV, good morning
sink!". It becomes clear very quickly that, despite Jack's innocence
and joy, they are actually held captive and Jack has never known
anything other than "Room", as they call this place. Joy is trying to
figure out a way to deceive the man who is holding them captive, so as
to escape. TO tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll
just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is directed by Lenny Abrahamson, who
just last year brought us the delightfully quirky "Frank", and Emma
Donoghue, who wrote the book on which this is based, wrote the script.
I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely the movie sticks
to the book (I'm guessing quite closely, though). Second, as the
movie's trailer makes plain, Joy and Jack do end up getting out of
"Room", and as a result this movie really consists of two separate
parts: before and after, and each takes about half of the movie's
running time. The "before" part is nothing short of extraordinary, as
we observe Joy and Jack living in their cramped quarters (which look
quite big to Jack). Third, everyone's been talking about the Best
Actress Oscar chances for Brie Larson in her role of Joy/Ma, so imagine
my surprise when it turns out that yes, she is quite good, but the
young boy playing Jack simply steals the movie, period. Jacob Tremblay
brings one of the more astonishing and accomplished performances of
such a young actor or actress in recent memory. Joan Allen (as Joy's
mom) is quite powerful too, but also keep an eye out for William H.
Macy's short (less than 19 min.) but impactful role as Joy's dad."Room" opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in
Cincinnati, and I finally had an opportunity to see it. The week night
screening where I saw this at was attended surprisingly well for a week
night, which is great news. I imagine that "Room" will pick up quite a
few nominations in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so.
"Room" is an outstanding movie on so many levels, and I'd readily
suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually
on DVD/Blu-ray. "Room" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This is a movie that gets under your skin from the start. You can't
take your eyes away from where this film will go from the beginning to
the end. It's a raw look at a life of a mother and child from the start
to the finish. It's film making at its best, filled with love,
devotion, hurt, and determination to survive. The theater was silent
during the entire time, as the film develops into a series of events
that it forms over 5 years and beyond, of a life of mother and child in
a room. This is a movie with no special affects or horrific scenes.
Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are just amazing in their roles as the
two main actors in this film. If you love great movies and want to see
a film, filled with love, survival and finding life again, you must see
this gem of a film.

Held captive for years in an enclosed space, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson)
and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) finally gain their freedom
from a man known only as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), allowing the boy to
experience the outside world for the first time alongside Joy's mother
and father (Joan Allen, William H. Macy) and her mother's friend Doug
(Matt Gordon).So this is a big one. I was interested in this ever since I saw a
trailer a few months ago. I thought it looked good enough but I never
thought it was going to be this good. So the film, based on the novel
of the same name, is about a mother and son, Joy and Jack, forced to
live in what amounts to a single room. This room consists of a bedroom,
a bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Joy has been living in it for
over seven years and the room, or "Room" as Jack calls it is all he has
ever known since he is yet to experience the outside world. Room is
what is normal to him and how he sees the world has been influenced by
it. The world to him is only what is inside of the room and nothing
more. Once he and Joy finally escape the room, they (mostly Jack) must
readjust to their new lives outside the room. Jack must reshape his
view of the world and also must relearn what is real and what isn't.
The story may not seem as much but it really is a story of fear,
hopelessness and hope and most importantly a film about redemption and
family bond. The film definitely pulls you through the range of
emotions: sadness, happiness, anger, nervousness, etc (I will admit to
almost crying at a few moments). I will not give anything away here in
order to not spoil these moments. The story which was told mostly from
Jack's perspective, follows Jack's evolution and his changing view of
the world. He uses his five-year-old imagination to make the best of
out where he is and what he knows. There were plenty of moments in the
film where Jack goes on some "imagination tangents" where he would come
up with his own stories and they were infectious. You can tell that
these were happening from the child-like music and the change in the
camera. Besides all of that, the film is about the relationship between
Joy and Jack and later with them and Joy's (nameless) mother. What sold
me with all of this was the amazing acting from Larson and Tremblay
(and to a lesser extent Allen). I thought they had great chemistry with
one another and it showed (mostly in the beginning when it was just
them in a room). The cinematography here was amazing here as it helped
bring to life Jack's imagination which mostly served to advance the
plot. What also helps by telling the story from the kid's perspective,
it lightens up the rather dark subject matter in the film (and it is
very dark). I was not a big fan of the ending but I can't give it the
benefit of the doubt by not having read the film's source material.
Overall, this is a great film driven by a great story and great acting
and should not be missed as it surely likely to earn some awards.Score: 9/10 keithlovesmovies.com

Today's movie shares a big trait with True Grit that was debated when
the awards season came out; with who the main character was. True
Grit's marketing pushed that Jeff Bridges was the main actor of the
movie even though the story really shows that Haliee Steinfeld was the
focus. Once the awards season came, she was given plenty of supporting
actress accolades even though most people felt that she was more in the
reigns of best actress. Room will probably have this same issue with
one of it's actors.I think the reason the studios tend to put great child performers into
separate categories away from the big A-listers that are nominated for
other movies because their afraid that they either won't have a chance
at winning or if they do win, no one would take the award seriously.
Children need to be taken seriously.Today's movie Room may be a mother/son bonding story, but it's really
about the psychology that goes through their minds when after years of
being together, are going on a journey that separates them physically
and emotionally. It's about two people growing up despite being
different generations as Room portrays. Joy Newsome (played by Brie Larson) is a young woman that has been
living in a shed converted into a small home for the past seven years
by her kidnapper she calls "Old Nick" (played by Sean Bridgers). In the
time since, she gave birth to a child (fathered by Old Nick) that she
named Jack. In the years growing up there, Joy tried as hard as she
could to be a good mother and protect Jack from the situation and raise
him like any other child. Now turning five, Jack (played by Jacob
Tremblay) only sees the Room they live in as the world and that
anything outside is "outer space".Joy finds out that "Old Nick" has lost his job and is low on money,
which will mean fewer resources for food and heat. It is now that she
tells Jack about the outside world (the only thing they had for
information or entertainment was television that was mostly tuned onto
Dora the Explorer for Jack) and that they need to get out. She knows
that the only way out is if "Old Nick" realizes that Jack has to get
out due to illness. The first half of the movie is planning on the
escape and the second half is about what happens after wood.I can barley say anything about Room as most of the movie contains
major spoilers. All I can say is that even though this is a thriller, I
count this as a coming of age story. A really good one as well
considering that we have both a young woman and a little boy who know
little about the world around them. Brie Larson does phenomenal as Joy
who has the hard task of both remaining forever frightened of "Old
Nick" and being a proper mother.Speaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most
supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of
child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary
emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this
is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults
around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as
children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an
alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child
made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different
age.I'll give this ten imaginary dogs out of ten. Room is an emotional, but
rewarding coming of age story that may be hard to sit through the first
half. But once the second half starts, you'll realize how strong bonds
are between parents and children. You'll realize that in order to move
one, part of your old self has to go away. Room is one of the 2015's
best.

Room is wonderful. It made me laugh, cry, and put on my thinking cap,
all while earning it's rightful place in the thriller genre. There were
moments of sheer suspense akin to Hitchcock's most nail-biting
sequences. Room is as much a study of the oppressed human psyche as it
is a breathtaking observation of a five year-old discovering a world
beyond captivity. The director here is at the top of his game. Though
he crafts such heart stopping sequences of suspense, his true genius
lies in his ability to take simple shots of what we're so used to
seeing everyday: trees, clouds, cityscapes, etc., and turn them into
borderline-hypnotic images of strange, exciting, new things. It is
truly an experience like none other. At the heart of this movie is the
story of a relationship between a mother and son. The two main
characters are so intriguing and, right from the start, you feel as if
you're taking this journey with them into the outside world. Room is a
masterwork. All the elements needed to make a fantastic film have
fallen into place here. Please, go see this movie!

A woman and her son are held in a garden shed, referred to as 'room',
by a man who uses the woman as his sex slave, having abducted her 7
years earlier. The woman concocts a plan to smuggle the son out in
order for him to find help and free them. After the plan is
successfully executed, we follow the two in the aftermath of the
ordeal, struggling to retrieve the life that was previously stolen from
her.The film is repetitive and annoying. At no point is the captivity nor
the woman's response to the situation believable. It's just a garden
shed located in some suburb instead of underground. The woman's not
shackled and can virtually escape every time the captor enters the
room. Relying on child actors is a notoriously shaky endeavour and again the
constant whining of the kid and the way it talks, is grating and
tiresome. There also seems to be no real connect between the first and
second act. The 7 years she previously spent in the room might just as
well have been a written premise at the start of the film. With no
deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the
film feels aimless and not well thought-through.3/10

. . . that is far easier to take allegorically than in any literal
sense of story-telling. As a linear tale, ROOM is deeply flawed,
building to its primary climax just 58 minutes into the 118-minute
feature film, and then tacking on a pretty boring final hour (that
mostly emptied my American theater by the end of the showing). However,
when astute viewers realize that the main characters and locales in
ROOM are standing in for other things, the flick as a whole is much
easier to take. Perhaps if it was more directly titled (CANADIAN
CONFESSIONS, for instance) more people in the world film market might
"get" it. This movie is suggesting that most if not all Canadians feel
trapped in a cold, squalid room or shed--sort of a back bay to the Real
World tantalizingly close (but a world away) just South of their
border. The ironically named Mom here, "Joy," tries to convince son
Jack that every wall has two sides, but Jack's not really buying it.
Jack's kidnapper\rapist father, of course, is meant to represent Uncle
Sam, that is, America. And Jack himself, certainly, stands in for the
Canadian film industry, infamous for being comprised of a million
counterfeit Americas--amazingly including ROOM itself (C'Mon, guys,
don't tell us ROOM is in "America," and then show a
politically-incorrect "Apache Burger" joint just down the block in
Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada!). When Joy, with Jack's help,
escapes ROOM (for the wider world of America, allegorically speaking),
she has so much regret over what she's missed during the prime of her
life the past seven years she attempts suicide. Only Jack (that is, the
fraudulent Canadian film industry, the country's main export now that
the XL Pipeline won't be spewing nation-killing tar sands oil to the
rest of the planet) is able to cheer up Joy (at least, while in some
sort of confined ROOM, such as a theater or shed).

Room -A gross irresponsibility of the writer of this film, along with a
supporting production crew, and cast. The story glamorizes the process
of being held hostage, using a young women and her child. I am afraid
why a story teller would choose such a topic, and why would he be so
consumed as to make a message of this to the general population.
Although it may seem cute at first seeing how a boy senses the room,
and world around him; I am left with the taste that it only
desensitizes others. This is not a story we should expose ourselves to
like this, as a human race we might be tempted to play it down if it
happens to others in real life, or make it seem to others it is not so
bad to commit such an act to others.There is a responsibility here when you interact with the public. I
realize art is based on trying to work through what happens to you or
what you have experienced, the art part being you are trying to get
others to feel and communicate with you and what you are experiencing.
But if that be the case here, then a more appropriate form of art in
the direction of it should have been a movie portraying the horror of
being held captive, and better yet maybe even realize this is too hard
a topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the
general public to consume. I give this film a rating of zero, and suggest this film maker and crew
take a different occupation to make money. I don't want to be a part of
any of it anymore. And yes, there are many movies which could be
labeled as I did with this one, but someone should write an honest
review, a responsible review.

It opens badly, but this is deceptive. If you watch carefully, are
very, very patient, look at what's actually there, and give it three
minutes-----it gets worse. But wait. This too is unfair. Are you
actually seeing what's in front of your eyes? Are you sure? The film
demands that you give it at least another ten minutes, and you do. And
as soon as you do, it gets worse. After that it gets worse, and then
worse, and worse, and worse. And it's only just begun. The setting
hasn't even left the room. Then it does. Finally. Surprise! A goodly
portion of the film, in fact, at least 30 percent, takes place outside
the room. I have no idea why. To show that the outside world is just as
claustrophobic? That would've been a good point, but the story doesn't
allow it! The writer is adrift. The shift of scenery doesn't help. It
makes Room even worse - and it gets worse yet, and even worse than
that, despite the brief, welcome, charitable appearance of two superbly
talented actors (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) who can actually act,
whether they have a character to play or not. Acting, in fact, is not
an issue in the movie. To be fair, the child star of the film, Jacob
Tremblay (made deliberately genderless as only a 5-year-old could be)
gives as execrable a performance as any adult ever has, and deserves a
lot of credit for it. If the director intended it that way, he probably
either has no children, or doesn't know or like any. It's not totally
Tremblay's fault: he obviously found it impossible to believe in the
story, as did the writer, director, actors and producers who concocted
this infinitely boring, one-dimensional, unfelt drama. Here and there
throughout the story, that sickly, treacly piano that has invaded the
soundtrack of hundreds of anemic films like a skin rash makes an
appearance. To top it off, Room is made with the highest of production
values. They are the only values visible, and may lift the movie to the
heights of Trumpian emptiness. Americans love nothing better in their
movies: production values are the new family values. The overall
impression is of a movie, clunkily directed by Lenny Abrahamson,
written by someone (Emma Donoghue) whose entire experience of life must
have been acquired in a room, probably a classroom, possibly a
cloakroom, a writer unashamed to display her bad handwriting, and
constitutionally unable or unwilling to share with the public how
little she knows or cares about the world she inhabits. A lot has been
written about the hell the cinematographers went through to make parts
of this movie, jamming their equipment into a tiny cramped space for
countless hours. It doesn't show, and what does is not interesting. If
they'd shown us the hell, and not the Room they made of it, I'd have
had a lot less to say but would've left with more than a craving for a
quick burger on my mind.

'Room' is the harrowing story of isolationism, and then, later on,
immersion. We're first introduced to our two main characters,
twenty-something Ma (actress Brie Larson) and four year-old Jack
(up-and-coming Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of
course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's
immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight.
Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his
immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack
thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Ma, we're later told, has
been living in the confines for seven years. It's seven too many, and
when she decides quite suddenly that some attempt must be made to free
one or both of them, plans are quickly set in motion at her behest and
against Jack's wishes.I'm hesitant to mention their escape at all, but the always inexcusable
trailer not only alludes to the escape but presents it as a first- act
occurrence, mostly using the opportunity to list the other notable
actors of the production. It's an unfortunate introduction to the
story, as the audience does benefit from the time spent in the shed,
however fully expecting the scenery to change in a moment. We come to
understand their lifestyle: stretching in the morning, TV, eating
canned slop, TV, running from one end of the shed to the other, TV.
They have each other, and TV. It's been the source of Jack's
entertainment, and no doubt his education, for much of his life. So
when Ma tries to explain that TV holds some truth, that other people
exist, and so too does a world outside of Room, it's hard for Jack, now
5, to grasp. "How does it all fit?!" he asks out of a serious
incredulity (a single line delivered in a way that certifies Tremblay
is one to watch).Nevertheless, he does grasp it, or he pretends to. He audibly bounces
back and forth between acceptance and some acting form of denial, but
his trust in Ma ultimately outweighs his fear of something larger, and
then, halfway through the film, the outside is revealed to him. It's an
abrupt and belated transition and his daring escape doesn't seem at all
plausible but paints our everyday surroundings so empyrean that you
more than forgive it. Triumph of the realization is replaced with a
terror. Talking to the strange people he's only just recently come to
see as real instead of "magic" is too much, too soon.A female officer warms to Jack, and his bravery leads to Ma's rescue.
The two are reunited with the family he's never known, but a reluctance
to engage with anyone besides his Ma is apparent. By this time, the
film feels unbalanced. Its pacing is jarred, and the idea is that it's
supposed to, but it feels less like a new, eye- opening experience and
the slow understanding that comes with it, and more like a train wreck
in slow motion. The second half offers little to the viewer. The meat
of the story is left behind, and while it wasn't exactly Kobe beef,
what we're left with is little more than the canned slop our duo had
been subjected to in the beginning. Joan Allen does her best with what
little she's given, William H. Macy isn't much more than a snapshot and
a stepping stone to Ma's character development, Tom McCamus surprises,
and Sean Bridgers eerie acting as the deluded kidnapper is oddly missed
after his exit, which is without any real resolution.This proves to be a compelling story, and is at times emotionally
gripping, but is ultimately ill-fated for a film adaptation. Best
suited as prose, or as a journalistic publication on which the
narrative is based, it falters in being brought to screen. Neither
first-time feature screenwriter Emma Donoghue nor Lenny Abrahamson are
at fault, as both do greatly with what is to be offered, and the
casting, particularly the ever-impressive Larson, is inspired. Still,
in leaving the theater, something is left to be desired."Room" will prove to be a nice addition to the résumé of any involved,
but with little shelf life beyond the awards season.B-Andrew Paul, occuris.com
